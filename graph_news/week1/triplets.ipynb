       "  'content': \"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\\n\\nThe list of the world's wealthiest people mostly comprises the biggest shareholders of the largest companies on the planet. So why does the cofounder and CEO of the world's most valuable company rank just 10th?\\n\\nAs of Monday's close, Nvidia's Jensen Huang had a net worth of $147 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\n\\nThat puts him just behind Warren Buffett, who has a $148 billion fortune, even though Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is worth about a quarter as much as Nvidia, and Buffett has gifted more than half of his Berkshire stock to foundations since 2006.\\n\\nBernard Arnault ranks eighth with a $164 billion fortune, despite LVMH being worth under $300 billion, or less than a 10th of Nvidia.\\n\\nElon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, has an estimated net worth of $383 billion and could extend his lead if his proposed $1 trillion pay package is approved. That's striking as the two companies that make up the lion's share of Musk's wealth, Tesla and SpaceX, are together valued around $1.6 trillion — less than 40% of Nvidia's market value.\\n\\nDilution of shares\\n\\nThere's one reason Huang, who cofounded Nvidia in 1993 and has been the chipmaker's CEO ever since, isn't richer: dilution.\\n\\nAhead of Nvidia's IPO in 1999, Huang owned 12.8% of the company. That stake would be worth over $500 billion today.\\n\\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\\nWhile it's typical for founders to sell shares and see their ownership diluted when their companies go public, Huang has seen a far more significant and prolonged decline in his stake. It fell to 9.9% in 1999, 7.1% in 2003, 4.4% in 2010, then stabilized between 3.5% and 4% from 2020 through this summer, filings show.\\n\\nFor comparison, Buffett owns about 14% of Berkshire, Arnault owns roughly half of LVMH, and Musk owns around 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX.\\n\\nHuang's percentage ownership has dropped by more than two-thirds primarily because Nvidia has issued vast amounts of shares to provide equity for its employees. The company reported a hefty $14 billion of unearned stock-based compensation as of July 27, much of which it expected to recognize in around two years' time.\\n\\nNvidia has offset some of the dilution through stock buybacks, but its outstanding shares have surged from a split-adjusted 1.7 billion when it went public, to north of 23 billion now — a roughly 14-fold increase.\\n\\nMany companies, especially in the tech space, award employees with stock or stock options to incentivize them to increase the value of the company and its stock, while discouraging them from decamping to rivals. It's a way to attract and retain talent without spending cash.\\n\\nHuang's stake has also shrunk because he's sold shares, including a prearranged trading plan to dispose of up to 6 million shares this year, worth about $1 billion at Nvidia's current stock price.\\n\\nThe rich list changes as companies' market caps fluctuate, but Huang's smaller stake means he's unlikely to top it anytime soon.\",\n",

The technology enabled mass detentions in Xinjiang, where administrators assigned 100-point risk scores to Uyghurs with deductions for growing beards or being aged 15-55. Dell promoted a laptop with \"all-race recognition\" capabilities on its WeChat account in 2019. Thermo Fisher Scientific marketed DNA kits as \"designed\" for ethnic minorities including Uyghurs and Tibetans until August 2024.Oracle, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, Intel, NVIDIA, and VMware sold geographic mapping software, facial recognition systems, and cloud infrastructure to Chinese police through the 2010s. The surveillance network tracks \"key persons\" whose movements are restricted and monitored, with one estimate suggesting 55,000 to 110,000 people were placed under residential surveillance in the past decade.

       "  'content': \"00:00 Speaker A\\n\\nI want to shift gears to a discussion of hardware versus intellectual property. And just thinking about over the next 12 months, if you had to pick one bucket, and one of those could be chips and hardware with maybe Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony consoles, and then you have content and IP on the other, with Take two and Roblox and we'll get to the game, we'll get to, um, Grand Theft in a second. Where do you see that heading over the next year?\\n\\n00:32 Speaker B\\n\\nI mean, the hardware side's hard to play. Um, Nvidia obviously is a phenomenal company, but you know, a very small percentage, I think less than 5% of their revenue comes from gaming. So it might be 10, but it's really small. I think it's four or five billion a quarter out of 45 billion. So, you know, they're they're great, um, but they're not going to really grow that very much. They used to be more like 50% gaming for PC graphic processors. Um now it's all AI. So I love Nvidia, uh, but it's really not a gaming play. Nintendo is the pure play. Sony is not quite pure play because of studios and other things. But Nintendo is a pure play, uh hardware manufacturer that also happens to have a lot of great software. Um, and and you can participate there. The stock's at an all-time high. So, you know, it's fine. I think that there're probably some upside there. But I much, much prefer to play in the software side. Uh intellectual property is inexpensive to reproduce again and again and again, very high margin. So you want to play the guys that have the content or the guys that have the technology and that would include Unity and AppLovin.\\n\\n02:08 Speaker A\\n\\nAll right, let's stick with content and IP, talk about Grand Theft Auto 6. Uh, it's been a dozen years since five came out and I'm wondering what the expectations are and then the pricing point especially. I believe you've said it could reach triple digits.\\n\\n02:30 Speaker B\\n\\nYeah, I'm I'm pretty confident it will be $100. Um and you know, it's funny because I'm basing my guess on what the CEO Strauss Zelnick has said, which is that they're going to charge what they believe that the game is worth and consumers will feel that they got a value for what they're paying. No no no point in making that comment if you're going to charge 60 or 70 bucks. So just the idea that he's addressed price tells me it's going to start at 100, and I don't think gamers are going to even flinch. Um, this game is going to be probably twice as big as the last one. Uh as you pointed out, 12 years in development, it'll come out, uh just shy of the 13th anniversary of the last release. They have 1,200 people working on it, which means they're spending way north of 100 million per year on development cost. So they've got a billion, billion five invested in the game. Why not charge 100 bucks? And and the truth is, gamers are an entitled bunch of whiny little babies, but but the truth, you know, they they can wait a year if they don't want to pay 100 bucks. They can buy it at 70 next year. And I think Take two will charge 100. I think they will sell 30 or 40 or 50 million units at 100 bucks and that incremental $30 is virtually all profit. So if they can make an extra two or three billion dollars, why not?\",\n",

       " {'headline': 'AI expert says it’s ‘not a question’ that AI will take over all jobs—but people will have 80 hours a week of free time',\n",
       "  'content': 'While many CEOs are pausing hiring while they wait and see what jobs AI could replace, one AI expert warns that nearly all roles are at risk. Professor of computer science Dr. Roman Yampolskiy predicts that 99% of work will be placed by AI and humanoid robots in the next five years, and there will be no “plan B” in retraining for a new job. On the plus side, however, he predicts that humans will have 60 to 80 hours freed up per week, thanks to not having to work.\\n\\nIt’s only been three years since OpenAI released ChatGPT into the world, and companies are already shaving down their workforces to make way for AI automation. This has left many employees clinging to their jobs for dear life—but according to Dr. Roman Yampolskiy, a professor of computer science and leading voice in AI safety, no worker is safe.\\n\\nDespite cab drivers and even teachers like himself saying they’re irreplaceable, he said it’s inevitable that the technology will take over.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\n“That is not even a question if it’s possible,” Yampolskiy recently said on The Diary of a CEO podcast when discussing jobs being automated by AI. “It’s like, how soon before you [are] fired?”\\n\\nThe computer science professor has joined the cohort of tech leaders—including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla—raising the alarm bells that AI will trigger a jobs armageddon.\\n\\nBut while Amodei thinks that AI could swipe half of white-collar roles in the next five years, spiking unemployment up to 20%, Yampolskiy said that joblessness could reach as high as 99% in that same time frame. And contrary to popular belief, he thinks that workers won’t simply funnel into new roles that haven’t been disrupted or invented by AI yet.\\n\\n“Before we always said, ‘This job is going to be automated, retrain to do this other job,’” the AI expert said. “But if I’m telling you that all jobs will be automated, then there is no plan B. You cannot retrain.”\\n\\nThere will be record levels of unemployment—but he says humans will have 60 hours of freed time\\n\\nThe engineering professor is steadfast that nearly all jobs will be taken over by AI—even most of the ones that have a special human touch, like teachers and car drivers.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAnd the career paths that once guaranteed six-figure salaries are also on the way out; he pointed out the very popular computer science track, which he currently teaches at the University of Louisville, and has since been upended by AI.\\n\\n“Look at computer science. Two years ago, we told people ‘Learn to code—you are an artist, you cannot make money. Learn to code.’ Then we realized, ‘Oh, AI kind of knows how to code and [is] getting better. Become a prompt engineer. You can engineer prompts for AI. It’s going to be a great job. Get a four-year degree in it,’” Yampolskiy said on the podcast. “But then we’re like, ‘AI is way better at designing prompts for other AIs than any human.’ So that’s gone.”\\n\\nAs more jobs get replaced by AI, and roles that are created from this change also get automated, it’s an endless domino effect of unemployment. Yampolskiy warned joblessness will hit an all-time high in the next five years as all human work, including manual labor, is replaced by humanoid robots and AI agents.\\n\\n“We’re looking at a world where we have levels of unemployment we [have] never seen before,” he revealed. “[I’m] not talking about 10% unemployment, which is scary, but 99%. All you have left is jobs where, for whatever reason, you prefer another human would do it for you. But anything else can be fully automated.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nWhile that sounds like a dark reality for most workers, Yampolskiy doesn’t seem phased by the inevitable. In fact, he sees an upside in this huge workforce shift—just like other tech leaders, he says massive jobs automation will lead to shorter workweeks.\\n\\nHe echoes the likes of former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates—who said that we’ll clock in just two days a week in the next ten years—and Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang who predicts a four-day workweek. But Yampolskiy optimistically believes work will be scrapped entirely, leaving humans with the question of how they’ll spend their free time.\\n\\n“I don’t think there is a, ‘This occupation needs to learn to do this instead.’ I think it’s more like, ‘We as a humanity, then we all lose our jobs. What do we do? What do we do financially? Who’s paying for us? And what do we do in terms of meaning? What do I do with my extra 60, 80 hours a week?’”\\n\\nYampolskiy isn’t positive where that money is going to come from, but other tech leaders, like Elon Musk, suggest that the technology will create the need for a “universal high income”—where people have access to all the money they need to survive without having a job. Though he isn’t explicit on how much each person would need every year.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\n“There will be no shortage of goods and services. It will be an age of abundance,” Musk told former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in 2023. “We won’t have universal basic income. We’ll have universal high income…In some sense, it’ll be somewhat of a leveler, an equalizer.”\\n\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com',\n",

The model is intended to be more focused on math, coding, and scientific research than most other AI chatbots.\\n\\nThe Emirati lab’s selling point for the model is similar to DeepSeek’s strategy that disrupted the AI market earlier this year: optimized efficiency that will have better or the same computing power at a lower cost.\\n\\n“By proving that smaller, more resourceful models can rival the largest reasoning systems, this milestone marks the beginning of the next wave of AI innovation,” Peng Xiao, council member of Abu Dhabi’s AI and Advanced Technology Council, said in the press release.\\n\\nXiao is also the CEO of G42, an Emirati AI development company that co-launched the K2 Think model. The company last made headlines for inking a multibillion-dollar data center deal with the Trump administration earlier this year, which has since been mired in national security concerns.\\n\\nThe lab is also aiming to be transparent in everything, “open-sourcing not just models but entire development processes” that provide “researchers with complete materials including training code, datasets, and model checkpoints,” IFM said in a press release from May.\\n\\nThe long-term plan is to incorporate K2 Think into a full LLM in the coming months, WIRED reported.\\n\\nBooming Emirati investment in AI\\n\\nThe Emiratis are serious about AI. The country counted 672 new AI companies between June 2023 and June 2024, making it the fastest-growing AI cluster in the Middle East and North Africa region.\\n\\nThe lab behind K2 Think was established by the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, which has its headquarters in Abu Dhabi and two research hubs in Silicon Valley and Paris. It was founded a couple of years ago as part of the Emirati government’s AI overhaul strategy, called Artificial Intelligence 2031. The university’s president is Chinese-born American researcher Dr. Eric Xing.\\n\\nThe Emirati AI overhaul has also benefited American companies. Abu Dhabi state AI fund MGX, chaired by the UAE’s national security adviser, is a founding partner of Trump’s Project Stargate, and the fund has previously invested in OpenAI.\\n\\nTrump also announced in May that Abu Dhabi and Washington were partnering to create the largest AI data center cluster outside of the U.S., built and operated by G42 —the company that co-launched K2 Think on Tuesday— and with the help of Nvidia, OpenAI, Cisco, Oracle, and Japanese firm Softbank.\\n\\nBut that deal has faced U.S. regulator scrutiny over security concerns, particularly regarding the UAE’s relationship with China. Chinese tech and AI firms like Huawei and Alibaba have been expanding their influence in the UAE and the Middle East at large.\\n\\nG42 specifically had several Chinese investments, which the company reportedly got rid of after pressure from the Biden administration over a $1.5 billion strategic investment by Microsoft.\\n\\nAI is the new oil in the Middle East\\n\\nThe Emirates’ growing bet on AI is driven by a desire to diversify investments and reduce its economic dependence on fossil fuels like oil and gas.\\n\\nThe trend is seen in the rest of the Arab world as well, particularly in the oil-rich Gulf states. Saudi Arabia created a $100 billion AI investment fund last year as part of an effort to diversify its oil-reliant economy by 2030.\\n\\nSaudi Arabian DataVolt is moving forward with plans to invest $20 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the United States.\\n\\nElsewhere in the Gulf, Qatar Investment Authority was a significant investor in American AI company Anthropic in a $13 billion funding round last week.\\n\\nMore countries seek to challenge U.S. and Chinese dominance in AI\\n\\nA growing list of countries is seeking to join the battle for global AI dominance that’s currently dominated by American and Chinese companies.\\n\\nIn the rest of Asia, Singapore is a rising power, with AI-friendly regulatory oversight that has spurred the launch of AI innovation hubs from tech giants like Microsoft.\\n\\nIn Europe, the French are making major AI plays. The French AI startup Mistral just secured a $1.5 billion investment by Dutch semiconductor maker ASML on Tuesday. Mistral is considered a major competitor to OpenAI in Europe.',\n",

       "  'content': \"0:05 spk_0\\n\\nWelcome to Stocks and Translation, Yahoo Finance's video podcast that cuts through the market mayhem, the noisy numbers, and the hyperbole to give you the information you need to make the right trade for your portfolio. I'm Jared Blickery, your host, and with me is Yahoo Finance's Allie Cannell, who's here to keep the discussion simple, accessible, and also lively. Today we're gonna be talking about theCooling labor market. If the Fed is once again too slow to cut rates and how to square that with a stock market that keeps hitting record highs. Our phrase of the day is the September effect. History says we're in the worst month of the year right now, and the weakness tends to come in the back half of the month. So how much do investors really need to care about history rhyming?And this episode is brought to you by the number 9.7. That's how many percentage points of pure profit you would have missed out on, had you panic sold after Liberation Day and missed the single best day of the year, how to make an investing plan that keeps you cool and calm when the headlines, they get scary.And today we're welcoming back Phil Rosen, co-founder of the Opening Bell Daily. He recently left Business Insider to build his independent data-driven markets outlet along with Anthony Pomliano, and he's also a published author, twice over, penning a collection of New York centric vignettes in lifeween moments, as well as a travel novel, everywhere but Home. So Phil, it is great to see you here.And uh we're gonna get to our phrase of the day, September effect in a minute. Just tell us how you're seeing the markets right now overall.\\n\\n1:35 spk_1\\n\\nSo, uh, first of all, thank you both for having me. It's great to be back. Um, the market right now, we have a lot of positive momentum and I think that is the, the twist in history right now. So typically we're going into September, very weak and very jittery and investors across the board are expecting this pull back, but I do think.This year, uh, you know, famous last words this time is different. However, uh, the rate cut on September 17th, which is pretty much guaranteed at this point, I think that is going to see markets finish higher in September, which is very unusual because I think in the last 10 years September's finished down 2% on average, and if you go back to 1950, it's down like 0.8% or something like that. Yeah,\\n\\n2:18 spk_0\\n\\nand so that's perfect. Let's get into our phrase of the day that would be the September effect.And this is the historical tendency for stocks to post returns that are weaker in September than the other months, and it's important to note that this is just a pattern based on history, which may or may not pan out, but I'm wondering how you think about seasonality in general, seasonality just being, you know,The same types of things, patterns that we see in the market happen year after year. How much do they play into your analysis?\\n\\n2:46 spk_1\\n\\nSo I think a lot of this, especially in September, is a self-fulfilling prophecy, right? Investors are expecting this September effect to take hold, but again,I don't know if it applies as much this year because this has also been one of the wildest, most eventful years in market history, and you know we all know this as reporters we're writing about it every day, but we have, uh, the Federal Reserve has been pushing back and forth with the White House. We have these tariffs and we have this now widely expected rate cut in a week. So all this, I think anything is uh up for grabs right now, but I, I don't think seasonality will have as much of a play.As history suggests, you\\n\\n3:28 spk_2\\n\\ncan even look at go away. That that trend did not work\\n\\n3:32 spk_0\\n\\nout. Yeah, well, I, and I've done, I've done some studies on this go away. It's more like hedge and may and go away. It's evolved over the years, but we've seen different patterns from like 1940s to 1980s versus 1980s to now.Um, you've said some interesting things here, and you mentioned the fact that this is a wild year, Phil, and I was looking at seasonality coming into the, uh, the Trump presidency, and you can do seasonality. You can slice it, uh, and dice it several different ways. And one of the ways is to look at what year of the presidential cycle we're in. This is the first year. This is Donald, even though it's his 2nd term, it's his first year of this term.And I got to tell you what happened around liberation Day completely destroyed the seasonality chart, and then the market kind of came back and it seemed like at the end of August, we were right on track again according to some models. But in general, just talk to us about, especially maybe as, as in terms of how you cover these markets, what you've seen and how this has surprised you this year, some of the wildcards.\\n\\n4:29 spk_1\\n\\nSo I, I think right now the S&P 500.Actually having a better than average year generally, but also a better than average post-election year. So all this is going against the, let's say the tariff doomers in the start of the year. Everyone thought tariffs would destroy the market. They thought the Fed independence battle that would also destroy the market, but pretty much investors have not even paid attention to this, uh, let's say when you zoom out. So I, I think, um.A lot of the bearishness has been sort of eked out of the market right now, and almost every single firm has turned bullish for the year, and uh this.The narrative of betting against the Bears, I think that is the story of the year because the Bears have been the loudest, certainly in the first half of the year, but all the Bulls have been the ones that ended up right.\\n\\n5:18 spk_2\\n\\nBut it is interesting to me as a reporter like you were saying, covering this day in and day out, there are a lot of bulls out there, but there also are more cautious voices even when we talk about rate cuts, Eddie Denny from your Denny Research, he's a fan of the show, friend of the show, and he said that maybe the Fed shouldn't be cutting right now, and that could actually maybe lead to a market melt up and there could be a lot of money running in here at a time when you haveInflation that's still hot. There's also this debate about whether or not we're not too heavy, too concentrated in the market. So it does feel like at the same time there are a lot of unknowns and there is this tension among strategists about what comes next.\\n\\n6:01 spk_1\\n\\nSo I think your Danny is definitely not alone in that view, right? And I read his research all the time. He's super smart. I will say our team at opening Bill Daily, we've pretty much been calling for a rate cut.It's about March. Um, so we do think the Fed has been slow to respond in policy, and I think the, the jobs report really confirmedthat.\\n\\n6:22 spk_0\\n\\nYeah, that was that was dismal in a lot of ways. And then we know, we learned retroactively that one of the months, a few months ago, I think it was June turned negative and that's always had it, had it been negative in June, we probably would have had a rate cut already. And so that kind of brings to the forefront the issue is Jerome Powell and the Fed a little bit too late? What do you think about that?\\n\\n6:42 spk_1\\n\\nI do think they are too late, but I don't think it's necessarily Jerome Powell's fault. I think it's a structural deficiency of the Fed because it's a backward looking institution, right? But markets move so rapidly the economy can change faster than we think, but the Fed is pretty much working with uh a backward looking.Mandate, right? And then also the data can be hit or miss on whether you believe it or not. Maybe not believe is not the right word, but it's always revised, right? So the Fed's working with a pretty difficult circumstance. So I, I, I don't know if it's necessarily Jerome Powell. I think if anyone was in theThat job, they would probably be late this year.\\n\\n7:20 spk_0\\n\\nYeah, I don't, I don't envy anybody in that slot. You just brought up the data and I'm wondering what you've, you've thought about all the controversy surrounding the BLS, um, and a lot of this comes from the fact that since the pandemic, peoplehaven't been responding to these government surveys and so there's, you can't, you can't rely on the data as much. The margin of error is greater. And so I think it's no surprise that we have June being revised negative. There's a, there's a huge uh leeway that you got to give this data. So what do you think about the issue that, um, you know, Trump has raised the question of integrity. Do you think that's an issue?\\n\\n7:56 spk_1\\n\\nSo I, I don't know if replacing the head of the BLS is going to change the integrity of the data. I think the data was pretty, um, let's say, uh, it was gonna be revised no matter who is in charge, right? So I don't know if Trump putting his own person in there is gonna improve or worsen the data because I, I think it's, again, these are very old, you know.Methods that they're using to track all this data and I for one, I try to look at alternative sources of data, try to accrue a bunch of different sources when I make my analysis on the market and I would never just rely on let's say the BLS to determine what I think is gonna happen next in the market.\\n\\n8:36 spk_2\\n\\nSo what are those sources of data for you.really inform your viewpoints when it\\n\\n8:40 spk_0\\n\\ncomes to what do you look at every morning? Yeah.\\n\\n8:42 spk_1\\n\\nSo I, I think anecdotally, um, I talked to a lot of people, so I talked to a lot of strategists, as you both do. I talked to a lot of economists, and I talked to people in hiring manager, manager positions, right? Are they hiring? Are they not hiring? Um, you know, I actually met this engineer the other day and um.He told me that, so he's been at this firm for about a decade, this is a big tech company, and he used to do 2 interviews a week. This was about a year and a half ago, and now he does about an interview per quarter, and to me that was like a very uh red flag, let's say on the labor market.\\n\\n9:17 spk_0\\n\\nI want to talk about some of the market stuff that we're seeing. concentration has been a big issue, you know, do we, is too much of the market's gain due to just a few companies and arguably it's been that case over the last few years. And the other thing is we're in the 3rd year of this bull market now.And that's typically, you don't see the gains that you saw in the first two years. I would say 23 and 24, we had gains of 20+% and the S&P 500, now we're looking, I think we're on track for 9 or 10, which is not bad, uh, for especially for a third year, but how do you see the concentration issue evolving?\\n\\n9:50 spk_1\\n\\nSo I, I do think that's a very um relevant issue to talk about, right? It's super concentrated we're at dotcom levels and that's certainly not a comparison you want to hear in any context. You never want to be compared to the dotcom bubble, um, but I, I think the difference today is that the companies that are at the top of this concentration, the mag 7, right, we've never seen companies this profitable with this large balance sheets.And that to me that does give some cushion to that concentration argument right that the earnings have justified it maybe, yes, I, I think earnings have definitely justified it and I don't know if that's gonna last for much longer, but up to this point, I don't think it's um let's say something we should be overly concerned about. And again, I, I think I've seen um.S&P 493 earnings are slowly gonna catch up in the coming quarters while Mag 7 slows down, so that is something I think worth monitoring as well. Yeah,\\n\\n10:43 spk_2\\n\\nand Torsten Stock from Apollo, our parent company, he did publish uh quite a bit of research about how concentrated we are in this market, and that's because of those hyper scalers and the data demand and how much CapEx they're spending.Given that we just finished wrapped up this latest earnings season, were there any little signs that maybe that demand is starting to weaken just just a little bit? I know Nvidia missed on data center revenue. Was that concerning to you at all?\\n\\n11:10 spk_1\\n\\nSo I'm not sure if I have much to say on the side of that, but I do know we've never seen this S&P 50.earnings calls mention AI, right? So that's, you know, on one hand, you can say, oh, there's a top signal, who knows? Um, and then we also have um data center spend is, that's, that's going to keep increasing for probably several more quarters. Um, so all these things, it's like the\\n\\n11:34 spk_2\\n\\nmining.\\n\\n11:39 spk_1\\n\\nYou could argue very convincingly that there is a lot of froth in the market right now with AI, with crypto, with some of these meme stocks, but also you could take the other side and say earnings have been phenomenal and they're projected to be phenomenal again in the 4th quarter. That's why\\n\\n11:56 spk_2\\n\\nI think this market's been a little confusing because you can argue both sides of that equation, and we talk about retail traders, unprofitable tech that that's been leading the meme stocks like you mentioned.They're sort of bleeding this market higher and dragging the institutions along with it. So that's been something that I, yeah,\\n\\n12:12 spk_0\\n\\nI see that too, Ali. Hold that thought though, because guess what, we got to take a short break. Coming up, we're going to break down the number that captures market regret and a runway battle between David and Goliath, but with stocks, of course.This episode is brought to you by the number 9.7% points. That's how much profit you would have missed out on had you sold at the Lowe's after that scary post-liberation Day sell off and missed the April 9th rally. So one day, nearly 10%, and Phil, I'm saying this because it kind of opens up a discussion in a market psychology and about staying invested, all these things that we like to talk about. How do you, how do you think about this phenomenon and how do you keep, how do you tune out the noise?That's all in the media.\\n\\n13:05 spk_1\\n\\nThat's a very difficult and timeless question. Um, I, I think if you are someone with a 30 year investing horizon, you can pretty much ignore the news, right? And I say that as someone who's in the news, um, and\\n\\n13:17 spk_0\\n\\nwho probably has a 30 year investment horizon.\\n\\n13:19 spk_1\\n\\nYes, yes, exactly. So, um, for myself, um.I do think that the day to day fluctuations of the market, maybe the tariff scares or the Fed independence scares, all this stuff, it's intense in the moment, but if you're looking decades in advance, odds are your portfolio will be just fine if you just leave it as is and and stick to your plans, stick to your dollar cost averaging all those things.\\n\\n13:42 spk_2\\n\\nYeah, and when we talk about the record highs that we've been seeing and Jared was just mentioning some of the returns that we've had over the past few years, and then you try and match that with the state of the US economy and post-COVID we did see a struggle with inflation really rampant. A lot of everyday Americans were underwater, yet we had these double digit gains in the stock market.So how, how do you really square that when it comes to assessing the status of the economy while also what we're seeing with stocks at record highs?\\n\\n14:16 spk_1\\n\\nThat's a great question. So we've seen this phrase a tale of two economies, right? I think you pretty much have your asset allocators and then those that aren't in the market, and there's really been a clear winner and loser story here. And um if youYou know, the short of it, if you've been in the market, you've done very well, and if not, your dollar has lost purchasing power dramatically over the last 5 years. I think since 2020 we've probably lost 25% to 28% of our 1 dollar's purchasing power. So that is very significant. And if you were in the market, then you've been able to keep up or beat that, um.Let's say loss in purchasing power, but if not, you really can't buy as much as you could. Um, so these are, uh, these are structural issues thatReally points to the importance of investing, I think, um, but it also points to the uh probably the widening inequality gapas well.\\n\\n15:09 spk_2\\n\\nMaybe the types of companies you invest in too, because those that are more exposed to that lower income consumer, they have been reporting a little bit more of astruggle.\\n\\n15:18 spk_0\\n\\nYou've brought up a great point. I want to launch off that because you, you sent us a chart a few hours ago. Dollar General and Dollar Tree, two companies that are known to do well when the consumer is feeling a little bit off andTheir pockets are a little bit pinched. They are outperforming most of the other retail companies, especially the big box retailers this year. Not only that, they're outperforming Nvidia. So talk to us about that phenomenon. What do you think ofthat?\\n\\n15:42 spk_1\\n\\nSo when I saw those numbers and I sort of put the stocks on a line chart.I was very shocked and uh because Nvidia is the story of the year, right? Everyone loves this stock, earnings are the Super Bowl, all this, but Dollar Tree and Dollar General are beating it by I think by double digit digits still. Um, and the CEO of Dollar Tree at the last earnings call said.The majority of their new customers in the last quarter were six figure households. So that, that's, I read that and it was a baffling stat because you wouldn't assume that a six figure, uh, you know, high income household is going to a dollar store. Um, and I will say I love dollar stores likewise, I, I love a dollar store, um.But that points to this sort of flights of value, right? So everyday consumers regardless of income bracket are looking to stretch their dollars more and that goes to the loss of purchasing power, it goes to inflation, it goes to high interest rates. So all these things, um, it is pointing to a constrained consumer, I think.\\n\\n16:40 spk_2\\n\\nYeah, and, and when you talk about the dollar, I mean, I think year to date we've lost about 10% compared to other types of currencies, and it's interesting to look at that and then look at gold, which is now at record highs right around, let's talk about gold bucks. I mean, where is that mostly foreign investors piling into gold? Is it the expectation of rate cuts? What, what do you think has been driving kind of that side of the market?\\n\\n17:03 spk_1\\n\\nThat's a great question. Um, I, I think part of it is a lot of governments and central banks are buying gold, right? China, Russia, yeah. So I think that's, uh, you know, I don't know what percent they're driving, but that's probably a huge chunk of it. And then you have, um, Bitcoin as well has seen a similar, very strong year. Um, so you have central bank and government buying, I think you have retail catching on to this gold trade.And then you also have the general narrative, I think of you want to hedge against dollar debasement and gold and Bitcoin are are the best ways to play that, according to most people.\\n\\n17:36 spk_0\\n\\nWhat do you think of all these Bitcoin treasury companies, not just Bitcoin. Now we're seeing Ethereum treasury companies, people piling into the micro strategy, which almost got just got in, uh, added to the S&P 5.didn't quite make it. But uh Solana too, what do you think of all this, all this phenomenon?\\n\\n17:52 spk_1\\n\\nFirst of all, I think with the micro strategy not getting added, there were definitely some politics at play there. Um, I don't know the details, but it was so eligible, right, but it didn't get picked. Um and as far as the the broader Bitcoin treasury trend, um, this, you could say from a very high level.Is a bet that the dollar will continue to lose its value and Bitcoin will continue to appreciate over time so why wouldn't want, why wouldn't you want your balance sheet to be denominated in the asset that's gonna appreciate rather than get debased? So I think very simply and from a very high level that's what we're looking at and again you might be.Able to point out some froth in the market because there's been a lot of these popping up and I, I think we're seeing other crypto assets being put on balance sheets as well so that also suggests uh OK, are we getting overextended here but uh right now uh.I think the the train is still gonna keep going.\\n\\n18:50 spk_0\\n\\nAll right, we got to get to our runway battle today because on who are better. We are crowning a market leader and we are pitting the mega cap giants against their small cap cousins. On the left catwalk struts the mega cap moat, armor plated balance sheets, thick margins, and a wardrobe of buybacks. When the lights flicker, these names don't flinch. They just tighten their costs and keep the cash flows of coming. On the right runway, we've got thisAll caps scramble, cyclical energy turnaround stories and tags that still say discount. When the economy accelerates and money gets cheaper, these names rip. But rate cuts are a double-edged sword because if the Fed is too late, small caps, they get torn to shreds, while large caps, well, they suffer too, but typically a bit less. So Phil, you don't need to pick a religion here. We just want to know which closet you're wearing and why, who wears it better over the next year, Mega cap moat or theSmall cap scramble.\\n\\n19:43 spk_1\\n\\nThat'sa, that's a hell of an intro. Um, I, I would say from this point to year end, if we get, let's say 2 to 3 rate cuts, I think small caps will do very well. They're very interest rate sensitive and I think, um, large caps, you could also argue are getting a bit overextended despite the earnings that have been sogood.\\n\\n20:01 spk_2\\n\\nWhat if we only get one this\\n\\n20:03 spk_0\\n\\nyear or 10. That's not a good sign.\\n\\n20:08 spk_1\\n\\nUm.One cut, I would probably lean more towards mega caps, but I don't think we'll only get one cut. I think we'll probably get 3 by by December, I think so.\\n\\n20:17 spk_2\\n\\nYeah. And what do you think we'll drive that the continued deterioration of the labor market, or do you think the inflation side of the picture if that comes in hot this week, could that maybe give the Fed some pause?\\n\\n20:27 spk_1\\n\\nI think even if inflation comes in hot, the Fed has pretty much conceded that they're gonna let inflation run hot so I think they're gonna look at the labor market and they're also of course the the political pressure whether you say they're buckling or not, it's definitely a factor. So I, I think they're gonna let inflation.Rise, even if, you know, whether it rise or not, they're not going to be worried about that right now.\\n\\n20:47 spk_0\\n\\nPhil, at the beginning of the show, I mentioned you are an accomplished author, and I have read your book Life Between Moments. I love it. Tell us about your journey into writing fiction and how that's kind of uh maybe jive with your job here at Morning Bell.\\n\\n21:02 spk_1\\n\\nThat's that's deep in the archives there. Um, I think writing fiction has helped me, uh, just be a better writer in general, right? It helps me use differentUm, literary tools in my financial reporting, and I think it makes me, uh, understand the psychology of things a bit better. And yeah, that book really, uh, I wrote it when I was at Business Insider, and, uh, I would go home after work and spend maybe 30 to an hour on it a day, finished it in a year, and then published it and uh it has nothing to do with markets, nothing to do with Wall Street, um, but it was a great passion.of mine at the time and I'm honored you even know about it. Hey,\\n\\n21:38 spk_0\\n\\nIencourage everybody to read it, download it, get the Kindle some great stories in there. All right, so what did we learn today? We talked about the September and that's the seasonality play. It's just a tendency. It doesn't mean you have to get all scared because September tends to close down, but we do have some other orange or yellow flash.Warning signs and some of those have to do with the fact that the Fed might be a little bit behind the eight ball. We got a deteriorating labor market. But what's most important is that investors keep their, uh, keep their head on their accounts and not necessarily responding to the news on a day by day basis, uh, because the, the market itself, the S&P 500, yes, it's concentrated, but we've seenThis concentrated persists for long periods of time over history. So that's gonna do it for today.

       " {'headline': 'The XFX Radeon RX 7900 XT Graphics Card Drops to $630: This Is the Least Expensive 4K-Capable GPU',\n",
       "  'content': \"If you've just upgraded to a new 4K gaming monitor and now you're looking for a reasonably priced GPU that can comfortably run games off it, then check out this deal. Amazon is offering the XFX AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT 20GB graphics card for just $630.63. This is the lowest price I've ever seen for an RX 7900 XT GPU, and that's saying something because nearly all video cards nowadays are higher than their original launch price. The RX 7900 XT is a generation old, but it's still an excellent 4K GPU that approaches the performance of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and Radeon 9070 XT.\\n\\nThe Radeon RX 7900 XT was released back in 2022, but its still a relevant card today, able to play pretty much any game at 4K with consistent framerates of 60fps and beyond. Compared to current generation cards, it's roughly 5%-10% behind the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and and the AMD Radeon 9070 XT in 4K rasterized (non ray-traced) performance. It's also 10%-20% less expensive, making it a very attractive alternative for those of you who are on a budget. The RX 7900 XT also comes equipped with 20GB VRAM, which is more than the 5070 T iand 9070 XT, which come with 16GB. The extra VRAM allows it to scale well in high-resolution gaming and it's also a good card for AI use.\\n\\nIf You Need Ray Tracing, Stick with NVIDIA\\n\\nAMD Radeon cards are outstanding alternatives to the NVIDIA GeForce cards. For gamers who want to maximize their performance for their dollar, AMD GPUs are the way to go. However, if you're set on playing 4K games with ray tracing enabled, then you'll want to stick with NVIDIA. That's because the GeForce cards perform better than their Radeon counterparts when it comes to ray tracing. Ray tracing is a form of rendering that allows for more realstic lighting effects. It makes light sources and shadows look better, but at the steep cost of GPU resources.\\n\\nWhy Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?

       " {'headline': \"Nvidia's CFO says there's still 'a little geopolitical situation that we need to work through' before shipping its AI GPUs to China, but it's 'a $2 billion to $5 billion potential opportunity'\",\n",
       "  'content': 'Nvidia\\'s executive vice president and chief financial officer, Collette Kress, spoke yesterday at the Goldman Sachs Communicopea event about a variety of topics, including a discussion of its recent financial results and the ongoing situation regarding its dealings with China. When asked for an update on demand for its H20 AI GPU in the country, and what needs to happen before it\\'s potentially shipped in the second-to-last quarter of this year, Kress said:\\n\\n\"Yes, we did receive a license approval and have received licenses for several of our key customers in China. And we do want that opportunity to complete that and actually ship the H20 architecture to them.\\n\\n\"Right now, there is still… a little geopolitical situation that we need to work through between the two governments,\" Kress continued. \"Our customers in China do want to make sure that [the] China government is also very well received in terms of receiving the H20 to them. But we do believe there is a strong possibility that this will occur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And so it could add additional revenue. It\\'s still hard to determine how much within the quarter. We talked about it being about a $2 billion to $5 billion potential opportunity if we can get through that geopolitical statement.\"\\n\\nWe reported last week that tech firms in China, including TikTok owner ByteDance, were reportedly waiting on their GPUs to arrive after placing orders back in July, when Nvidia was first said to be in the process of obtaining the appropriate licenses, with assurances from the US government they would be granted. Since then, Chinese data center operators have been given orders to obtain at least 50% of their chips from domestic manufacturers, while it\\'s also been claimed that Nvidia has suspended production of the H20 chip after security concerns were raised by Chinese officials.\\n\\n(Image credit: Nvida)\\n\\nSo, by the looks of things, while licenses have indeed been granted to Nvidia to sell its H20 GPUs to China, there are still some serious headwinds to work through before the powerful AI hardware actually arrives on Chinese shores. It certainly seems like Nvidia is confident everything will get straightened out eventually, but this \"little geopolitical situation\" seems to be gumming up the works significantly.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill, with an estimated $2 to $5 billion of additional revenue on the line, I\\'d imagine Nvidia is working hard behind the scenes with both governments to come to a resolution. Us gamers may no longer be the biggest revenue driver for the company, but part of me wonders if the geopolitical intricacies of selling AI hardware to China amid confusing tariffs, export restrictions, and perceived political brinksmanship between the US and Chinese governments has ended up being more of a headache than Nvidia first imagined.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe humble consumer GPU enthusiasts are usually mostly interested in gaming performance and pricing, which I\\'d say makes us easier customers to deal with. Still, swimming in deep waters attracts big fish, and it seems like Nvidia might still have some paddling to do before reeling in its multi-billion-dollar prize.',\n",

       "  'content': \"AMD's FSR 4 is now available in most FSR 3.1 and DX12 supported games\\n\\nThe new Adrenalin Software driver allows users to override FSR 3.1 with FSR 4\\n\\nIt only works in games that have a signed FSR 3.1 DLL\\n\\nWhile AMD fans await an eventual FSR 4 backport to older non-RDNA 4 graphics cards alongside updates to the upscaling technology that's exclusive to some of the best GPUs on the market, Team Red has at least made life easier for developers and gamers.\\n\\nAs reported by VideoCardz, AMD's latest driver 25.9.1 adds further FSR 4 support for most FSR 3.1 and DX12-supported games, which AMD says is now 'over 85 games'. RDNA 4 GPU owners simply need to enable FSR 4 on the AMD Adrenalin Software and toggle on FSR 3.1 in a supported game, allowing the driver to override FSR 3.1 with FSR 4.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that this is only possible in games that have a signed FSR 3.1 DLL, which means the override won't work via third-party integration. While FSR 4 still hasn't been backported to RDNA 3 and older GPUs, FSR 4's driver override should make things much easier if a backport does happen soon.\\n\\nTeam Red's recent FSR 4 open-source slip-up revealed that it was (and potentially still is) working on an FSR 4 backport to RDNA 3. And with the FSR 'Redstone' presentation set to reveal frame generation and image quality improvements, it may not be far-fetched to suggest that AMD may have another surprise announcement in store.\\n\\nAMD's fierce rival, Nvidia, has DLSS 4 available for all RTX GPUs; not only does it have the advantage of being widely available to more PC gamers, but the image quality is superior to FSR 4's, and there's nothing better than AMD's Redstone shortening the gap to Team Green's offering, while also allowing all (or at least most) Radeon GPU users to benefit from sharper images in games.\\n\\nAnalysis: FSR 4 on RDNA 3 and older GPUs should be AMD's number one priority\\n\\n(Image credit: AMD)\\n\\nWithout a doubt, Nvidia is still leading the GPU market. That's unsurprising, especially since the RTX 5000 series GPUs are gradually plummeting back to their launch prices – and Team Green is rumored to be launching Super series GPUs this fall.\\n\\nWith this in mind, it's time for AMD to at least provide its latest upscaling tech to RDNA 3 GPUs before Nvidia bridges the gap further.\\n\\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\\n\\nAgain, Nvidia already has DLSS 4 available on all RTX GPUs, except for Multi Frame Generation (exclusive to RTX 5000 series) and Frame Generation (starting from RTX 4000 series). DLSS 4 has shown how vital it is for upscaling tech to have sharper super-resolution image quality, and it shines bright even in DLSS performance, which benefits PC gamers with low-end hardware.\\n\\nTeam Red's FSR 4 has a similar effect with better image quality across its upscaling modes, and while it certainly doesn't match up to DLSS 4, it beats both FSR 3 and DLSS 3. As a handheld PC gamer, FSR 4 would do wonders at providing better performance via aggressive upscaling, without too much of a heavy sacrifice on image quality, like FSR 3 has.\\n\\nIt's the ideal time for AMD to get this going, as it would add to the firepower it needs to fully compete with its GPU rival.\",\n",

So I know I read this stuff and it says okay well this is a threat, an existential threat to NVIDIA and NVIDIA stock is down and then I read Ben Reitzes, who’s been the most right about this, particularly with Hock, with the CEO of Broadcom, he says no time to debate about, there’s so much business, there is a huge amount of business.\\n\\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

CGMatter has already made a whole bunch of addons, and one of his latest is the hand-drawn sketch emulator Pencil Pro (also see our roundup of Blender tutorials).\\n\\nPencil Pro Tutorial - YouTube Watch On\\n\\nPencil Pro is a Blender addon that can be used to imitate the look of hand-drawn sketches. It works on any kind of mesh, and it's more detailed than converters that rely on materials because it actually simulates how someone would draw.\\n\\nIt deals with the placement, direction and pressure of strokes and decides if cross-hatching and shading would work for every frame on the fly. No UVs are needed and it can work with any lighting.\\n\\nAs creator CGMatter notes, believable drawings come from a combination of shading and general pencil strokes, and Pencil Pro accounts for both. It uses screen coordinates rather than grunge on a 3D mesh, so you never run out of shading detail, and it looks at edge flow to approximate how pencil strokes usually follow the curvature of an object.\\n\\nIn the video below, CGMatter puts the tool to use to create the content to make a flipbook in Blender.\\n\\nAnimating a Flipbook for an Animation?? // Blender Tutorial - YouTube Watch On\\n\\nYou can get the Pencil Pro plugin from Superhive for $15.

       "  'content': \"Nvidia (NVDA) on Tuesday unveiled its new Rubin CPX GPU at the AI Infra Summit in Santa Clara, Calif.\\n\\nAccording to Nvidia, Rubin CPX is “purpose-built to handle million-token coding and generative video applications.”\\n\\nTokens are a unit of data in AI and can represent everything from words to pieces of video and audio. Every time you use a service like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok they break down your questions and requests into tokens to serve up an answer.\\n\\nThe Rubin CPX will work with the company’s Vera CPU and Rubin GPU as part of Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL 144 CPX platform. NVL 144 means that the system has 144 GPUs.\\n\\n“The Vera Rubin platform will mark another leap in the frontier of AI computing—introducing both the next-generation Rubin GPU and a new category of processors called CPX,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\\n\\n“Just as RTX revolutionized graphics and physical AI, Rubin CPX is the first CUDA GPU purpose-built for massive-context AI, where models reason across millions of tokens of knowledge at once.”\\n\\nAccording to Nvidia, the Vera Rubin NVL 144 CPX will offer 7.5x more AI performance than the company’s Grace Blackwell based BG300 NVL 72 system. That, the company says, will also help customers monetize their AI platforms with Nvidia estimating they could see $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested.\\n\\nAn image of Nvidia's Vera Rubin chip. (Image: Nvidia) · Nvidia\\n\\nThe Rubin CPX will be available at the end of 2026.\\n\\nShares of Nvidia are up 25% year-to-date and 63% over the last 12 months. The company reported better than anticipated earnings per share and revenue in Q2, but missed slightly on Data Center segment revenue.\\n\\nNvidia’s largest customers are cloud service providers, which make up roughly 50% of the company’s sales.\\n\\nThe chip giant is also working its way through resuming shipments of its H20 GPU to customers in China. President Trump initially banned the sale of the processor in April, but reversed course in July. He later announced that the US government would take a 15% cut of chip sales to the region.\\n\\nDuring a conversation with Yahoo Finance following the company’s earnings call, Huang said production of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips is “ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.”\\n\\nTrump, however, is also considering a 100% tariff on semiconductors, though he said that companies that build in the US will be exempt from the duty. While Nvidia doesn’t build chips on its own, it contracts with companies like TSMC (TSM), which is building new plants in the US.\\n\\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter. · yahoofinance\\n\\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

       "  'content': 'Things are, once again, all shake-up at Intel. After a new CEO, tons of layoffs, an increased focus on the Foundry side of the business, and other changes, Intel is sticking on-brand and making even more changes, this time to executive leadership. And while the biggest news for many might be that Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus is leaving, what\\'s particularly interesting is the company is starting a new group that will focus on a new custom silicon business.\\n\\nIn addition to these two things, Intel also announced that Jim Johnson will lead the Client Computing Group (CCG), Kevork Kechichian from Arm will join to lead Intel\\'s Data Center Group (DCG), and Intel Foundry CTOO Naga Chandrasekaran will also cover Foundry Services.\\n\\nThe custom silicon business that\\'s perhaps of most interest is to be headed up by senior VP and Fellow Srini Iyengar. Iyengar joined Intel earlier in the year after being a Fellow at Cadence Design Systems, which is of note because Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was previously CEO of Cadence until 2021.\\n\\nThe new group will apparently be looking towards serving external customers: \"Intel is also establishing a new Central Engineering Group led by Srinivasan (Srini) Iyengar, a senior vice president and Fellow. In his expanded role, Iyengar will lead horizontal engineering functions and build a new custom silicon business to serve a broad range of external customers.\"\\n\\nIf it pans it, this could certainly be a good move for Intel. Hearing the words \"custom silicon\" for \"external customers\" in 2025 triggers obvious thoughts of AI, as well as chasing down TSMC\\'s foundry dollar. Data centres are increasingly gobbling up AI workloads and thus far Nvidia has been the company to reap the bulk of the rewards from that.\\n\\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan conducting a keynote address. (Image credit: Intel)\\n\\nFrom his very first earnings call, Tan made it clear that Intel is going to look to cement itself in the AI market, although there\\'s been no definite word over what exactly that means. Now, there\\'s some reason to suppose that will mean custom AI silicon for data centers. Intel Foundry could certainly do with something of the sort to stake a bold new claim to after the past few years and especially months of troubled waters. But it really needs customers onboard.\\n\\nNo doubt extra incentive to push into Intel Foundry comes from the recent 10% buy-in from the US government, which is under the stipulation that Intel must own at least 51% of its Foundry for five years. In other words, there can be no back-up plan to scarper and sell.\\n\\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\\n\\nAs far as we\\'re concerned as PC gamers, it could be good news, too. Emphasis on \"could\" there, but a push into AI accelerators, for instance, would presumably give Intel a lot of R&D as well as actual GPU silicon to trickle down into its gaming division. Just like Nvidia with Blackwell and the RTX 50-series. Though I suppose that analogy should show us such a development might not necessarily spell any improvements for GPU prices.

       " {'headline': '(PR) NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra Sets the Bar in New MLPerf Inference Benchmark',\n",
       "  'content': \"Inference performance is critical, as it directly influences the economics of an AI factory. The higher the throughput of AI factory infrastructure, the more tokens it can produce at a high speed - increasing revenue, driving down total cost of ownership (TCO) and enhancing the system's overall productivity. Less than half a year since its debut at NVIDIA GTC, the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 rack-scale system - powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra architecture - set records on the new reasoning inference benchmark in MLPerf Inference v5.1, delivering up to 1.4x more DeepSeek-R1 inference throughput compared with NVIDIA Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 systems.Blackwell Ultra builds on the success of the Blackwell architecture, with the Blackwell Ultra architecture featuring 1.5x more NVFP4 AI compute and 2x more attention-layer acceleration than Blackwell, as well as up to 288 GB of HBM3e memory per GPU. The NVIDIA platform also set performance records on all new data center benchmarks added to the MLPerf Inference v5.1 suite - including DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.1 405B Interactive, Llama 3.1 8B and Whisper - while continuing to hold per-GPU records on every MLPerf data center benchmark.Full-stack co-design plays an important role in delivering these latest benchmark results. Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra incorporate hardware acceleration for the NVFP4 data format - an NVIDIA-designed 4-bit floating point format that provides better accuracy compared with other FP4 formats, as well as comparable accuracy to higher-precision formats.NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer software quantized DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.1 405B, Llama 2 70B and Llama 3.1 8B to NVFP4. In concert with the open-source NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library, this optimization enabled Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra to deliver higher performance while meeting strict accuracy requirements in submissions.Large language model inference consists of two workloads with distinct execution characteristics: 1) context for processing user input to produce the first output token and 2) generation to produce all subsequent output tokens.A technique called disaggregated serving splits context and generation tasks so each part can be optimized independently for best overall throughput. This technique was key to record-setting performance on the Llama 3.1 405B Interactive benchmark, helping to deliver a nearly 50% increase in performance per GPU with GB200 NVL72 systems compared with each Blackwell GPU in an NVIDIA DGX B200 server running the benchmark with traditional serving.NVIDIA also made its first submissions this round using the NVIDIA Dynamo inference framework.NVIDIA partners - including cloud service providers and server makers - submitted great results using the NVIDIA Blackwell and/or Hopper platform. These partners include Azure, Broadcom, Cisco, CoreWeave, Dell Technologies, Giga Computing, HPE, Lambda, Lenovo, Nebius, Oracle, Quanta Cloud Technology, Supermicro and the University of Florida.The market-leading inference performance on the NVIDIA AI platform is available from major cloud providers and server makers. This translates to lower TCO and enhanced return on investment for organizations deploying sophisticated AI applications.Learn more about these full-stack technologies by reading the NVIDIA Technical Blog on MLPerf Inference v5.1.

       " {'headline': 'NVIDIA Unveils \"Rubin CPX\" GPU: Single-Die, 30 PetaFLOPS, and 128 GB of GDDR7 Memory',\n",
       "  'content': 'During the AI Infra Summit, NVIDIA announced the \"Rubin CPX\" GPU, a specialized accelerator derived from the upcoming \"Rubin\" family, specifically made for massive-context AI models. The chip delivers 30 PetaFLOPS of NVFP4 compute performance on a monolithic die, accompanied by 128 GB of GDDR7 memory. The monolithic die configuration represents a departure from the dual-GPU packages characteristic of NVIDIA\\'s current Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra architectures, as well as the design path that the rest of the Rubin family will follow. The Rubin CPX addresses computational bottlenecks in extended-context scenarios where AI models process millions of tokens simultaneously. This capability proves critical for applications including comprehensive software codebase analysis and hour-long video content processing, which can require up to one million tokens.The processor integrates four NVENC and four NVDEC video encoders directly on-chip, enabling streamlined multimedia workflows without external processing dependencies. Performance metrics suggest that the Rubin CPX is delivering three times the attention processing speed of NVIDIA\\'s current best GB300 Blackwell Ultra accelerator systems. The architecture employs a cost-optimized single-die approach, rather than multi-chip modules, which potentially reduces manufacturing complexity while maintaining computational density. Memory bandwidth specifications remain undisclosed, though a 512-bit interface could yield approximately 1.8 TB/s throughput when using 30 Gbps GDDR7 memory chips. NVIDIA plans integration of Rubin CPX processors within the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX platform, which combines traditional Rubin GPUs with the specialized CPX variants. This hybrid configuration targets 8 ExaFLOPS of aggregate compute performance, with 1.7 PB/s of memory bandwidth, across a complete rack deployment. The \"Kyber\" rack will include ConnectX-9 network adapters capable of 1600G networking, Spectrum6 doing 102.4T switching, as well as co-packaged optics. NVIDIA plans this to arrive in late 2026, after the regular Rubin GPU launch in early 2026.NVIDIA pushes Rubin CPX as a one-off in the Rubin family to address the complexity of inferencing a test-time scaling AI system. As models evolve beyond simple text generation toward sophisticated reasoning systems, inference operations increasingly split between computationally intensive context processing and memory-bandwidth-dependent token generation phases. The CPX design optimizes for these dual requirements through its dedicated architecture, handling context prefill operations that can span enterprise chatbot sessions with 256,000 tokens or comprehensive code analysis exceeding 100,000 lines. This specialization becomes critical as AI systems transition from basic language models to multistep reasoning agents that maintain persistent memory across extended interactions. Hence, all of that needs to be enabled by hardware, and NVIDIA wants to make it a seamless experience for developers.',\n",

       " {'headline': \"Takeaways from AP's investigation into how US tech companies enabled China's digital police state\",\n",
       "  'content': 'BEIJING (AP) — Across China, tens of thousands of people tagged as troublemakers are trapped in a digital cage, barred from leaving their province and sometimes even their homes by the world’s largest digital surveillance apparatus. Most of this technology came from companies in a country that has long claimed to support freedoms worldwide: the United States.\\n\\nOver the past quarter century, American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warnings from the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.\\n\\nMost of the companies that responded said they fully complied with all laws, sanctions and U.S. export controls governing business in China, past and present. Here are key findings:\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAmerica brought ‘predicative policing’ to China\\n\\nU.S. companies introduced systems that mine a vast array of information — texts, calls, payments, flights, video, DNA swabs, mail deliveries, the internet, even water and power use — to unearth individuals deemed suspicious and predict their movements. But this technology also allows Chinese police to threaten friends and family and preemptively detain people for crimes they have not even committed. The AP found a Chinese defense contractor, Huadi, worked with IBM in 2009 to design the main policing system for Beijing to censor the internet and crack down on alleged terrorists, the Falun Gong religious sect, and even villagers deemed troublesome. IBM referred to any possible relationship it may have had with Chinese government agencies as “old, stale interactions”: “ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.” Huadi did not respond.\\n\\nUS tech enabled the Xinjiang crackdown\\n\\nAmerican surveillance technologies allowed a brutal mass detention campaign in the far west region of Xinjiang — targeting, tracking and grading virtually the entire native Uyghur population to forcibly assimilate and subdue them. IBM agents in China sold its i2 software to the Xinjiang police, China’s Ministry of State Security, and many other Chinese police units throughout the 2010s, leaked emails show. One agent, Landasoft, subsequently copied and deployed it as the basis for a predictive policing platform that tagged hundreds of thousands of people as potential terrorists. IBM said it has no record of its i2 software ever being sold to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang, was not aware of any interaction between Landasoft and that bureau and cut ties with Landasoft in 2014. Landasoft did not respond.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nSome tech companies even specifically addressed race in their marketing. Dell and a Chinese surveillance firm promoted a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop with “all-race recognition” on its official WeChat account in 2019. And until contacted by AP in August, biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific’s website marketed DNA kits to the Chinese police as “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans.” The Xinjiang government said that it uses surveillance technologies to prevent terrorism, and that Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.”\\n\\nCompanies pitched tech to control citizens\\n\\nThough the companies often claim they aren’t responsible for how their products are used, some directly pitched their tech as tools for Chinese police to control citizens, marketing materials from IBM, Dell, Cisco, and Seagate show. Their sales pitches — made both publicly and privately — cited Communist Party catchphrases on crushing protest, including “stability maintenance,” “key persons,” and “abnormal gatherings,” and named programs that stifle dissent, such as “Internet Police,” “Sharp Eyes” and the “Golden Shield.” IBM, Dell, Cisco and Seagate said they adhere to all relevant laws.\\n\\nAmerican tech laid the foundation for Chinese surveillance\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAmerican technology laid the foundation for China’s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced. Intel and Nvidia helped China’s three biggest surveillance companies make their camera systems AI-powered. Contracts to maintain existing IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft software and gear remain ubiquitous, often with third parties. And to this day, concerns remain over where technology sold to China will end up, with former U.S. officials and national security experts criticizing a deal struck this summer for Nvidia to sell chips used in artificial intelligence to China, saying the technology would fall into the hands of the Chinese military and intelligence. Nvidia said in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk, but told the AP those relationships no longer continue. Nvidia said it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed the H20 chips for police surveillance, and the White House and Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nBig loopholes in sanctions remain\\n\\nSome U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions. IBM said it has prohibited sales to Tibet and Xinjiang police since 2015, and suspended business relations with defense contractor Huadi in 2019. Nvidia and Intel also ended partnerships with China’s top two surveillance companies in 2019. However, sanctions experts noted that the laws have significant loopholes and often lag behind new developments. For example, a ban on military and policing gear to China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre does not take into account newer technologies or general-use products that can be applied in policing. They also noted that the law around export controls is complicated.\\n\\nA cautionary tale\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nWhat started in China more than a decade ago could be seen as a cautionary tale for other countries at a time when the use of surveillance technology worldwide is rising sharply, including in the United States. Emboldened by the Trump administration, U.S. tech companies are more powerful than ever, and President Donald Trump has rolled back a Biden-era executive order meant to safeguard civil rights from new surveillance technologies. As the capacity and sophistication of such technologies has grown, so has their reach. Surveillance technologies now include AI systems that help track and detain migrants in the U.S. and identify people to kill in the Israel-Hamas war. China, in the meantime, has used what it learned from the U.S. to turn itself into a surveillance superpower, selling technologies to countries like Iran and Russia.\\n\\n“Because of this technology … we have no freedom at all,” said Yang Caiying, now in exile in Japan, whose family has been trapped in an increasingly tight noose of surveillance for the past 16 years. “At the moment, it’s us Chinese that are suffering the consequences, but sooner or later, Americans and others, too, will lose their freedoms.”\\n\\n__\\n\\nYael Grauer is an independent investigative tech reporter.

       " {'headline': '(PR) NVIDIA RTX Remix Update Introduces Advanced Path-Traced Particle System',\n",
       "  'content': 'Many classic PC games remain beloved for their unforgettable stories, characters, and gameplay. But as technology advances, their visuals struggle to keep up, making it harder for the original gamers who played them, or new generations, to appreciate their magic. NVIDIA RTX Remix, a modding platform for RTX AI PCs, was built to change that. By reimagining the graphics of these timeless classics with cutting-edge path tracing, we\\'re allowing longtime fans to relive their favorite adventures in stunning detail, while introducing a new wave of players to the games that defined an era.Today, we\\'ve released a new RTX Remix update through NVIDIA app, adding an advanced particle system that enables modders to enhance traditional fire and smoke effects, as well as more fantastical effects, like those in Portal. Check out our official documentation to see the full release notes.In RTX Remix, legacy particles from a classic game could be interpreted as path-traced, enabling them to cast realistic light, enhancing the appearance of many scenes. But ultimately, these particles were still over 20 years old, lacking detail, flair, and fluid animations.Now, modders can create brand new particles in Remix that match the look of those found in modern titles. This opens the door for over 165 RTX Remix compatible games to have advanced particle effects for the first time, and we can\\'t wait to see all the ways modders dazzle gamers with realistic and spectacular effects.RTX Remix particles are GPU-driven, meaning you can add tens of thousands of them without significantly reducing performance. They are path-traced, meaning they cast accurate shadows, and are reflected in the world-a rarity in games. Additionally, they feature a realistic physics simulation, complete with proper collisions with the environment. All of these elements together give modders a chance to make breathtaking VFX. As an example, we\\'ve designated the Antlion Guard from Half-Life 2 RTX as a particle emitter. Over 100,000 shadowed particles are performantly rendered, and as the Antlion Guard moves, the physics of each particle is accurately reflected and affected.In the clip below, you can see how the fire in Half-Life 2 RTX can be elevated to look more natural and realistic through the use of advanced particles, with smoke billowing from the tips, and embers sparking and floating through the air:These effects can be tuned dramatically, giving modders many ways to channel their creativity. For example, here are three vastly different interpretations of the high energy pellet from Portal with RTX:And best of all, RTX Remix lets you add particles into your scene instantly while you play - it\\'s instantaneous and a whole lot of fun.Adding RTX Remix particles is fast and easy. Simply open the Alt+X RTX Remix Developer Menu while in-game, navigate to the Games Setup > Categorize Textures tab, and select any game element, be that a fire effect, character, or malfunctioning light-from there, simply select \"particle emitters\" to see particles spawn. On the \"Rendering tab\", adjust the size of the effect, the number of particles spawned, the color, and other fields to achieve the perfect look - it\\'s as easy as that!For more serious modders, we recommend building your particles in the RTX Remix Toolkit, which offers a lot more control. For a complete breakdown of all the new particle options, check out the release notes, and head over to the RTX Remix developer manual.Since its initial release, the RTX Remix modding community has grown to 237 active projects, with over 100 RTX Remix mods released. They span a catalog of beloved games like Half-Life 2, Need for Speed Underground,Portal 2 and Deus Ex, boasting over 2 million downloads.Recently, we asked the community to make new mods and enhance their existing work in our RTX Remix Mod Contest. The mods created were phenomenal, and ultimately we awarded $60,000 in cash prizes to the developers of Painkiller RTX Remix, Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines - RTX Remaster, I-Ninja Remixed, and Call of Duty 2 RTX Remix of Carentan. Head to our contest article to learn more, and to download the mods.As a modder plays through a classic game with RTX Remix, textures, models, lighting, effects, and more can all be captured, and reassembled into an editable scene. Through an intuitive interface, the RTX Remix application lets modders drag and drop lights, recreate every object and material to modern standards, copy-paste existing objects into a scene to increase clutter and grass coverage, convert lights to be fully ray-traced, AI enhance textures, and add DLSS 4 to improve image quality and accelerate performance.To make your own RTX mods, download NVIDIA RTX Remix from the Home screen of NVIDIA app. And grab the Half-Life 2 RTX demo or Portal with RTX from Steam for an example of what\\'s possible with the latest RTX Remix upgrades.NVIDIA RTX Remix requires a GeForce RTX GPU to create RTX Remix Mods, while mods and games built using Remix are compatible with any hardware that can run Vulkan ray-traced games.To find RTX Remix mods to download and play, we recommend ModDB and the RTX Remix Showcase Discord server.',\n",

       " {'headline': 'Intel Arc B770 \"Battlemage\" Nears Launch as Intel Prepares Packaging',\n",
       "  'content': 'Intel plans to complete its Arc \"Battlemage\" lineup with the highest-performing B770 SKU. Thanks to @Haze2K1 on X, we found shipping manifests dated June 11, 2025, which list BMG-G31 GPU dies packed in boxes with dimensions matching those used before the Arc B580 launch. Last time with B580, the launch happened 2.5 months after these shipping manifests appeared. The current rumor mill suggests that the card will utilize 32 Xe2 cores with 16 GB of memory on a 256-bit bus, providing it with a clear capacity edge over many 8 GB rivals from AMD and NVIDIA, like the RTX 5060 Ti and RX 9060. The BMG-G31 die is bigger than the BMG-G21 used in the B580, B570, and Arc Pro parts, which explains the larger crates. Extra silicon could enable higher clocks, stronger ray tracing, and a wider memory interface, though thermal management and power draw will matter. Early samples and firmware checks will set the final timing and availability soon.Timing will determine how much impact the Arc B770 can have, because AMD and NVIDIA already control much of the upper mid-range and high-end segments. NVIDIA \"SUPER\" refreshes of the current \"Blackwell\" only raise the pressure on Intel to be both performance competitive and well priced. Battlemage has already shifted pricing expectations in the market before, compelling rivals to rethink memory configurations and price points. Intel has also shown steady improvement in its driver updates and software support, which has narrowed historical gaps in user experience. Rumors pointing to a Q4 2025 debut would put the card into the usual holiday buying window, but to convert gamer\\'s interest into real market share, Intel will need an aggressive pricing strategy and solid supply.',\n",

They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warningsfrom the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.\\n\\nThe AP investigation was based on tens of thousands of leaked emails and databases from a Chinese surveillance company; thousands of pages of confidential corporate and government documents; public Chinese language marketing material; and thousands of procurements, many provided by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the non-profit Asia Society. The AP also drew from dozens of open record requests and interviews with more than 100 current and former Chinese and American engineers, executives, experts, officials, administrators, and police officers.\\n\\nAmerican tech firms were by far the biggest suppliers, but German, Japanese, and Korean firms also had a role. Here are some examples:\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nMILITARY ACCESS: A Chinese military contractor worked with Armonk, New York-based IBM in 2009 to design national intelligence systems, including a counterterrorism system, according to classified Chinese government documents. These systems were used by China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security, and the Chinese military. IBM referred to any such deals as “old, stale interactions”: “ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.”\\n\\nANTI-TERROR ANALYSIS: IBM agents in China sold IBM’s i2 policing analysis software to the Xinjiang police, China’s Ministry of State Security, and other Chinese police units throughout the 2010s, leaked emails show. i2 software was subsequently copied and deployed by one former IBM agent, Landasoft, as the basis for a predictive policing platform that tagged hundreds of thousands of people as potential terrorists during a brutal crackdown in China’s far west Xinjiang region. IBM says it ceased relations with Landasoft in 2014, prohibited sales to police in Xinjiang and Tibet since 2015, and has no record of any sales of i2 software to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.\\n\\nETHNIC REPRESSION: Dell and then-subsidiary VMWare sold cloud software and storage devices to police and entities providing data to police in Tibet and Xinjiang, even as late as 2022 after ethnic repression there was widely known. Dell addressed race in its marketing: In 2019, Dell said on WeChat it had teamed up with surveillance firm Yitu to sell a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop for Chinese police with “all-race recognition.” Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, told AP it conducts “rigorous due diligence” to ensure compliance with U.S. export controls. Chinese policing systems, including in Xinjiang, also used software from Oracle, based in Austin, Texas, and from Microsoft, based in Seattle, according to procurements and a leaked database obtained by AP.\\n\\nFINGERPRINT RECOGNITION: Chinese defense contractor Huadi worked with IBM to construct China’s national fingerprint database; IBM said it never sold “fingerprinting-specific” products to the Chinese government and that any possible misuse “for fingerprinting purposes” was done without its knowledge or assistance. HP and VMWare sold technology used for fingerprint comparison by Chinese police. Intel said in 2019 marketing material that it partnered with Hisign, a Chinese fingerprinting company that sold to Xinjiang police, to make their fingerprint readers more effective, and that the new reader was “fully tested in an actual application scenario” with a municipal police bureau. Hisign was still an Intel partner as of last year, according to Chinese media reports. California-based Intel said it has not had any technical engagement with Hisign since 2024, and told AP it would “act swiftly” if it became aware of any “credible misuse.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAI CAMERAS: IBM, Dell, Tokyo-based Hitachi, and VMWare promoted facial recognition for use by Chinese police. Japanese electronics giant Sony said on its official WeChat account that it wired a Chinese prison with “intelligent” cameras, saying it was widely trusted for “surveillance projects.” California chip giant Nvidia and Intel partnered with China’s three biggest surveillance companies to add AI capabilities to camera systems used for video surveillance across China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet, until sanctions were imposed. Relations with other Chinese surveillance companies continued more recently: Nvidia posted on its WeChat social media account in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk. Nvidia told AP those relationships no longer continue.\\n\\nSURVEILLANCE RESEARCH: Nvidia, IBM, and Hitachi staff collaborated with Chinese police researchers and companies on surveillance technology. Nvidia said in a post dating to 2013 or later that a Chinese police institute used its chips for surveillance technology research. Nvidia said it doesn’t currently work with Chinese police but did not address the past. And in 2021, an IBM and a U.S. Army researcher coauthored an AI video study with a Chinese police researcher working at a sanctioned company, according to a paper unearthed by IPVM, a surveillance research publication. The U.S. Army told AP the Chinese police researcher only worked on the paper after the Army researcher’s work had concluded.\\n\\nDNA: Chinese police DNA labs bought Dell and Microsoft software and equipment to save genetic data on police databases. In 2021, Hitachi advertised DNA sequencers to Chinese police, and police labs bought pipettes from German biotech firm Eppendorf last year. And until contacted by AP in August, Massachusetts-based biotech firm Thermo Fisher Scientific‘s website stated that its kits are made for China’s national DNA database and “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans,” and featured the work of a Chinese police researcher who discussed using Thermo Fisher kits to identify ethnic Uyghur and Manchu populations at a 2016 conference. Thermo Fisher stopped sales in Xinjiang in 2021 and in Tibet in 2024, but still promotes kits to police elsewhere in China, including at a police trade show earlier this year. In a statement to AP, Thermo Fisher said its kits “are designed to be effective across diverse global populations” but “do not have the capability to distinguish among specific ethnic groups.”\\n\\nINTERNET POLICE: In 2014, VMWare said internet police in cities across China used its software, and in 2016, Dell said on its WeChat account that its services assisted the Chinese internet police in “cracking down on rumormongers” — essentially promoting censorship. An undated IBM marketing presentation said that internet police in Shanghai and Guangzhou used its i2 software, with metadata suggesting it was from 2018. IBM held a conference in Beijing promoting i2 in 2018, according to its official WeChat account.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY: Leaked government blueprints show Illinois-based Motorola provided encrypted radio communications technology to the Chinese police for handling “sudden and mass events in Beijing.” Motorola did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nAI DRIVES: Californian hard disk giants Seagate and Western Digital and Tokyo-based Toshiba sell hard drives specialized for AI video systems for use by Chinese police. In 2022, Toshiba wrote about how its surveillance hard drives can help police monitor communities to “identify and control suspicious” or “blacklisted” individuals. “They’re optimized and adapted for security systems,” Toshiba sales director Feng Hao told AP. Last year, Western Digital touted its partnership with Chinese surveillance company Uniview at a policing trade expo, months before Uniview was sanctioned over complicity in rights abuses. And Seagate said on WeChat in 2022 that it sells hard drives “tailor made” for AI video systems in China for use by police to help them ”control key persons,” and promoted their drives to police at a security trade association in China this year.\\n\\nMAPPING SOFTWARE: Blueprints show that in 2009, IBM, Oracle, and Esri, the creator of ArcGIS based in California, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of software to build China’s Police Geographic Information System, and in 2013, HP said it sold “digital fencing” solutions to Chinese police. Such systems alert Chinese police even today when Uyghurs, Tibetans or dissidents stray out of provinces, counties or even villages. The U.S. curbed exports of such mapping software to China in 2020. But the restrictions are narrow in scope, and Esri maintains a research center in Beijing that marketed to police and other Chinese clients. Esri denied involvement.\\n\\nPOLICE GEAR: Chinese police patrol the streets equipped with foreign technology. Officers stroll the streets of Beijing with Motorola walkie-talkies, for example, while Korean electronics giant Samsung sells microSD cards for police body cameras, advertising them at Chinese police trade shows in 2023 and 2024. And in WeChat posts, Chinese state-owned company Jinghua said it cooperated with German electronics giant Philips on China’s first ”AI-powered 5G” police body camera and advertised Philips-branded recorders and cameras to Chinese police. In a statement, Philips said it had no partnership with Jinghua, did not authorize sales of Philips-branded body cameras in China, and would be contacting Jinghua over the posts.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nIBM, Dell, California network seller Cisco, Seattle-based Amazon Web Services, Seagate, Intel, Thermo Fisher and Western Digital all said they adhere to relevant export controls, laws and regulations where they operate.

       "  'content': 'AI agents are here — and they could be a blessing and a curse.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the classic double-edged sword of technology,\" SailPoint (SAIL) CEO Mark McClain told Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at Goldman Sachs\\' Communacopia + Technology Conference.\\n\\n\"People are rapidly wanting to deploy agents as a way to enhance the productivity, effectiveness, efficiency ... on their business. But they\\'re increasingly cognizant of the risk,\" he said.\\n\\nThe risk comes down to visibility and control. While AI-driven agents can automate workflows and even generate subagents, they raise questions about accountability.\\n\\n\"You have to always ensure that there\\'s some person in the organization that\\'s taking responsibility for that [agent],\" McClain said.\\n\\nMcClain\\'s comments come as SailPoint, an identity security developer, works to position itself at the center of the AI wave. It specializes in securing machine identities and managing access for companies like Home Depot (HD).\\n\\nThe company recently raised its full-year outlook despite short-term stock pressure tied to its third quarter guidance. SailPoint stock was down over 8% during Tuesday afternoon trading. Year to date, shares have fallen 7%.\\n\\nMcClain noted that SailPoint is working in tandem with firms like CrowdStrike (CRWD), calling the company \"complementary to us,\" as it focuses on device-level security.\\n\\nHowever, McClain downplayed the idea that automation will replace entire workforces. \"I think they\\'re going to leverage this technology to make their people better and more effective, far more than they\\'re going to just replace people,\" he said.\\n\\nSailPoint began trading on Feb. 13 on the Nasdaq. The company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top end of its targeted range of $21 to $23, raising $1.38 billion in proceeds.\\n\\nThe stock closed its first day of trading at $22 per share and hit a closing high of $25.70 on Feb. 16. It was the first big test of the tech IPO market in 2025. Since then, several other buzzy IPOs came to market, including Nvidia (NVDA) chip consumer CoreWeave (CRWV), trading platform eToro (ETOR), and software play Figma (FIG).\\n\\n\"We see an opportunity with SAIL to own a best-of-breed vendor at a discount as Identity continues to move up the priority stack. We have seen significant share shift across the Identity landscape in the wake of an \\'identity crisis\\' legacy vendors face as they have not efficiently invested in their platforms to address Identity related risk that is poised to accelerate,\" JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex wrote in a note.',\n",

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the major analyst calls.\\n\\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein senior U.S. semiconductor analyst, said in a CNBC program in May that AI demand is “off the charts” and CapEx is not slowing as it was feared. Rasgon liked Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) amid the company’s AI and software exposure:\\n\\n“Look, I’ve liked the AI names. I felt that whereas for a lot of these other end markets people were really worried about what’s going to happen in the second half and whether demand is real or not, AI demand is real. I also think the AI hardware, if tariffs are implemented, is somewhat insulated because most of the AI servers come into the U.S. through Mexico — they’re USMCA-compliant and tariff-free. So I actually like AI. I like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)— it has an AI story, and they’ve also got 40% of their revenue from software, which is safe. Their non-AI semis were already at a cyclical low.”\\n\\nAVGO is up 80% over the past six months. For the fiscal fourth quarter, AVGO expects $6.2 billion in AI revenue, up 66% from a year earlier. The company said it secured $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer. Many analysts believe this customer is OpenAI.

       " {'headline': 'US tech companies enabled the surveillance and detention of hundreds of thousands in China',\n",
       "  'content': \"BEIJING (AP) — The body camera hung from the top of the IV drip, recording the slightest twitch made by Yang Guoliang as he lay bloody and paralyzed in a hospital bed after a police beating with bricks.\\n\\nBy then, surveillance was nothing new for the Yang family in rural China, snared in an intricate network based on U.S. technology that spies on them and predicts what they’ll do.\\n\\nTheir train tickets, hotel bookings, purchases, text messages and phone calls are forwarded to the government. Their house is ringed with more than a dozen cameras. They’ve tried to go to Beijing 20 times in the past few years, but masked men show up and grab them, often before they depart. And last year, Yang’s wife and younger daughter were detained and now face trial for disrupting the work of the Chinese state — a crime carrying a sentence of up to a decade in prison.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nYet the Yangs say they are not criminals. They are simply farmers trying to beg Beijing to stop local officials from seizing their 1 1/2 acres of land in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.\\n\\n“Every move in my own home is monitored,” Yang said, sitting behind black curtains that block him from the glare of police lights trained straight at his house. “Their surveillance makes me feel unsafe all the time, everywhere.”\\n\\nAcross China, tens of thousands of people tagged as troublemakers like the Yangs are trapped in a digital cage, barred from leaving their province and sometimes even their homes by the world’s largest digital surveillance apparatus. Most of this technology came from companies in a country that has long claimed to support freedoms worldwide: the United States.\\n\\nOver the past quarter century, American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warningsfrom the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nCritically, American surveillance technologies allowed a brutal mass detention campaign in the far west region of Xinjiang — targeting, tracking and grading virtually the entire native Uyghur population to forcibly assimilate and subdue them.\\n\\nU.S. companies did this by bringing “predictive policing” to China — technology that sucks in and analyzes data to prevent crime, protests, or terror attacks before they happen. Such systems mine a vast array of information — texts, calls, payments, flights, video, DNA swabs, mail deliveries, the internet, even water and power use — to unearth individuals deemed suspicious and predict their behavior. But they also allow Chinese police to threaten friends and family and preemptively detain people for crimes they have not even committed.\\n\\nFor example, the AP found a Chinese defense contractor, Huadi, worked with IBM to design the main policing system known as the “Golden Shield” for Beijing to censor the internet and crack down on alleged terrorists, the Falun Gong religious sect, and even villagers deemed troublesome, according to thousands of pages of classified government blueprints taken out of China by a whistleblower, verified by AP and revealed here for the first time. IBM and other companies that responded said they fully complied with all laws, sanctions and U.S. export controls governing business in China, past and present.\\n\\nAcross China, surveillance systems track blacklisted “key persons,” whose movements are restricted and monitored. In Xinjiang, administrators logged people as high, medium, or low risk, often according to 100-point scores with deductions for factors like growing a beard, being 15 to 55 years old, or just being Uyghur.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nSome tech companies even specifically addressed race in their marketing. Dell and a Chinese surveillance firm promoted a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop with “all-race recognition” on Dell's official WeChat account in 2019. And until contacted by AP in August, biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific’s website marketed DNA kits to the Chinese police as “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans.”\\n\\nWhile the flood of American technology slowed considerably starting in 2019 after outrage and sanctions over atrocities in Xinjiang, it laid the foundation for China’s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced. To this day, concerns remain over where technology sold to China will end up.\\n\\nFor example, 20 former U.S. officials and national security experts wrote a letter in late July criticizing a deal for Nvidia to sell H20 chips used in artificial intelligence to China, with 15% of revenues going to the U.S. government. They said no matter who the chip is sold to, it will fall into the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.\\n\\nNvidia said it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed the H20 for police surveillance. Nvidia posted on its WeChat social media account in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk, but told the AP those relationships no longer continue. The White House and Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nThermo Fisher and hard drive maker Seagate promoted their products to Chinese police at conferences and trade shows this year, according to online posts. Officers stroll the streets of Beijing with Motorola walkie talkies. Nvidia and Intel chips remain critical for Chinese policing systems, procurements show. And contracts to maintain existing IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft software and gear remain ubiquitous, often with third parties.\\n\\nWhat started in China more than a decade ago could be seen as a cautionary tale for other countries at a time when the use of surveillance technology worldwide is rising sharply, including in the United States. Emboldened by the Trump administration, U.S. tech companies are more powerful than ever, and President Donald Trump has rolled back a Biden-era executive order meant to safeguard civil rights from new surveillance technologies.\\n\\nAs the capacity and sophistication of such technologies has grown, so has their reach. Surveillance technologies now include AI systems that help track and detain migrants in the U.S. and identify people to kill in the Israel-Hamas war. China, in the meantime, has used what it learned from the U.S. to turn itself into a surveillance superpower, selling technologies to countries like Iran and Russia.\\n\\nThe AP investigation was based on tens of thousands of leaked emails and databases from a Chinese surveillance company; tens of thousands of pages of confidential corporate and government documents; public Chinese language marketing material; and thousands of procurements, many provided by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the non-profit Asia Society. The AP also drew from dozens of open record requests and interviews with more than 100 current and former Chinese and American engineers, executives, experts, officials, administrators, and police officers.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nThough the companies often claim they aren’t responsible for how their products are used, some directly pitched their tech as tools for Chinese police to control citizens, marketing material from IBM, Dell, Cisco, and Seagate show. Their sales pitches — made both publicly and privately — cited Communist Party catchphrases on crushing protest, including “stability maintenance,” “key persons,” and “abnormal gatherings,” and named programs that stifle dissent, such as “Internet Police,” “Sharp Eyes” and the “Golden Shield.”\\n\\nOther companies, like Intel, Nvidia, Oracle, Thermo Fisher, Motorola, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Western Digital, creator of mapping software ArcGIS Esri, and what was then Hewlett Packard, or HP, also sold technology or services knowingly to Chinese police or surveillance companies. Four practicing lawyers said sales like those uncovered by AP could potentially go against at least the spirit, if not the letter, of U.S. export laws at the time, which the companies denied.\\n\\nAmerican technology made up nearly every part of China’s surveillance apparatus, AP found:\\n\\nMILITARY AND POLICE: In 2009, Chinese defense contractor Huadi worked with IBM to build national intelligence systems, including a counterterrorism system, used by the Chinese military and China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security. Chinese agents sold IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to the same ministry and to Chinese police, including in Xinjiang, through the 2010s, leaked emails and marketing posts show. IBM said it has no record of its i2 software ever having been sold to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nSURVEILLANCE: Nvidia and Intel partnered with China’s three biggest surveillance companies to add AI capabilities to camera systems used for video surveillance across China, including Xinjiang and Tibet, until sanctions were imposed. Nvidia said in a post dating to 2013 or later that a Chinese police institute used its chips for surveillance technology research.\\n\\nETHNIC REPRESSION: IBM, Oracle, HP, and ArcGIS developer Esri sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of geographic and mapping software to Chinese police that allows officers to detect when blacklisted Uyghurs, Tibetans or dissidents stray out of provinces or villages. As late as 2019, with detentions in Xinjiang well underway, Dell hosted an industry summit in its capital. Dell and then-subsidiary VMWare sold cloud software and storage devices to police and entities providing data to police in Tibet and Xinjiang, even in 2022 after abuses there became widely known.\\n\\nIDENTIFICATION: Huadi worked with IBM to construct China’s national fingerprint database; IBM told AP it never sold “fingerprinting-specific product or technology” to the Chinese government “in violation of US law.” HP and VMWare sold technology used for fingerprint comparison by Chinese police, while Intel partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company to make their devices more effective. IBM, Dell, and VMWare also promoted facial recognition to Chinese police. China’s police and police DNA labs bought Dell and Microsoft software and equipment to save genetic data on police databases.\\n\\nCENSORSHIP AND CONTROL: In 2016, Dell boasted on its WeChat account that its services assisted the Chinese internet police in “cracking down on rumormongers.” Seagate said on WeChat in 2022 that it sells hard drives “tailor made” for AI video systems in China for use by police to help them ”control key persons,” despite facing backlash for selling drives in Xinjiang.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nFor extended findings, click here.\\n\\n“Everything was built on American tech,” said Valentin Weber, a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations who studied the use of U.S. tech by Chinese police. “China’s capability was close to zero.”\\n\\nIBM, Dell, Cisco, Intel, Thermo Fisher and Amazon Web Services all said they adhere to export control policies. Seagate and Western Digital said they adhere to all relevant laws and regulations where they operate.\\n\\nOracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and tech conglomerate Broadcom, which acquired VMWare and cloud company Pivotal in 2023, did not comment on the record; HP, Motorola and Huadi did not respond, and Esri denied involvement but did not reply to examples. Microsoft told AP it found no evidence that it “knowingly sold technology to the military or police” as part of updates to the “Golden Shield.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nSome U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions. For example, IBM said it has prohibited sales to Tibet and Xinjiang police since 2015, and suspended business relations with defense contractor Huadi in 2019.\\n\\nHowever, sanctions experts noted that the laws have significant loopholes and often lag behind new developments. For example, a ban on military and policing gear to China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre does not take into account newer technologies or general-use products that can be applied in policing.\\n\\nThey also noted that the law around export controls is complicated. Raj Bhala, an expert in international trade law at the University of Kansas, said the issues the AP described fell into “the kind of gray area that we put in exams.”\\n\\n“It would raise concerns about possible inconsistencies, possible violations,” said Bhala, who emphasized he was speaking generally and not about any specific company. “But I really stress ‘possible.’ We need to know more facts.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nWhile German, Japanese and Korean firms also played a role, American tech firms were by far the biggest suppliers.\\n\\nThe Xinjiang government said in a statement that it uses surveillance technologies to “prevent and combat terrorist and criminal activity,” that it respects citizens’ privacy and legal rights and that it does not target any particular ethnicity. The statement said Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.” Other government agencies did not respond to a request for comment, including China’s police and authorities in the Yangs’ province.\\n\\nThis technology still powers the police database that controls the Yangs and other ordinary people. An estimate based on Chinese government statistics found at least 55,000 to 110,000 were put under residential surveillance in the past decade, and vast numbers are restricted from travel in Xinjiang and Tibet. China’s cities, roads and villages are now studded with more cameras than the rest of the world combined, analysts say — one for every two people.\\n\\n“Because of this technology … we have no freedom at all,” said Yang Guoliang’s elder daughter, Yang Caiying, now in exile in Japan. “At the moment, it’s us Chinese that are suffering the consequences, but sooner or later, Americans and others, too, will lose their freedoms.”\\n\\nSelling surveillance superpowers\\n\\nBack when China was emerging from the chaotic violence of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, three in four Chinese were farmers, including the Yangs. They lived in a three-room home of tiles and pounded earth nestled among the lush, humid fields of the Yangtze River delta.\\n\\nAfter Chairman Mao Zedong’s death that year, Beijing’s new leaders opened China to the world, and American tech firms like HP and IBM rushed in. But there were hard limits on how much change the government would accept. In 1989, the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests rattled Beijing, which sent tanks and troops to shoot students.\\n\\nSoon after, Beijing began planning the “Golden Shield,” aimed at digitizing China’s police force.\\n\\nIn 2001, the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks turbocharged interest in surveillance technology. One researcher claimed authorities could have foiled the attack by unearthing connections between hijackers through public information in databases.\\n\\nAmerican companies cashed in, selling the U.S. billions of dollars in surveillance technologies they said could prevent crime and terror attacks.\\n\\nThey spotted the same sales opportunity in China. Researchers warned surveillance technologies would be “instruments of repression” in the hands of authoritarian states. Yet IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and other American companies clinched orders to supply Beijing’s “Golden Shield.”\\n\\n“China didn’t have this kind of thing before,” said Wang, a former Chinese police official in Xinjiang who asked to be identified only by last name for fear of retaliation. “These concepts all came from the West.”\\n\\nSoon, disturbing stories emerged. Chinese police blocked sensitive news, pinpointing dissidents with unnerving precision. They stalked adherents of the Falun Gong sect banned by authorities. Congress demanded explanations from tech companies.\\n\\nIn 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web. Followers sued Cisco, which is now petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out the lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit.\\n\\nAt a human rights conference in February, then-Cisco lawyer Katie Shay said companies had a responsibility to understand how customers might misuse their technology for “surveillance and censorship.”\\n\\n“A lot of people have suffered at the hands of their government, and I want to acknowledge that pain,” said Shay, who left Cisco in June. “I also will say that Cisco disputes the allegations of Cisco’s involvement.”\\n\\nCisco told the AP it is committed to human rights, but the court allegations may “open the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services.”\\n\\nAs Cisco was summoned before Congress, IBM partnered with a Chinese defense contractor on Phase Two of China’s “Golden Shield.”\\n\\nClassified government blueprints obtained by AP show that in 2009, IBM worked with Huadi, the state-owned subsidiary of China’s biggest missile military contractor spun off from China’s Ministry of Defense, to build out predictive policing.\\n\\n“Consolidate Communist Party rule,” read the Huadi blueprint, which showed the databases would track hundreds of thousands of people online.\\n\\nIn response to AP’s questions, IBM referred to any possible relationship it may have had with Chinese government agencies as “old, stale interactions”:\\n\\n“ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.”\\n\\nBack in 2009, Beijing needed the technology urgently to quash critics bonding online. Among them were the Yangs.\\n\\nIn April that year, local authorities ordered the Yangs and more than 300 other families in their village off their land. Developers coveted their prime lakefront property for “Western-style” apartments and villas, with fountains, football fields and shopping centers.\\n\\nThe Yangs had no idea police were installing systems that could target families like theirs. They just knew their land was being seized — in return for just a unit in a five-floor walk-up, too many stairs for their elderly mother to climb.\\n\\nThe Yangs and other farmers across China filed complaints.\\n\\n“I discovered the way the government took our land was illegal,” Yang Caiying said. “They cheated us.”\\n\\nPredict and prevent\\n\\nIn July 2009, three months after the Yang land was seized, riots erupted on the other side of the country in Xinjiang. Gory images of a Uyghur lynched at a toy factory spread online, angry Uyghurs took to the streets, and hundreds were killed.\\n\\nOnce again, American firms pitched their technology as the solution.\\n\\nThe government sent troops and cut Xinjiang’s phone and internet connections. In secret meetings, officials concluded that police had failed to spot the danger signs because they couldn’t identify Uyghurs deemed separatists, terrorists, and religious extremists, three engineers then working for the Xinjiang government told AP.\\n\\nAt the time, Xinjiang police and data systems were already running on American technology including IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft, the engineers said, which AP verified by reviewing government contracts. But the databases were unconnected.\\n\\nSo Xinjiang launched an ambitious initiative to fuse data from all available sources, including banks, railways, and phone companies, into a central database. Officials demanded complete information on all suspicious individuals and their relatives going back three generations, according to the engineers, who described specific meetings in which they participated. Two asked to remain anonymous, fearing for their family in China; the third, Nureli Abliz, is now in Germany.\\n\\nSoon, lucrative contracts went up for bidding. Among those seeking to profit was IBM.\\n\\n“Prevent problems before they happen,” IBM promised Chinese officials. In an August 2009 pamphlet, IBM cited the Xinjiang riots and said its technology could help the government “ensure urban safety and stability.”\\n\\nIBM executives fanned out across the country to court Chinese officials. In December 2009, they set up a new “IBM Institute for Electronic Governance Innovation” in Beijing. In 2011, IBM acquired i2, a software program designed to prevent “terrorist threats.” IBM touted i2’s ability to analyze Chinese social media and licensed a Shanghai-based firm called Landasoft to sell it to China’s police, corporate records show.\\n\\nChinese police purchased tens of millions of dollars’ worth of products from companies like IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft to upgrade the “Golden Shield” policing systems, a leaked accounting ledger acquired by AP from a whistleblower shows.\\n\\nIn the confrontation between the Chinese state and its critics, American technology tipped the scales of power.\\n\\nIn 2011, thieves ransacked the Yangs’ house, hunting for their property deed. They didn’t find it.\\n\\nTwo years later, bald men with tattoos and gold chains smashed down their door, shattered windows and flipped furniture to bully them out of their home anyway. Yang’s mother dropped to the floor in terror. Doctors diagnosed a heart attack, but the Yangs didn’t have money for a pacemaker.\\n\\nFurious, the Yangs sued local police. In June 2015, a judge ruled their land had been seized illegally. The Yangs celebrated.\\n\\nBut just weeks after the ruling, officers identified human rights lawyers through the “Golden Shield” technology, cuffed hundreds of them and pressed them into police vans across China. One lawyer later recalled how police monitored his messages on human rights in WeChat before they grabbed him, shackled him to a chair, and tortured him.\\n\\nOvernight, China’s budding rights-defense movement was dealt a fatal blow — and with it, the Yangs’ case. The Yangs were called in and curtly told the judgment was being overturned, their lawsuit dismissed without trial.\\n\\n“We really had too much faith in the law, you know?” Yang Guoliang said, his hands clenched in fists. “It turned out to be worthless.”\\n\\nTechnologies of terror\\n\\nIn the meantime, Beijing was transforming Xinjiang into the most heavily surveilled place on earth, sweeping around a million people into camps and prisons.\\n\\nWhen bombs tore through a train station in Xinjiang’s capital hours after a visit by leader Xi Jinping in 2014, Xi demanded a crackdown.\\n\\n“He was super angry,” said Abliz, one of the engineers with the Xinjiang government. “They concluded they weren’t surveilling Uyghurs closely enough.”\\n\\nThe next year, in April 2015, Abliz attended a closed-door exposition in Xinjiang. A booth ran by Landasoft, the former IBM partner, caught his eye.\\n\\nAfter years as a vendor of IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to Xinjiang police, Landasoft had struck out on its own, touting i2-like software it said could detain extremists before they caused trouble. The similarity was no coincidence: Landasoft’s software was copied from i2, according to leaked emails and records.\\n\\n“The platform is developed based on i2,” a Landasoft project manager wrote in an email.\\n\\nIt used a proprietary data visualization system developed by i2. The software powered what was called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, or IJOP, with the authority to trigger arrests.\\n\\nAbliz went numb.\\n\\n“I thought then that this was the end of humanity,” he said.\\n\\nLandasoft did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IBM said it cut ties with Landasoft in 2014 and was not aware of any interaction between Landasoft and the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.\\n\\nIn the autumn of 2015, months after the Xinjiang expo, Landasoft signed contracts with Xinjiang police, emails show. Workers installed millions of cameras and wired over 7,000 police outposts, often built just hundreds of meters apart. Nearly 100,000 officers were recruited to pound on doors and collect names, addresses, fingerprints and face-scans.\\n\\nThough Chinese hardware was favored, foreign software was irreplaceable for its performance and compatibility with China’s American-built systems, engineers told AP. That included server and database software from Oracle and Microsoft and cloud software from VMWare, which Dell acquired in 2016.\\n\\nIn late 2016, the crackdown began. Internal documents, a leaked copy of the Landasoft software and interviews with 16 former Xinjiang police officers, officials and engineers reveal how the system worked.\\n\\nLandasoft’s software combined data fed into a central police database to compile a dossier on vast swaths of Xinjiang’s population, tagging them with categories like “went on pilgrimage” or “studied abroad.” Administrators then questioned them, computed risk scores and decided who to detain.\\n\\nHundreds of thousands of people were tagged “untrustworthy”, leaked messages show. Leaked documents show the IJOP flagged 24,412 people as “suspicious” in just one week in 2017, leading to most being detained.\\n\\n“They thought it better to grab thousands of innocents than let a single criminal slip free,” Abliz said.\\n\\nThe technology was crude and flawed. Landasoft emails show engineers frantically fixing a software bug to release hundreds of people categorized as high-risk. And surveillance cameras often misidentified people, a former Xinjiang police officer found when he checked their ID cards.\\n\\nYet officers were told “computers cannot lie” and that the IJOP’s listed targets were “absolutely correct,” Abliz said. The software’s orders were often obeyed fearfully, unquestioningly.\\n\\n“The tech companies told the government their software is perfect,” Abliz said. “It’s all a myth.”\\n\\nMinority report\\n\\nThe all-encompassing surveillance forced total compliance: Officers arrested colleagues, neighbors informed on each other.\\n\\nIn May 2017, Kalbinur Sidik, a teacher now in the Netherlands, was summoned to her district government office in a yellow brick apartment building in Xinjiang’s capital. A young Uyghur woman, fresh from college, rose and introduced herself as a local official. Sidik, the woman explained, was being appointed as the head of her building, responsible for collecting information on neighbors.\\n\\n“What’s this data going to be used for?” Sidik asked.\\n\\nThe woman looked at a computer, with a Landasoft program running and lists of names and tags: “Goes out at night,” “Overseas phone,” “unemployed.” One button stood out: “Push Alert.”\\n\\nThe woman clicked it, and the screen filled with names. These people, the woman explained, would be detained and interrogated for suspected ties to terrorism. Sidik’s eyes widened.\\n\\n“I hated her for what she was doing,” Sidik said. “I knew those people would disappear.”\\n\\nXinjiang officials issued arrest quotas, Sidik and five other former officers and administrators said. Sidik watched with horror as the number of people who attended her compound’s weekly mandatory flag-raising ceremony shrank, from 400 to just over 100, as residents were arrested.\\n\\nAt the district office, she observed the logos popping up on screens: Oracle, Microsoft, Intel. The AP found evidence of products from all three companies used in Xinjiang’s policing and data systems during the crackdown, along with Esri, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Thermo Fisher, and VMWare, then owned by Dell, which advertised cooperation with Xinjiang authorities on its website.\\n\\nSidik asked her neighborhood official where it all came from.\\n\\n“We’ve spent a lot of money to import foreign technology,” she recalls the official telling her.\\n\\nAmong those caught in the digital dragnet was Parida Qabylqai, an ethnic Kazakh pharmacist at a military hospital in Xinjiang.\\n\\nIn February 2018, Qabylqai was flagged by the IJOP for visiting her parents in Kazakhstan. At first, her boss thought it was a mistake.\\n\\n“You’re a good person, you shouldn’t be listed,” she recalled him saying. Then he checked the IJOP and spotted her name.\\n\\n“It’s really serious! You’re going to end up in the camps,” he blurted out in shock.\\n\\nAn officer pressed a confession into her hands.\\n\\n“What did I do wrong?” Qabylqai asked.\\n\\n“Just sign!” the officer shouted.\\n\\nQabylqai was cuffed, hooded, and whisked to a camp, where cameras watched her day and night, even peering at her naked body in the toilet. Guards barking over speakers ordered her not to speak or even to move.\\n\\n“They did things to us that no human being should ever have to experience,” she said. “But they said my name was listed by the IJOP, so they didn’t need to explain anything.”\\n\\nEven enforcers of the system weren’t spared.\\n\\nIn 2018, Liu Yuliang, a civil servant in Xinjiang, was ordered to the home of a young police officer in his village. He and dozens of others stood, silent, as the officer embraced his sobbing, pregnant wife.\\n\\nThe officer had forced many people into the camps. Then he himself was flagged for detention.\\n\\nToo fearful to resist, Liu went along with the arrest, just as the young officer had done before him.\\n\\nLandasoft software alerted police when flagged people did anything labeled suspicious, like going out at night or logging on the internet repeatedly. Liu was sent to knock on doors, questioning residents whose “eyes filled with fear.”\\n\\nAs police swept Xinjiang, Landasoft purchased software from Pivotal, a cloud company later acquired by Broadcom, emails show. And Landasoft registered accounts on both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in 2018, seeking to expand cloud offerings to police clients, emails show.\\n\\nAWS said Landasoft “consumed very limited cloud services for a brief period” and not for software in the Xinjiang crackdown. Microsoft said Landasoft used Azure services through a self-service portal retired in 2021, and that any Landasoft data was deleted.\\n\\nThe Xinjiang government told the AP: “There is absolutely no such thing as ‘large-scale human rights violations.’”\\n\\nLiu eventually resigned and returned to his hometown in eastern China, trying to forget what he had seen and done. But he noted with unease the new cameras and checkpoints being installed around his home.\\n\\nFour days later, state security called and summoned him for questioning. The all-seeing surveillance apparatus had followed him home.\\n\\n“The Xinjiang model is being copied everywhere, in every city in China,” Liu said.\\n\\nIn 2024, Liu left China, ignoring an airport officer who warned that wherever he went, he would be watched.\\n\\n“This technology has no emotions,” Liu said. “But in the hands of a government that doesn’t respect the law, it becomes a tool for evil.”\\n\\nAutomated autocracy\\n\\nThe Yangs are still trapped by U.S. technology. IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, and Seagate servers, switches and drives power police systems targeting them, maintenance contracts dating to this year show. Intel and Nvidia chips process data. Oracle and VMWare software run the database.\\n\\nBut the harder the Yangs push, the harder the system pushes back.\\n\\nIn February 2023, they went to the National Public Complaints Administration in Beijing with a letter. Two days later, police grabbed them from their hotel and drove them home.\\n\\nThe Yangs persisted, trying to plead their case to Beijing. In the following months, they were seized at bus and train stations, beaten at a hospital and abducted by ambulance.\\n\\nLast July, Yang’s mother tried again. She carried a letter for Chinese leader Xi Jinping:\\n\\n“They’re using violence and kidnapping to bar me from petitioning and seeking medical treatment ... We beg you, General Secretary, to save us.”\\n\\nOutside Beijing’s leadership compound, burly men in black tackled Yang’s mother to the ground. She was jailed for over a month, questioned, strip-searched, force-fed medication and deprived of food and water. In October, she and Yang’s sister disappeared.\\n\\nThe Yangs’ house is now the last left standing. The father lives alone.\\n\\nHis relatives have cut contact, unnerved by the flock of police that tail him. Thousands of pages of documents stashed in drawers, stuffed in bags, and piled in boxes in a bathtub chronicle every step of their 16-year quest for justice.\\n\\nIn April, Yang was sent criminal charges showing how much police had spent to stop the family’s “abnormal petitioning.”\\n\\nThe cost: About $37,000.\\n\\n__\\n\\nYael Grauer is an independent investigative tech reporter.

       " {'headline': 'How does Tesla get to $8.5 trillion value? Robots, robotaxis and hope',\n",
       "  'content': 'By Abhirup Roy and Akash Sriram\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -How can Tesla (TSLA) become an $8.5 trillion company? That\\'s the market valuation the electric vehicle maker would have to reach to justify CEO Elon Musk\\'s new pay package announced last week.\\n\\nSelling 100 million humanoid robots in a year could do it; creating a robotaxi network with more than 10 times the revenue of Uber might as well. And of course, investor hope is part of the equation.\\n\\nMusk on Friday was given a decade to expand Tesla\\'s $1 trillion valuation into a company worth more than the combined current value of Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), the two most valuable publicly traded companies in the world. If he succeeds, Musk, already the best-paid CEO in the world, would receive a trillion-dollar pay package.\\n\\nMusk\\'s new pay package was granted on September 3, but it is subject to shareholder approval in November.\\n\\nThe board showed how and where it expects Tesla to make its money by structuring Musk\\'s pay package around 12 milestones that are primarily based on products and profit, as well as market capitalization. They target enormous increases in profit as Tesla rolls out its Optimus humanoid robots and a robotaxi fleet that it hopes will be more efficient than human-driven rivals.\\n\\nA lot depends on how investors value the company. Tesla, for example, is valued as a growth stock, trading at around 75 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, even though its vehicle sales dropped last year and are likely to drop this year.\\n\\nThe payoff is astounding - and so are the goals. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, broadly estimated that robotaxis and self-driving software could be worth a trillion dollars of market cap each, with cars another half-trillion. \"At the end of the day, the reason why this is going to work or not work really comes down to Optimus,\" he said. \"It\\'s a fairy tale, but it\\'s one that could actually happen.\"\\n\\nMusk has been betting the company on self-driving software and robotaxis for some time. Tesla currently has a small fleet of robotaxis - estimated to be about three dozen vehicles - in a part of Austin, Texas. An early Musk milestone is to have a million robotaxis in operation.\\n\\nOne of Tesla\\'s biggest fans, ARK Invest, predicted an even sunnier case well before the Musk pay package was announced. They see Tesla\\'s market capitalization hitting $7 trillion to $10.9 trillion in 2029, with a Tesla robotaxi network bringing in between $603 billion and $951 billion of ride-hail revenue per year. Global ride-hailing leader Uber, by comparison, will have revenue of $52 billion this year, according to LSEG.',\n",

Here's what investors need to know today.\\n\\n1. Stock Futures Tick Higher as Indexes Hover Near Record Highs\\n\\nStock futures are slightly higher this morning after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high on Monday, as stocks rallied amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon. The benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average come into today's session just below all-time highs of their own. Bitcoin (BTCUSD), which has been under pressure in recent weeks, is up slightly at $112,500. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is ticking higher after hitting its lowest level since April yesterday, while gold and oil futures are also edging upwards in early trading. (Read Investopedia's real-time markets coverage here.)\\n\\n2. Nebius Group Soars on AI Deal with Microsoft\\n\\nNebius Group (NBIS) shares are up more than 50% in premarket trading after the AI infrastructure company announced a multi-year deal with Microsoft (MSFT). Amsterdam-based Nebius will provide Microsoft with dedicated capacity at its new data center in Vineland, New Jersey starting later this year, the company said. CNBC reported the deal was worth $19.4 billion. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) owns a stake in Nebius. “The deal will also help us to accelerate the growth of our AI cloud business even further in 2026 and beyond,” said Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh. Microsoft and Nvidia shares inched higher in premarket trading.\\n\\n3. Lachlan Murdoch Gains Control of Fox, News Corp in New Family Deal\\n\\nA deal has been reached to end the yearslong fight over control of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch that includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Lachlan Murdoch, who is the CEO of Fox (FOX) and chair of News Corp (NWS), will take control of the trust that holds sizable stakes in both of his father’s companies. As part of the deal, Rupert Murdoch’s children Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will end their claim to the company. Shares of Fox and News Corp were each down nearly 5% in recent premarket trading.\\n\\n4. Oracle Expected to Grow Quarterly Revenue Amid New Cloud Deals\\n\\nInvestors are awaiting quarterly results from Oracle (ORCL), which are scheduled to be released after markets close today. The cloud computing giant is expected to post a 13% year-over-year jump in quarterly revenue to $15 billion, according to analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase to $1.48. The report comes after Oracle shares hit an all-time-high earlier this year on the announcement of $30 billion in new cloud deals. The stock, which has gained more than 40% since the start of 2025, was up about 1% in premarket trading.\\n\\n5. Teck, Anglo American Merge to Form Copper Mining Giant\\n\\nMining firms Teck Resources (TECK) and Anglo American have agreed to merge to form a new global minerals company that will be one of the world’s largest producers of copper. The new company, to be called Anglo Teck, will have a combined market capitalization of more than $53 billion. “Anglo Teck will hold an industry-leading portfolio of producing operations, including six world-class copper assets, alongside high-quality premium iron ore and zinc businesses,” Teck said in a release. Shares of Canada-based Teck Resources were up about 17% in premarket trading, while U.K.-based Anglo American gained about 8% in London trading.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'News Summary:\\n\\nThe NVIDIA Rubin CPX GPU is purpose-built to handle million-token coding and generative video applications.\\n\\nThe NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX platform packs 8 exaflops of AI performance and 100TB of fast memory in a single rack.\\n\\nCompanies can monetize at an unprecedented scale, with $5B in token revenue for every $100M invested.\\n\\nAI innovators like Cursor, Runway and Magic are exploring how Rubin CPX can accelerate their applications.\\n\\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AI Infra Summit -- NVIDIA® today announced NVIDIA Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU purpose-built for massive-context processing. This enables AI systems to handle million-token software coding and generative video with groundbreaking speed and efficiency.\\n\\nRubin CPX works hand in hand with NVIDIA Vera CPUs and Rubin GPUs inside the new NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX platform. This integrated NVIDIA MGX system packs 8 exaflops of AI compute to provide 7.5x more AI performance than NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, as well as 100TB of fast memory and 1.7 petabytes per second of memory bandwidth in a single rack. A dedicated Rubin CPX compute tray will also be offered for customers looking to reuse existing Vera Rubin 144 systems.\\n\\n“The Vera Rubin platform will mark another leap in the frontier of AI computing — introducing both the next-generation Rubin GPU and a new category of processors called CPX,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Just as RTX revolutionized graphics and physical AI, Rubin CPX is the first CUDA GPU purpose-built for massive-context AI, where models reason across millions of tokens of knowledge at once.”\\n\\nNVIDIA Rubin CPX enables the highest performance and token revenue for long-context processing — far beyond what today’s systems were designed to handle. This transforms AI coding assistants from simple code-generation tools into sophisticated systems that can comprehend and optimize large-scale software projects.\\n\\nTo process video, AI models can take up to 1 million tokens for an hour of content, pushing the limits of traditional GPU compute. Rubin CPX integrates video decoder and encoders, as well as long-context inference processing, in a single chip for unprecedented capabilities in long-format applications such as video search and high-quality generative video.\\n\\nBuilt on the NVIDIA Rubin architecture, the Rubin CPX GPU uses a cost‑efficient, monolithic die design packed with powerful NVFP4 computing resources and is optimized to deliver extremely high performance and energy efficiency for AI inference tasks.\\n\\nAdvancements Offered by Rubin CPX\\n\\nRubin CPX delivers up to 30 petaflops of compute with NVFP4 precision for the highest performance and accuracy. It features 128GB of cost-efficient GDDR7 memory to accelerate the most demanding context-based workloads. In addition, it delivers 3x faster attention capabilities compared with NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems — boosting an AI model’s ability to process longer context sequences without a drop in speed.\\n\\nRubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX, that can be combined with the NVIDIA Quantum‑X800 InfiniBand scale-out compute fabric or the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet networking platform with NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology and NVIDIA ConnectX®-9 SuperNICs™. Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX enables companies to monetize at an unprecedented scale, with $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested.\\n\\nIndustry Leaders Look to Rubin CPX\\n\\nAI innovators are exploring how Rubin CPX can accelerate their applications, ranging from large-scale software development to the analysis of dynamic visual content to better understand moving images.\\n\\nCursor, an AI-powered software company that offers an advanced code editor, sees the benefits of Rubin CPX to boost developer productivity with intelligent code generation and collaborative tools directly in the coding environment.\\n\\n“With NVIDIA Rubin CPX, Cursor will be able to deliver lightning-fast code generation and developer insights, transforming software creation,” said Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor. “This will unlock new levels of productivity and empower users to ship ideas once out of reach.”\\n\\nRunway, an American generative AI company, will use NVIDIA technologies to enable creators to produce cinematic content and sophisticated visual effects with unmatched scale and efficiency.\\n\\n“Video generation is rapidly advancing toward longer context and more flexible, agent-driven creative workflows,” said Cristóbal Valenzuela, CEO of Runway. “We see Rubin CPX as a major leap in performance, supporting these demanding workloads to build more general, intelligent creative tools. This means creators — from independent artists to major studios — can gain unprecedented speed, realism and control in their work.”\\n\\nMagic is an AI research and product company developing foundation models to power AI agents that can automate software engineering.\\n\\n“With a 100-million-token context window, our models can see a codebase, years of interaction history, documentation and libraries in context without fine-tuning,” said Eric Steinberger, CEO of Magic. “This enables users to coach the agent at test time through conversation and access to their environments, bringing us closer to autonomous agentic experiences. Using a GPU like NVIDIA Rubin CPX greatly accelerates our compute workloads.”\\n\\nSoftware Support\\n\\nNVIDIA Rubin CPX will be supported by the complete NVIDIA AI stack — from accelerated infrastructure to enterprise‑ready software. The NVIDIA Dynamo platform efficiently scales AI inference, dramatically boosting throughput while cutting response times and model serving costs.\\n\\nThe processors will be able to run the latest in the NVIDIA Nemotron™ family of multimodal models that provide state-of-the-art reasoning for enterprise-ready AI agents. For production-grade AI, Nemotron models can be delivered with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software platform that includes NVIDIA NIM ™ microservices as well as AI frameworks, libraries and tools that enterprises can deploy on NVIDIA-accelerated clouds, data centers and workstations.\\n\\nBuilt on decades of innovation, the Rubin platform extends NVIDIA’s developer ecosystem — with NVIDIA CUDA‑X ™ libraries, a community of over 6 million developers and nearly 6,000 CUDA applications.\\n\\nAvailability\\n\\nNVIDIA Rubin CPX is expected to be available at the end of 2026.\\n\\nLearn more by watching NVIDIA Vice President of Hyperscale and High-Performance Computing Ian Buck’s keynote at AI Infra Summit on Sept. 9 at 10am PT.\\n\\nAbout NVIDIA\\n\\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\\n\\nFor further information, contact:\\n\\nKristin Uchiyama\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation\\n\\n+1-408-313-0448\\n\\nkuchiyama@nvidia.com\\n\\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: Vera Rubin systems continuing to deliver extraordinary performance and efficiency; with Rubin CPX, building a GPU uniquely suited for million-token context processing, cutting the cost of inference and unlocking advanced capabilities for developers and creators everywhere; the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of NVIDIA’s products, services, and technologies; expectations with respect to NVIDIA’s third party arrangements, including with its collaborators and partners; expectations with respect to technology developments; and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

       "  'content': 'AI models, inference engine backends, and distributed inference frameworks continue to evolve in architecture, complexity, and scale. With the rapid pace of change, deploying and efficiently managing AI inference pipelines that support these advanced capabilities becomes a critical challenge.\\n\\nNVIDIA NIM Operator is designed to help you scale intelligently. It enables Kubernetes cluster administrators to operate the software components and services necessary to run NVIDIA NIM inference microservices for the latest LLMs and multimodal AI models, including reasoning, retrieval, vision, speech, biology, and more.\\n\\nThe latest release of NIM Operator 3.0.0 introduces expanded capabilities to simplify and optimize the deployment of NVIDIA NIM microservices and NVIDIA NeMo microservices across Kubernetes environments. NIM Operator 3.0.0 supports efficient resource utilization and integrates seamlessly with your existing Kubernetes infrastructure, including KServe deployments.\\n\\nNVIDIA customers and partners have been using the NIM Operator to efficiently manage inference pipelines for a variety of applications and AI agents, including chatbots, agentic RAG, and virtual drug discovery.\\n\\nNVIDIA has recently collaborated with Red Hat to enable NIM deployment on KServe with the NIM Operator. “Red Hat contributed to the NIM Operator open source GitHub repo to enable NVIDIA NIM deployment on KServe,” said Red Hat Director of Engineering Babak Mozaffari. “This feature allows the NIM Operator to deploy NIM microservices that benefit from KServe lifecycle management and simplifies scalable NIM deployment using NIM service. Native KServe support in the NIM Operator also allows users to benefit from model caching with NIM cache and leverage NeMo capabilities like NeMo Guardrails for building Trusted AI for all your KServe Inference endpoints.”\\n\\nThis post explains new capabilities in the NIM Operator 3.0.0 release, including:\\n\\nFigure 1. NIM Operator architecture\\n\\nFlexible NIM deployment: Multi-LLM compatible and multi-node\\n\\nNIM Operator 3.0.0 adds support for easy, fast NIM deployment. You can use it with a domain-specific NIM—such as those for biology, speech, or retrieval—or various NIM deployment options, including multi-LLM compatible, or multi-node.\\n\\nMulti-LLM compatible NIM deployment: Deploy diverse models with custom weights from sources like NVIDIA NGC, Hugging Face, or local storage. Use the NIM cache custom resource definition (CRD) to download weights to PVCs and the NIM service CRD to manage deployment, scaling, and ingress.\\n\\nDeploy diverse models with custom weights from sources like NVIDIA NGC, Hugging Face, or local storage. Use the NIM cache custom resource definition (CRD) to download weights to PVCs and the NIM service CRD to manage deployment, scaling, and ingress. Multi-node NIM deployment addresses the challenge of deploying massive LLMs that cannot fit on a single GPU or need to run on multiple GPUs and potentially on multiple nodes. NIM Operator supports caching for multi-node NIM deployment using the NIM cache CRD, and deploying them using the NIM service CRD on Kubernetes with LeaderWorkerSets (LWS).\\n\\nNote that the multi-node NIM deployment without GPUDirect RDMA may result in frequent restarts of LWS leader and worker pods due to model shard loading timeouts. Using fast network connectivity such as IPoIB or ROCE is highly recommended and can be easily configured through the NVIDIA Network Operator.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the deployment of large language models (LLMs) from the Hugging Face library on Kubernetes using the NVIDIA NIM Operator as a multi-LLM NIM deployment. It specifically demonstrates deploying the Llama 3 8B Instruct model, including service and pod status verification, followed by a curl command to send a request to the service.\\n\\nFigure 2. Multi-LLM deployment of the Llama 3 8B Instruct model using NIM Operator\\n\\nEfficient GPU utilization with DRA\\n\\nDRA is a built-in Kubernetes feature that simplifies GPU management by replacing traditional device plugins with a more flexible and extensible approach. DRA enables users to define GPU device classes, request GPUs based on those classes, and filter them according to workload and business needs.\\n\\nNIM Operator 3.0.0 supports DRA under technology preview by configuring ResourceClaim and ResourceClaimTemplate on NIM Pod through both the NIM service CRD and NIM Pipeline CRD. You can either create and attach your own claims or let the NIM Operator create and manage them automatically.\\n\\nThe NIM Operator DRA supports:\\n\\nFull GPU and MIG usage\\n\\nGPU sharing through time slicing by assigning the same claim to multiple NIM services\\n\\nNote: This feature is currently available as a technology preview, with full support available soon.\\n\\nFigure 3 demonstrates the deployment of Llama 3 8B Instruct NIM using Kubernetes DRA with NIM Operator. Users can define a resource claim in a NIM service to request specific hardware attributes such as GPU architecture and memory, and interact with the deployed LLM using curl .\\n\\nFigure 3. Deployment of Llama 3 8B Instruct NIM using Kubernetes DRA with NIM Operator\\n\\nSeamless deployment on KServe\\n\\nKServe is a widely adopted open source inference serving platform used by many partners and customers. NIM Operator 3.0.0 supports both raw and serverless deployments on KServe by configuring the InferenceService custom resource to manage deployment, upgrades, and autoscaling of NIM. NIM Operator simplifies the deployment process by automatically configuring all required environment variables and resources in the InferenceService CRDs.\\n\\nThis integration delivers two additional benefits:\\n\\nIntelligent caching with NIM cache to reduce initial inference time and autoscaling latency, resulting in faster and more responsive deployments.\\n\\nNeMo microservices support for evaluation, guardrails, and customization to enhance AI systems for latency, accuracy, cost, and compliance.\\n\\nFigure 4 shows the deployment of the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct NIM on KServe using NIM Operator. Two distinct deployment methodologies are shown: RawDeployment and Serverless. The Serverless deployment incorporates autoscaling functionality through K8s annotation. Both strategies use a curl command to test the responses of the NIM.\\n\\nFigure 4. Deployment of the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct NIM on KServe using NIM Operator with both RawDeployment and Serverless methodologies\\n\\nGet started scaling AI inference with NIM Operator 3.0.0\\n\\nNVIDIA NIM Operator 3.0.0 makes deploying scalable AI inference easier than ever. Whether you’re working with multi-LLM compatible or multi-node NIM deployment, optimizing GPU usage with DRA, or deploying on KServe, this release enables you to build high-performance, flexible, and scalable AI applications.\\n\\nBy automating the deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management of both NVIDIA NIM and NVIDIA NeMo microservices, NIM Operator makes it easier for enterprise teams to adopt AI workflows. This effort aligns with making AI workflows easy to deploy with NVIDIA AI Blueprints, enabling quick movement to production.

A bulk of that reaction had to do with the revenue that AI computing demand was expected to bring to Oracle’s cloud infrastructure service.\\n\\nThe shares skyrocketed in response. Oracle’s stock is now on pace to have its largest single session surge since the dot-com boom, according to CNBC.\\n\\nWith the current surge in shares, Ellison has increased his wealth by more than $100 billion, thanks to the roughly 1.16 billion shares he owns. This meteoric rise grabbed him the title of the richest person on Earth from the former title holder, Elon Musk, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\n\\nAs of Tuesday, Ellison’s current total fortune was worth $295 billion, having increased by $100 billion in worth in just the past year. Today’s additional increase has catapulted him to a staggering $389 billion, surpassing Elon Musk’s whopping $384 billion fortune.\\n\\nMusk was first named the richest man in the world in 2021, and has since been up and down on the list. He has held the title consistently since last year and briefly became the first person to surpass $400 billion net worth in December. Although Ellison has overtaken him on the list, Musk might reverse that yet again soon. Musk is facing the potential of becoming the world’s first trillionaire, that is if the massive and unprecedented proposed pay package plan by the Tesla board gets approved by shareholders.\\n\\nOracle’s AI success story\\n\\nLarry Ellison co-founded Oracle in the late 1970s with the CIA as an early customer. Decades down the line, the database software company now specializes in AI-first cloud computing and competes with other giants like Microsoft’s Azure, Alphabet’s Google Cloud, and Amazon’s AWS. It’s the aggressively positive and AI-driven outlook for its cloud infrastructure business that has led to investor delight and the 81-year-old Ellison is benefiting handsomely from it.\\n\\nAlthough the revenue estimates were down, the company said it was expecting to collect more than half a trillion dollars extra thanks to four multi-billion-dollar contracts it signed in the past quarter. At the company’s earnings call, CEO Safra Catz mentioned OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD, and Elon Musk’s xAI as some of the company it has “significant cloud contracts with.”\\n\\nCompany executives shared that they are expecting to finalize even more multi-billion-dollar deals in the near future.\\n\\nOracle, and Ellison, are hell-bent on AI. The company recently made headlines for an alleged plan to spend more than $1 billion a year to run a new data center in Texas on gas generators rather than wait for approval and infrastructure to pull the electricity from the local grid. Oracle is also one of the partners in the Trump administration’s ambitious AI project Stargate.\\n\\nCloud computing is the hot name in AI earnings\\n\\nCloud computing might be one of the clearest early winners of the AI hype. AI companies are scouring for more computing capacity as they try to compete with each other and scale operations, and they are willing to spend a hefty amount of money for it. Enter cloud infrastructure providers, like Oracle and Microsoft, that provide computing power for large AI models. Both the companies showed a meteoric stock increase after their recent earnings report.\\n\\nIn its latest earnings report in July, Microsoft reported that sales were up 18% from last year and that revenue for its cloud computing platform Azure had surpassed $75 billion this year, up 34% from last. Despite these numbers accompanying Microsoft’s largest ever quarterly capital expenditure forecast, the market went crazy for it. The shares jumped and the tech giant briefly became the second-ever company to hit $4 trillion market valuation.',\n",

Or at least, to enable without simultaneously committing framerateicide.\\n\\nOn the other hand, 100 is a very round and satisfying number. Just look at it. Way better than 112 or some garbage. I do wonder if anyone working in Gearbox’s gigabyte dieting department saw it was possible to compress it down to 99GB, potentially avoiding the shock of entering the triple digits, but left it at 100GB just because it’s vaguely nicer. I suspect I’d do the same.\\n\\nAnyway, here’s the hardware:\\n\\nBorderlands 4 minimum PC specs\\n\\nOS: Windows 10 / 11\\n\\nWindows 10 / 11 CPU: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8 core minimum)\\n\\nIntel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8 core minimum) RAM: 16GB\\n\\n16GB GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580 (8GB minimum)\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580 (8GB minimum) Storage: 100GB (SSD required)\\n\\nBorderlands 4 recommended PC specs\\n\\nOS: Windows 10 / Windows 11\\n\\nWindows 10 / Windows 11 CPU: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X\\n\\nIntel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X RAM: 32GB\\n\\n32GB GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT / Intel Arc B580\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT / Intel Arc B580 Storage: 100GB (SSD required)\\n\\nSolid state hungriness aside, it’s a bit strange seeing the Arc B580 in the recommended tier, alongside the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT – it’s a good little budget card but not on the same level as those two older, yet bonafide high-end GPUs. Though maybe that means Borderlands 4 performs better-than-recommended on this Nvidia/AMD kit?\\n\\nAlso, 2K’s post doesn’t mention it specifically, but DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is supported as well. This needs a GeForce RTX 50 series card to operate at full pelt, with RTX 40 models making do with DLSS 3-style 2x frame gen.\\n\\nI’m generally in the 'wait and see how it is' camp on Fourderlands, with its new planet and its many billions of randomly generated firearms, having previously been interested enough to mulch through Borderlands 3 with mates but jointly concluding it wasn’t worth our time. This new one is something of a reset, with its lead writer Taylor Clark claiming it won’t have as many jokes. Which is, at once, likely an improvement and also a weird thing to make a selling point of. B4's out on September 12th.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\\n\\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Phani Sai Ram Munipalli, a 28-year-old full-time AI/tech product manager from Santa Clara, California. It\\'s been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nI worked for four years as a full-time software engineer — two years at IBM and two years at Walmart Global Tech — after completing my undergraduate program in India in 2017.\\n\\nIn July 2022, I left software engineering and chose to shift my career path to compete for an AI/tech product management role at Walmart in the US, even though I had little experience in that field.\\n\\nMy career change wasn\\'t motivated by the idea of potentially making more money — I believe in technology that can change lives.\\n\\nThis journey began not with a job application but with a realization in 2022\\n\\nRight as ChatGPT was introduced to the world, I knew a massive shift was coming, and my technical background was my unique entry point into the AI talent wars.\\n\\nI started my master\\'s program in computer software engineering at San Jose State University in August 2022. During my master\\'s summer, I did a product management internship at Walmart. I graduated from with my degree in May 2024 and joined Walmart as a full-time product manager in July 2024.\\n\\nI love coding and still do it for my side projects, but I wanted to go beyond just writing code. I wanted to understand what products can be built leveraging AI, who the users are, and how it\\'s helping them.\\n\\nThis recognition led to a self-assessment and a personal road map to create my own AI-centric playbook around three core strategies.\\n\\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\\n1. I rewired my brain for AI product thinking\\n\\nMy technical background helped me grasp AI concepts, but I needed to learn how to think like an AI product leader. In 2023, I took on an additional role at my university as an AI research assistant in conversational AI.\\n\\nTo add to my AI expertise and rewire my brain for AI product thinking, I went all in on a self-education sprint. I listened to podcasts like Lenny\\'s Podcast and the Nvidia AI Podcast, which focus on the complexities of productionizing AI and learning the crucial lesson that AI is never the product itself — solving a user\\'s problem is.\\n\\nI also completed Google\\'s \"Responsible AI: Applying AI Principles with Google Cloud\" credential in December 2023 and the AI Product Management Bootcamp led by Marily Nika, a former Google AI product manager, in April 2024.\\n\\nFinally, I put theory into practice by building several web apps — including LinkPlus, VibeCard, and SafeWord AI — using both OpenAI\\'s and Google\\'s Gemini APIs, teaching myself the real-world challenges of prompt engineering and leveraging LLMs.\\n\\n2. I ditched popular frameworks in interviews\\n\\nWhen it came time to interview for my summer product management internship at Walmart, I knew that reciting standard product frameworks would be a failing strategy.\\n\\nI was an underdog among 20+ intern candidates from top schools. I knew I had to prove myself. My differentiator wasn\\'t a textbook answer; it was the portfolio of AI projects I\\'d built and the platform I\\'d created.\\n\\nInstead of trying to impress with pure technical knowledge, I focused on translating it. I used storytelling — especially the \"Hero\\'s Journey\" technique in my presentations — to craft compelling narratives explaining how these AI solutions could solve real, human problems for Walmart\\'s gig drivers.\\n\\nThis approach — proving I could not only understand AI but also build with it and communicate its value — is what landed me the internship at Walmart. This focus on bridging the gap between complex tech and user needs was so successful that it also secured me a full-time return offer at Walmart for my current position, which I started in July 2024.\\n\\n3. I built a platform to give first and networked second\\n\\nI believed an AI-focused product manager should have their own product, so in March 2023, I started a podcast, The Hustle Chapters, and a newsletter, Phani\\'s Product.\\n\\nMy podcast platform completely flipped the networking dynamic. Instead of asking for 15-minute coffee chats, I invited directors and founders onto my show, offering them value first.\\n\\nI hosted 21 builders from the AI space, learning directly from them about the myths of building AI. This approach built genuine connections and directly led to a spring internship offer from VComply in 2024.\\n\\nThen — even after securing my role at Walmart — I took on a subsequent spring internship focused entirely on the complex challenge of productizing an LLM-based application for enterprise users. I experimented with running LLMs on my local machine and then documented the entire setup process in a technical guide for my newsletter.\\n\\nThis trial-by-fire experience — tackling the nuances of bringing cutting-edge LLMs into a real-world business context — gave me an even deeper level of practical knowledge to bring to my full-time position.\\n\\nI also regularly published one-pagers and newsletters analyzing how Big Tech companies use AI and data to create superior customer experiences, building a small but engaged audience of tech professionals.\\n\\nThis three-pronged approach helped me pivot successfully\\n\\nI\\'ve spent a year on my team full-time, solving fascinating problems for gig drivers in Walmart\\'s Last Mile Delivery ecosystem. I work in the realm of AI, LLM, and ML in product management — a complete gearshift from my former full-time roles as a software engineer.\\n\\nUltimately, my journey is a playbook for forging your own path, proving that the right strategy and mindset about pivoting into AI or another area are more powerful than a traditional background.',\n",

       " {'headline': 'AI Is Coming for YouTube Creators',\n",
       "  'content': 'Editor’s note: This analysis is part of The Atlantic’s investigation into how YouTube videos are taken to train AI tools. You can use the search tool directly here, to see whether videos you’ve created or watched are included in the data sets. This work is part of AI Watchdog, The Atlantic’s ongoing investigation into the generative-AI industry.\\n\\nWhen Jon Peters uploaded his first video to YouTube in 2010, he had no idea where it would lead. He was a professional woodworker running a small business who decided to film himself making a dining table with some old legs he had found in a barn. It turned out that people liked his candid style, and as he posted more videos, a fan base began to grow. “All of a sudden there’s people who appreciate the work I’m doing,” he told me. “The comments were a motivator.” Fifteen years later, his channel has more than 1 million subscribers. Sometimes he gets photos of people in their shops, following his guidance from a big TV on the wall—most of his viewers, Peters told me, are woodworkers looking to him for instruction.\\n\\nBut Peters’s channel could soon be obsolete, along with millions of other videos created by people who share their expertise and advice on YouTube. Over the past few months, I’ve discovered more than 15.8 million videos from more than 2 million channels that tech companies have, without permission, downloaded to train AI products. Nearly 1 million of them, by my count, are how-to videos. You can find these videos in at least 13 different data sets distributed by AI developers at tech companies, universities, and research organizations, through websites such as Hugging Face, an online AI-development hub.\\n\\nIn most cases the videos are anonymized, meaning that titles and creator names are not included. I was able to identify the videos by extracting unique identifiers from the data sets and looking them up on YouTube—similar to the process I followed when I revealed the contents of the Books3, OpenSubtitles, and LibGen data sets. You can search the data sets using the tool below, typing in channel names like “MrBeast” or “James Charles,” for example.\\n\\n(A note for users: Just because a video appears in these data sets does not mean it was used for training by AI companies, which could choose to omit certain videos when developing their products.)\\n\\nTo create AI products capable of generating video, developers need huge quantities of videos, and YouTube has become a common source. Although YouTube does offer paying subscribers the ability to download videos and watch them through the company’s app whenever they’d like, this is something different: Video files are being ripped from YouTube en masse and saved in files that are then fed to AI algorithms. This kind of downloading violates the platform’s terms of service, but many tools allow AI developers to download videos in this way. YouTube appears to have done little, if anything, to stop the mass downloading, and the company did not respond to my request for comment.\\n\\nNot all YouTube videos are copyrighted (and some are uploaded by people who don’t own the copyrights), but many are. Unauthorized copying or distribution of those videos is illegal, but whether AI training constitutes a form of copying or distribution is still a question being debated in many ongoing lawsuits. Tech companies have argued that training is a “fair use” of copyrighted work, and some judges have disagreed in their responses. How the courts ultimately apply the law to this novel technology could have massive consequences for creators’ motivations to post their work on YouTube and similar platforms—if tech companies are able to continue taking creators’ work to build AI products that compete with them, then creators may have little choice but to stop sharing.\\n\\nGenerative-AI tools are already producing videos that compete with human-made work on YouTube. AI-generated history videos with hundreds of thousands of views and many inaccuracies are drowning out fact-checked, expert-produced content. Popular music-remix videos are frequently created using this technology, and many of them perform better than human-made videos.\\n\\nThe problem extends far beyond YouTube, however. Most modern chatbots are “multimodal,” meaning they can respond to a question by creating relevant media. Google’s Gemini chatbot, for instance, will produce short clips for paying users. Soon, you may be able to ask ChatGPT or another generative-AI tool about how to build a table from found legs and get a custom how-to video in response. Even if that response isn’t as good as any video Peters would make, it will be immediate, and it will be tailor-made to your specifications. The online-publishing business has already been decimated by text-generation tools; video creators should expect similar challenges from generative-AI tools in the near future.\\n\\nMany major tech companies have used these data sets to train AI, according to research papers I’ve read and AI developers I’ve spoken with. The group includes Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Runway, ByteDance, Snap, and Tencent. I reached out to each of these companies to ask about their use of these data sets. Only Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia responded. All three said they “respect” content creators and believe that their use of the work is legal under existing copyright law. Amazon also shared that, where video is concerned, it is currently focused on developing ways to generate “compelling, high-quality advertisements from simple prompts.”\\n\\nWe can’t be certain whether all these companies will use the videos to create for-profit video-generating tools. Some of the work they’ve done may be simply experimental. But a few of these companies have an obvious interest in pursuing commercial products: Meta, for instance, is developing a suite of tools called Movie Gen that creates videos from text prompts, and Snap offers “AI Video Lenses” that allow users to augment their videos with generative AI. Videos such as the ones in these data sets are the raw material for products like these; much as ChatGPT couldn’t write like Shakespeare without first “reading” Shakespeare, a video generator couldn’t construct a fake newscast without “watching” tons of recorded broadcasts. In fact, a large number of the videos in these data sets are from news and educational channels, such as the BBC (which has at least 33,000 videos in the data sets, across its various brands) and TED (nearly 50,000). Hundreds of thousands of others—if not more—are from individual creators, such as Peters.\\n\\nAI companies are more interested in some videos than others. A spreadsheet leaked to 404 Media by a former employee at Runway, which builds AI video-generation tools, shows what the company valued about certain channels: “high camera movement,” “beautiful cinematic landscapes,” “high quality scenes from movies,” “super high quality sci-fi short films.” One channel was labeled “THE HOLY GRAIL OF CAR CINEMATICS SO FAR”; another was labeled “only 4 videos but they are really well done.”\\n\\nDevelopers seek out high-quality videos in a variety of ways. Curators of two of the data sets collected here—HowTo100M and HD-VILA-100M—prioritized videos with high view counts on YouTube, equating popularity with quality. The creators of another data set, HD-VG-130M, noted that “high view count does not guarantee video quality,” and used an AI model to select videos of high “aesthetic quality.” Data-set creators often try to avoid videos that contain overlaid text, such as subtitles and logos, so these identifying features don’t appear in videos generated by their model. So, some advice for YouTubers: Putting a watermark or logo on your videos, even a small one, makes them less desirable for training.\\n\\nTo prepare the videos for training, developers split the footage into short clips, in many cases cutting wherever there is a scene or camera change. Each clip is then given an English-language description of the visual scene so the model can be trained to correlate words with moving images, and to generate videos from text prompts. AI developers have a few methods of writing these captions. One way is to pay workers to do it. Another is to use separate AI models to generate a description automatically. The latter is more common, because of its lower cost.\\n\\nAI video tools aren’t yet as mainstream as chatbots or image generators, but they are already in wide use. You may already have seen AI-manipulated video without realizing it. For example, TED has been using AI to dub speakers’ talks in different languages. This includes the video as well as the audio: Speakers’ mouths are lip-synched with the new words so it looks like they’re speaking Japanese, French, or Russian. Nishat Ruiter, TED’s general counsel, told me this is done with the speakers’ knowledge and consent.\\n\\nThere are also consumer-facing products for tweaking videos with AI. If your face doesn’t look right, for example, you can try a face-enhancer such as Facetune, or ditch your mug entirely with a face-swapper such as Facewow. With Runway’s Aleph, you can change the colors of objects, or turn sunshine into a snowstorm.\\n\\nThen there are tools that generate new videos based on an image you provide. Google encourages Gemini users to animate their “favorite photos.” The result is a clip that extrapolates eight seconds of movement from an initial image, making a person dance, cook, or swing a golf club. These are often both amazing and creepy. “Talking head generation”—for employee-orientation videos, for example—is also advancing. Vidnoz AI promises to generate “Realistic AI Spokespersons of Any Style.” A company called Arcads will generate a complete advertisement, with actors and voiceover. ByteDance, the company that operates TikTok, offers a similar product called Symphony Creative Studio. Other applications of AI video generation include virtual try-on of clothes, generating custom video games, and animating cartoon characters and people.\\n\\nSome companies are both working with AI and simultaneously fighting to defend their content from being pilfered by AI companies. This reflects the Wild West mentality in AI right now—companies exploiting legal gray areas to see how they can profit. As I investigated these data sets, I learned about an incident involving TED—again, one of the most-pilfered organizations in the data sets captured here, and one that is attempting to employ AI to advance its own business. In June, the Cannes Lions international advertising festival gave one of its Grand Prix awards to an ad that included deepfaked footage from a TED talk by DeAndrea Salvador, currently a state senator in North Carolina. The ad agency, DM9, “used AI cloning to change her talk and repurposed it for a commercial ad campaign,” Ruiter told me on a video call recently. When the manipulation was discovered, the Cannes Lions festival withdrew the award. Last month, Salvador sued DM9 along with its clients—Whirlpool and Consul—for misappropriation of her likeness, among other things. DM9 apologized for the incident and cited “a series of failures in the production and sending” of the ad. A spokesperson from Whirlpool told me the company was unaware the senator’s remarks had been altered.\\n\\nOthers in the film industry have filed lawsuits against AI companies for training with their content. In June, Disney and Universal sued Midjourney, the maker of an image-generating tool that can produce images containing recognizable characters (Warner Brothers joined the lawsuit last week). The lawsuit called Midjourney a “bottomless pit of plagiarism.” The following month, two adult-film companies sued Meta for downloading (and distributing through BitTorrent) more than 2,000 of their videos. Neither Midjourney nor Meta has responded to the allegations, and neither responded to my request for comment. One YouTuber filed their own lawsuit: In August of last year, David Millette sued Nvidia for unjust enrichment and unfair competition with regard to the training of its Cosmos AI, but the case was voluntarily dismissed months later.\\n\\nThe Disney characters and the deepfaked Salvador ad are just two instances of how these tools can be damaging. The floodgates may soon be opening further. Thanks to the enormous amount of investment in the technology, generated videos are beginning to appear everywhere. One company, DeepBrain AI, pays “creators” to post AI-generated videos made with its tools on YouTube. It currently offers $500 for a video that gets 10,000 views, a relatively low threshold. Companies that run social-media platforms, such as Google and Meta, also pay users for content, through ad-revenue sharing, and many directly encourage the posting of AI-generated content. Not surprisingly, a coterie of gurus has arrived to teach the secrets of making money with AI-generated content.\\n\\nGoogle and Meta have also trained AI tools on large quantities of videos from their own platforms: Google has taken at least 70 million clips from YouTube, and Meta has taken more than 65 million clips from Instagram. If these companies succeed in flooding their platforms with synthetic videos, human creators could be left with the unenviable task of competing with machines that churn out endless content based on their original work. And social media will become even less social than it is.\\n\\nI asked Peters if he knew his videos had been taken from YouTube to train AI. He said he didn’t, but he wasn’t surprised. “I think everything’s gonna get stolen,” he told me. But he didn’t know what to do about it. “Do I quit, or do I just keep making videos and hope people want to connect with a person?”',\n",

       " {'headline': 'Hands-on: Nvidia GeForce Now’s Blackwell upgrade looks great, but you’ll need the right games',\n",
       "  'content': 'As promised, Nvidia is launching its Blackwell upgrade today for GeForce Now, bringing RTX 5080-based machines to the cloud service alongside a whole slew of other upgrades.\\n\\nWith the move to Blackwell architecture, GeForce Now subscribers on the $20/month Ultimate plan will now have support for DLSS 4 directly in the cloud. It’s capable of streaming at 5K 120 FPS — though there are very few true 5K displays available on the market at the moment — alongside 360 FPS support when running at 1080p. I was able to take a test run prior to today’s launch, and so far, what I’m seeing looks (and feels) very promising.\\n\\nThat said, how you benefit from an upgrade to Blackwell might primarily depend on the games you play; as someone who primarily focuses on single-player RPGs — with a pretty deep backlog of older titles to boot — the upgrade isn’t quite as impressive as it might be, say, if your Steam library has doubled in size this calendar year alone. That’s not to say RTX 5080 machines can’t bring refreshed visuals or improved performance to older titles, but it won’t be quite as impactful as if you’re playing fresh AAA releases like Doom: The Dark Ages or Assassin’s Creed Shadows.\\n\\nSomething that will affect titles, though, are the upgrades to visual performance coming to GeForce Now as part of this launch. A new “Cinematic Quality” setting is designed to optimize for visuals over all else, and assuming you have the network connection to handle it, it does deliver a noticeably improved experience over legacy quality settings. The specs sheet here is fairly impressive: 10-bit HDR with 4:4:4 chrome sampling, new AV1 encoders for improved network adaptation, and refreshed sharpness filters to help improve HUDs and on-screen text.\\n\\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\\n\\nGenerally, I’d say it’s a pretty big improvement, especially with a strong-enough connection. That said, on a big-enough display, anyone looking for imperfections can probably still find them. Text does look plenty legible, especially in games like The Witcher 3, where the HUD is fairly busy with plenty of information, and colors appear as rich and vibrant as if I was playing on, say, a PS5. But sitting close enough to a 32-inch 4K monitor, it’s still apparent that you’re watching a stream of a game, rather than the native gaming experience itself. That encoding sheen, for lack of a better phrase, is surprisingly downplayed, but it’ll likely even better with the right display — say, a television across your living room, or a Steam Deck in your hands.\\n\\nReally, the biggest problem still affecting GeForce Now is its library support, and in this case, I’m not just talking about whether or not your entire Steam library syncs with your account. While that remains frustrating — a solid 50 percent of my own backlog can’t be played with the service — the upgrade to RTX 5080 hardware is starting off slow. In fact, at launch (and, as a result, during my testing period), only 20 games actually support RTX 5080 machines, with more to come during the service’s usual GFN Thursday updates.\\n\\nThat’s not necessarily a dealbreaker — GeForce Now has certainly collected plenty of fans running on that last-gen hardware, and at least in terms of the games I play, I’m not sure I would’ve immediately noticed the difference in performance if I wasn’t specifically looking for 5080-supported titles. In these early days, though, it would be nice for Nvidia to specifically denote games that run on Blackwell. For now, here’s the list:\\n\\nApex Legends\\n\\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows\\n\\nBaldur’s Gate 3\\n\\nBlack Myth: Wukong\\n\\nBorderlands 4 (at launch)\\n\\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33\\n\\nCounter-Strike 2\\n\\nCronos: The New Dawn\\n\\nCyberpunk 2077\\n\\nDiablo 4\\n\\nDoom: The Dark Ages\\n\\nDune: Awakening\\n\\nDying Light: The Beast\\n\\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered\\n\\nGrounded 2\\n\\nHell Is Us\\n\\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle\\n\\nMafia: The Old Country\\n\\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024\\n\\nOverwatch 2\\n\\nTitan Quest II\\n\\nWarframe\\n\\nThe Witcher 3\\n\\nOverall, I’m pretty impressed with just how good GeForce Now has gotten over the last couple of years. Cloud gaming has had plenty of ups and downs over the last half-decade, but when it comes to Nvidia’s service, it’s really the latency that continues to impress me. The improvements Blackwell is bringing to the table should continue to keep GeForce Now at the top of the list when it comes to the overall experience, but they’ll need to keep delivering upgraded games at a relatively quick pace to do it.',\n",

       "  'content': \"Nvidia’s modding platform for retrofitting classic games with ray tracing has just had a huge overhaul. On September 9, Nvidia announced major updates to RTX Remix, including an “advanced path-traced particle system” that adds real-time particle effects like fire and smoke with full lighting and animation controls, without touching the original game engine.\\n\\nThe new particle system was introduced in a standalone update to RTX Remix available through the Nvidia app. Fundamentally, the GPU particle simulation behaves like a native part of the ray-traced world, with particles casting and receiving shadows, reflecting in surfaces, and responding to both physics and the camera.\\n\\nWith the update, Nvidia is giving modders the kind of visual effects tools that are usually reserved for modern game engines. The company claims that “tens of thousands” of path-traced particles can be rendered “without significantly reducing performance.”\\n\\nThat’s a bold claim that’s likely to draw scrutiny. In previous RTX Remix projects like Portal RTX , particle-heavy scenes have pushed high-end GPUs to their limits , even with DLSS enabled. While Nvidia explicitly recommends RTX 30-series cards as the baseline for an acceptable experience, some players with 3090-class GPUs reported dips well below 60 fps in particle-heavy scenes.\\n\\nNVIDIA RTX Remix | Half-Life 2 RTX Fire Particles - YouTube Watch On\\n\\nThe updates also introduce a more streamlined authoring workflow. Modders can now tag textures in-game as particle emitters via the Alt+X developer menu and tweak properties like size and color directly within the Remix UI. The more advanced Remix Toolkit adds scripting support for lighting behaviors and collision physics powered by PhysX in the backend, according to Nvidia’s documentation .\\n\\nNvidia says that over 165 games are compatible with RTX Remix, provided they use DX8 or DX9 with fixed-function pipeline. That still leaves plenty of room for quirks like potential crashes and rendering issues in some titles, but there’s no denying that RTX Remix is becoming a more powerful and practical tool by the month for modders committed to rebuilding classic games.\\n\\nSince its release, the RTX Remix community has breathed new life into classic games like Half-Life 2, Need for Speed Underground, and Deux Ex, with more than 2 million downloads to date.\\n\\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

I booted up Cyberpunk 2077 to try out this mode on a MacBook Air, immediately cranking the graphics as high as they can go. It was locked at 60 fps. Despite a much lower frame rate than what I saw in Silksong, my latency still hovered between 35 and 40 milliseconds. The feel was spot-on; the quality, however, wasn't perfect.\\n\\nIt's almost as if Nvidia is pushing too much data through the pipeline. You can tell the extra visual quality is there, but on a high-resolution display sitting close to your face, the finer details are lost in what feels like a faint layer of frosted glass. If you're a couple of feet away (or even better, sitting on a couch with GeForce Now on your TV), you won't be able to tell. Up close and personal, the seams become more obvious.\\n\\nOutside of Cinematic quality, the RTX 5080 comes with Nvidia's DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG). It can generate up to three frames for every rendered frame, and I found it particularly useful in games that are a little more demanding but still competitive, like Marvel Rivals.\\n\\nMFG introduces additional latency, which I assumed would be a death sentence in the context of GeForce Now.

It’s not the first time Klarna’s success has created ultrarich employees—at least 115 of its workers have hit seven-figure net worths since 2021. And staffers at other tech companies, including Nvidia, Canva, and Palantir, who invested early have also made it into the exclusive wealth club.\\n\\nMany might think that only savvy investors, pioneering founders, and rising CEOs become millionaires overnight—but employees are reaping seven-figure net worths from the successes of their companies, too. Three dozen lucky Klarna staffers just joined the ultrarich club thanks to its recent stock windfall.\\n\\nKlarna made its New York stock market trading debut this week, with shares skyrocketing after the fintech company and its backers raised $1.37 billion in an initial public offering (IPO). The business’s shares shot up as much as 43% on Wednesday, opening at $52 a share and closing at around $45.82 each, well above the IPO price of $40 ahead of the listing. This shot up Klarna’s market cap to a whopping $17 billion—and it’s estimated that the stock surge catapulted more than 40 current and former Klarna staffers up into the millionaires’ club, thanks to its employee stock perks.\\n\\nOf course, the fintech company’s cofounders, Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Victor Jacobsson, had the most to gain from the debut. Despite leaving the company in 2012, Jacobsson still held on to 31.4 million shares valued at $1.1 billion at the time of the IPO—and will reportedly sell 2.5% of them.\\n\\nMeanwhile, CEO Siemiatkowski owns 25.6 million shares with a value of $920 million.

       "  'content': 'La-Proteina: Atomistic Protein Generation via Partially Latent Flow Matching\\n\\nAbstract. Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations. Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover, La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples, demonstrating La-Proteina\\'s scalability and robustness.\\n\\nFind the Model Card++ for La-Proteina here.\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nFor environment setup mamba or micromamba is recommended, but alternatively conda can also be used as a drop-in replacement (substitute mamba with conda ).\\n\\nmamba env create -f environment.yaml mamba activate laproteina_env pip install torch==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 pip install graphein==1.7.7 --no-deps pip install torch_geometric torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+cu118.html\\n\\nPlease download all model checkpoints into the ./checkpoints_laproteina directory, as indicated in the Checkpoints section, which is necessary to sample our models.\\n\\nIf you are only interested in sampling our models, please go to Sampling our models.\\n\\nTo train models and use our minimal dataloaders, create a file .env in the root directory of the repo with the single line\\n\\nDATA_PATH=/directory/where/you/want/dataset\\n\\nIn the paper we train our models on subsets of the AFDB. We provide lists of IDs for each dataset in laproteina_afdb_ids.zip.\\n\\nDataloaders\\n\\nWe provide minimal dataloader implementations that allow training on different subsets of the PDB. Here we describe how to use these minimal dataloaders. Note that all our models are trained on subsets of the AFDB, not on the PDB, as described in the paper. We provide the indices of the AFDB used for the datasets described in the paper here.\\n\\nPDB dataloader\\n\\nTo use the PDB dataloader, you can for example use the pdb_train_ucond.yaml file, which we provide as part of our configs/dataset/pdb directory, in the following way:\\n\\nimport os import hydra import lightning as L L.seed_everything(43) version_base = hydra.__version__ config_path = </path/to/datasets_configs> hydra.initialize_config_dir(config_dir=f\"{config_path}/pdb\", version_base=version_base) cfg = hydra.compose( config_name=\"pdb_train\", return_hydra_config=True, ) pdb_datamodule = hydra.utils.instantiate(cfg.datamodule) pdb_datamodule.prepare_data() pdb_datamodule.setup(\"fit\") pdb_train_dataloader = pdb_datamodule.train_dataloader()\\n\\nWith this, the dataloader selects all PDB chains according to the selection criteria specified in the yaml file, downloads, processes and splits the data and generates ready-to-use dataloaders and datamodules. For simple demonstration we subsample the dataset in pdb_train_ucond.yaml via the fraction attribute; for the full dataset change this value to 1.\\n\\nModel training\\n\\nVAE training\\n\\nRun the command python proteinfoundation/partial_autoencoder/train.py . Certain parameters, such as KL weight use for the loss, how often to save checkpoints, wandb logging, etc, can be controlled from configs/training_ae.yaml .\\n\\nUnconditional training\\n\\nRun the command python proteinfoundation/train.py . This will start training according to the configuration specified in configs/training_local_latents.yaml , specifying the autoencoder checkpoint, and the neural network config (for unconditional models use - nn: local_latents_score_nn_160M ), learning rate, among other parameters.\\n\\nMotif-scaffolding partially latent flow matching training\\n\\nTraining indexed all-atom vs. indexed tip-atom scaffolding models. For indexed all-atom scaffolding, set the dataset, line 11 of configs/training_local_latents.yaml , to - dataset: pdb/pdb_train_motif_aa , and the neural network, line 12 of configs/training_local_latents.yaml , to - nn: local_latents_score_nn_160M_motif_idx_aa . For indexed tip-atom scaffolding, set them to - dataset: pdb/pdb_train_motif_tip and - nn: local_latents_score_nn_160M_motif_idx_tip .\\n\\nTraining unindexed all-atom vs. unindexed tip-atom scaffolding models. Set the architecture, line 12 of configs/training_local_latents.yaml , to - nn: local_latents_score_nn_160M_motif_uidx (all-atom and tip-atom use the same neural network in the unindexed case). For unindexed all-atom scaffolding, set the dataset, line 11 of configs/training_local_latents.yaml , to - dataset: pdb/pdb_train_motif_aa . For indexed tip-atom scaffolding, set them to - dataset: pdb/pdb_train_motif_tip and - nn: local_latents_score_nn_160M_motif_idx_tip .\\n\\nOnce the config is modified accordingly, run python proteinfoundation/train.py .\\n\\nTraining/Sampling with compiled models\\n\\nSince our transformer-based architecture is amenable to hardware optimizations, we leverage the torch compilation framework to speed up training and inference. This feature is by default disabled in this repository, but can be enabled easily:\\n\\nFor sampling, just outcomment the torch.compile line in the forward method in proteinfoundation/nn/local_latents_transformer.py and proteinfoundation/nn/local_latents_transformer_unindexed.py .\\n\\nline in the forward method in and . For training, in addition you need to enable the PaddingTransform with the appropriate max_size argument to make all batches the same length across the sequence dimension. By default, we only pad the batches to the longest sequence in the batch for efficiency reasons, but to leverage compilation this size should be constant.\\n\\nSampling\\n\\nCheckpoints\\n\\nLa-Proteina consists of two models, the autoencoder and the latent diffusion. All checkpoints should be downloaded and placed in the directory ./checkpoints_laproteina in the codebase\\'s root directory. The code loads checkpoints from this directory automatically. All checkpoints can be found here. We also provide individual links below.\\n\\nWe provide weights for the following latent diffusion models (for autoencoders see next paragraph):\\n\\n(LD1) Unconditional generation, no triangular update layers, generation up to 500 residues: LD1_ucond_notri_512.ckpt.\\n\\n(LD2) Unconditional generation, triangular multiplicative update layers, generation up to 500: LD2_ucond_tri_512.ckpt.\\n\\n(LD3) Unconditional generation, no triangular update layers, generation between 300 and 800 residues: LD3_ucond_notri_800.ckpt.\\n\\n(LD4) Indexed atomistic motif scaffolding, all atom: LD4_motif_idx_aa.ckpt.\\n\\n(LD5) Indexed atomistic motif scaffolding, tip atom: LD5_motif_idx_tip.ckpt.\\n\\n(LD6) Unindexed atomistic motif scaffolding, all atom: LD6_motif_uidx_aa.ckpt.\\n\\n(LD7) Unindexed atomistic motif scaffolding, tip atom: LD7_motif_uidx_tip.ckpt.\\n\\nEach La-Proteina model requires an autoencoder in addition to the latent diffusion model. We provide three different autoencoder checkpoints since each one is trained for proteins of different lengths: up to 256 residues for atomistic motif scaffolding, up to 512 residues for unconditional generation up to 500 residues, and up to 896 residues for unconditional generation of longer chains:\\n\\n(AE1) Autoencoder for unconditional generation up to 500 residues, which should be used with models (LD1, LD2): AE1_ucond_512.ckpt.\\n\\n(AE2) Autoencoder for unconditional generation between 300 and 800 residues, which should be used with model (LD3): AE2_ucond_800.ckpt.\\n\\n(AE3) Autoencoder for atomistic motif scaffolding, which should be used with model (LD4, LD5, LD6, LD7): AE3_motif.ckpt.\\n\\nSampling different configurations\\n\\nWe provide config files and commands to sample our different models. All models can be sampled by running\\n\\npython proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name <config_name>\\n\\nfor the corresponding config file.\\n\\nUnconditional generation:\\n\\nUnconditional samples from the LD1 model: Run python proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name inference_ucond_notri . This will use noise scales of 0.1 for the alpha carbon atoms and 0.1 for the latent variables, and will produce 100 samples for each of the lengths in [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]. These values can be changed in the config file configs/generation/uncod_codes.yaml .\\n\\nUnconditional samples from the LD2 model: Run python proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name inference_ucond_tri . This will use noise scales of 0.1 for the alpha carbon atoms and 0.1 for the latent variables, and will produce 100 samples for each of the lengths in [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]. These values can be changed in the config file configs/generation/uncod_codes.yaml .\\n\\nUnconditional samples from the LD3 model: Run python proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name inference_ucond_notri_long . This will use noise scales of 0.15 for the alpha carbon atoms and 0.05 for the latent variables, and will produce 100 samples for each of the lengths in [300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800]. These values can be changed in the config file configs/generation/uncod_codes_800.yaml .\\n\\nConditional generation: We provide models for atomistic motif scaffolding for four different setups: indexed all-atom, indexed tip-atom, unindexed all-atom, unindexed tip-atom. Please check the paper for precise descriptions of each setup. The lists of atomistic motif scaffolding tasks can be found in configs/generation/motif_dict.yaml , where you\\'ll also find the specification (contig string) for each task. Tasks ending with the \"_TIP\" suffix should be used for tip-atom scaffolding models (indexed and unindexed), and tasks without the \"_TIP\" suffix in their names should be used for the all-atom scaffolding models. Note that the following four tasks (indexed all-atom, indexed tip-atom, unindexed all-atom, unindexed tip-atom) require some small changes in the codebase, as indicated below for each specific case. These changes involve how to map motif residues to sequence indices (different in indexed vs. unindexed) or how the exact features used as input to the model are built.\\n\\nConditional samples from the LD4 model, indexed and all-atom atomistic motif scaffolding: Run python proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name inference_motif_idx_aa . This will use a temperature of 0.1 for the alpha carbon atoms and 0.1 for the latent variables. The motif task can be specified in the config file configs/inference_motif_idx_aa.yaml , and the number of samples produced in the configs/generation/motif.yaml file. This model should be used for all-atom tasks, that is, the ones that do not contain the \"_TIP\" suffix in their name. For this model you need to use lines 1851 and 1852 in proteinfoundation/nn/feature_factory.py , and lines 228 to 230 in ./proteinfoundation/evaluate.py .\\n\\nConditional samples from the LD5 model, indexed and tip-atom atomistic motif scaffolding: Run python proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name inference_motif_idx_tip . This will use a temperature of 0.1 for the alpha carbon atoms and 0.1 for the latent variables. The motif task can be specified in the config file configs/inference_motif_idx_tip.yaml , and the number of samples produced in the configs/generation/motif.yaml file. This model should be used for tip-atom tasks, that is, the ones that contain the \"_TIP\" suffix in their name. For this model you need to use lines 1847 and 1848 in proteinfoundation/nn/feature_factory.py , and lines 228 to 230 in ./proteinfoundation/evaluate.py .\\n\\nConditional samples from the LD6 model, unindexed and all-atom atomistic motif scaffolding: Run python proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name inference_motif_uidx_aa . This will use a temperature of 0.1 for the alpha carbon atoms and 0.1 for the latent variables. The motif task can be specified in the config file configs/inference_motif_uidx_aa.yaml , and the number of samples produced in the configs/generation/motif.yaml file. This model should be used for all-atom tasks, that is, the ones that do not contain the \"_TIP\" suffix in their name. For this model you need to use lines 1851 and 1852 in proteinfoundation/nn/feature_factory.py , and lines 233 to 240 in ./proteinfoundation/evaluate.py .\\n\\nConditional samples from the LD7 model, unindexed and tip-atom atomistic motif scaffolding: Run python proteinfoundation/generate.py --config_name inference_motif_uidx_tip . This will use a temperature of 0.1 for the alpha carbon atoms and 0.1 for the latent variables. The motif task can be specified in the config file configs/inference_motif_uidx_tip.yaml , and the number of samples produced in the configs/generation/motif.yaml file. This model should be used for all-atom tasks, that is, the ones that contain the \"_TIP\" suffix in their name. For this model you need to use lines 1847 and 1848 in proteinfoundation/nn/feature_factory.py , and lines 233 to 240 in ./proteinfoundation/evaluate.py .\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nOur evaluation pipeline requires ProteinMPNN to compute (co-)designability. Running bash script_utils/download_pmpnn_weights.sh in the codebase root directory will download the required weights to the correct location. Note that these weights only needed for the evaluation pipeline, not for sampling our models.\\n\\nWe provide code to compute (co-)designability of the samples produced by our models in proteinfoundation/evaluate.py . For the motif scaffolding tasks it also computes motif RMSD values and motif sequence recovery. Run python proteinfoundation/evaluate.py --config_name <config_name> . Please see this bash script example which can be used to sample some one of our models and evaluate the resulting samples.\\n\\nExplanation of config file parameters\\n\\nThis section briefly explains the multiple parameters in the inference config files. All inference config files are based on configs/experiment_config/inference_base_release.yaml . Then, the config files for the corresponding experiments (e.g. inference_ucond_notri.yaml simply overrides some parameters in the base config). Some of the parameters in these config files are:\\n\\nckpt_name determines the checkpoint for the latent diffusion model. Only requires the checkpoint name, not full path.\\n\\ndetermines the checkpoint for the latent diffusion model. Only requires the checkpoint name, not full path. autoencoder_ckpt_path determines the checkpoint for the autoencoder. Requires full path to checkpoint.\\n\\ndetermines the checkpoint for the autoencoder. Requires full path to checkpoint. self_cond specifies whether to use self-conditioning during sampling. All our evaluations are done with self-conditioning, as we observe that yields better performance.\\n\\nspecifies whether to use self-conditioning during sampling. All our evaluations are done with self-conditioning, as we observe that yields better performance. sc_scale_noise controls the noise scale (for alpha carbon atoms and latent variables, can be set separately).\\n\\nLicense\\n\\nSource code is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

Just know that when I say the service has improved, I mean the service is better at everything it was already great for.\\n\\nIs streaming the future of gaming? No, especially not for multiplayer. But when PC and console prices are more expensive than ever, GeForce Now could fill in the gaps when hardware starts to falter.\\n\\nGeForce Now RTX 5080 Update The performance uplift may not be significant for some games, but GeForce Now makes PC gaming far more accessible. 4 Pros Better performance across multiple games\\n\\nMore resolution options\\n\\nLittle latency\\n\\nBetter graphics in \"cinematic\" mode\\n\\n90Hz support on Steam Deck Cons Visuals can\\'t be be native PC quality\\n\\nPoor for multiplayer\\n\\nMulti-frame gen is pointless over streaming\\n\\nNvidia let me try out its update to GeForce Now early, before it started rolling out to users on Wednesday. It upgrades some games to use a better GPU, dampens server latency, and makes games look better. As much as that sounds like a good deal, let’s remember who is making use of cloud gaming in the first place. Gamers running systems that can’t play today’s AAA games, whether they’re not powerful enough or incompatible altogether, can instead stream the game to their system for the cost of two large artisan coffees each month. That hasn’t changed with the update, but now PC players with a Steam backlog may be able to play far more games using Nvidia’s new Install-to-Play feature.\\n\\nDon’t expect miracles from RTX 5080\\n\\nNvidia’s latest update to GeForce Now allows some games to run on systems with the GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, rather than the last-gen RTX 4080. Not all games support this at launch, though titles that can get performance uplift with the new GPU, including older titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and new games such as Borderlands 4, benefit from extra frame rates and more graphics options. You may find you can push some titles with ray tracing settings that you weren’t able to before. I could get Cyberpunk 2077 running with path tracing enabled for ultra-realistic lighting effects and still have more than enough frame rates that I wasn’t completely relying on digital tricks or so-called “fake frames.”\\n\\nNvidia claims it pushed latency down as much as possible below 30ms to make games feel more seamless. That would be enough to receive my paternalistic nod of approval, but Nvidia also touts the RTX 5080’s multi-frame gen capabilities as a big reason why users should jump on the streaming bandwagon. This is an RTX 50-series Blackwell-exclusive software feature that inserts multiple generated—aka “fake”—frames in between each rendered frame, artificially increasing frame rates for more responsive gameplay. It’s the kind of feature that sounds great on paper, but in practice is more constrained. Users need to achieve more than 50 fps normally to make multi-frame gen work without introducing odd graphical glitches. Frame generation also introduces more latency, though Nvidia said it was able to tamp down on sluggishness with some help from its updated SuperPOD servers.\\n\\nI tried games with and without frame gen, and in most cases, I still think gamers can go without. In Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, I pushed it up to beyond 250 fps with 4x frame gen, and the experience didn’t feel any better than without any frame gen running at around 90 fps. The added latency runs counter to smooth frame rates. Plus, 90 fps is more than playable for single-player titles.\\n\\nIf you can afford a 360Hz monitor, which is now supported by GeForce Now, you can probably afford a non-streaming gaming device. And if you’re using a high-refresh-rate display, you’re likely playing multiplayer games. I could jump into Overwatch 2 or Counter-Strike 2 through streaming and about as well as usual (re: awful), but pushing the refresh rate to 360Hz also pares down the resolution to 1080p. Streaming is not the arena for competitive multiplayer. I doubt it ever could be.\\n\\nGeForce Now can’t replace PC gaming… yet\\n\\nI wasn’t as interested in running these games on my usual gaming PC. If you can play these games natively, then there’s no reason you should be spending an extra $20 on top of however much you blow on the next Steam sale. Instead, I wanted to see what happens when using devices like a 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 chip, a Steam Deck, and even an Nvidia Shield set-top box, which—like a spunky grandfather—is still kicking despite its age.\\n\\nNvidia claims it reduced latency enough to enjoy games online or offline, but the real reason you get GeForce Now is to play your games without spending money on new hardware. Streaming is notorious for introducing odd visuals into high-fidelity 3D games. To remedy this, Nvidia introduced a new “Cinematic” quality mode that enhances colors and sharpens certain objects, like trees. This means a game like Assassin’s Creed: Shadows appears sharper than it did in previous versions of GeForce Now. The extra visual quality was enough to entice me to put a few more hours into a game I had already harangued back at launch.\\n\\nI took screenshots of both Baldur’s Gate III and Cyberpunk 2077 running natively and streaming on my 14-inch MacBook Pro. There are obvious quality differences between the two, plus Nvidia’s base HDR settings result in an overall darker image than natively. It’s a fully playable experience, but I still noticed a loss in detail on some terrain in Baldur’s Gate III and fuzz,y far-distant objects in Cyberpunk 2077.\\n\\nOf course, I was getting better frame rates through GeForce Now than playing each game on a MacBook Pro with M4 chip. For single player games, the latency never became a problem on my home Wi-Fi. Packet loss, where data goes missing moving between your device and the server, is also kept manageable. I do not have the best home Wi-Fi, but in tests, my internet bandwidth usually sits at 75Mbps with a 26ms latency. That’s more than enough for me to stream at 4K and even the new 5K resolution at 120 fps. Other people may not be so lucky to have the 54Mbps minimum required to achieve the highest resolution possible on GeForce Now.\\n\\nGood reminder of what games you own\\n\\nNvidia updated its existing Steam Deck app to play games with support for up to 90Hz refresh rate. Of all the devices I’ve tested with Nvidia’s streaming service, handhelds and other mobile devices are where GeForce Now shines. You can push the resolution in games beyond the Steam Deck’s 800p display, which will help reduce artifacts that pop up from streaming. I can settle down and play from lying down on my bed. Nvidia also released a version of the app for the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS to support 120Hz gaming. That 8.8-inch display and 1200p resolution combine well with an RTX 5080 GPU to offer strong performance across titles. If the SteamOS handhelds are the most console-like devices you can take with you, then GeForce Now makes it so much easier to enjoy games without having to worry nearly as much about frame rate dips or battery life.\\n\\nYou still won’t find titles like Elden Ring available to stream on GeForce Now. However, Nvidia effectively opened up servers for users to download a whole host of new titles. These games remain on the servers until you log off, though you can rent out that space for an extra $3 a month if you want your games to remain.\\n\\nCurrently, Install-to-Play is mostly filled with the kind of older games or indie titles that don’t normally require much graphical power, which in turn means they don’t have enormous file sizes that take hours to download on Nvidia’s remote PCs. Going through the staggering 4,700 titles, you may think there are more games than it’s possible to try. Still, out of the 441 games in my Steam Library, only 15 of them were available through Install-to-Play. That ignores the titles that are fully streaming-ready on the service, which would push the actual number to 359 across my Steam, Epic, and Xbox libraries. Nvidia said it plans to add more games to the service as more developers opt in.\\n\\nDownloading games on these cloud-based PCs didn’t take much hassle. I could already play games like Mark of the Ninja perfectly well on my Steam Deck, but having access to it on my phone, should I want it, is a treat. I only hope Nvidia doesn’t use this feature to eventually dump games that are less played from its official servers, but at least we know we’ll still be able to download them, should that ever happen.\\n\\nGeForce Now is becoming more and more a go-to for me and my personal gaming habits. I enjoy using my Steam Deck at home for playing through Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and then taking the device on the road to run through compatible games like Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader. I’m at a point in my gaming life where my consoles and PCs are like chains that keep me tied to a desk or across a TV. I know the good times can’t last forever, and I’m waiting for the hammer blow of increased subscription costs or the inevitable enshittification that comes to all streaming services.',\n",

       "  'content': 'This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\\n\\nBlank-check mergers are back on the cards — at least for nuclear startups.\\n\\nTerra Innovatum, a company developing micro-modular nuclear reactors, is one of the contenders. It\\'s pursuing a SPAC by merging with GSR III Acquisition Corp, with the aim of raising around $230 million at a $475 million pre-money valuation.\\n\\nIts chief business development officer, Giordano Morichi, told Business Insider that the company is opting for a SPAC because the startup sees it as a smoother alternative to an IPO.\\n\\nMorichi said the startup didn\\'t want to go through a funding round because it \"wanted a more regulated fundraising environment.\"\\n\\nMorichi, who joined the company last year to restrategize its business, has witnessed growing investor appetite for SPACs. He said the transaction\\'s profits would help Terra propel the commercialization of its small-scale nuclear reactor technology.\\n\\nThe team has earmarked around $70 million to build its first unit, a cubic reactor that aims to deliver one megawatt of electricity through its standard fuel rods. The startup anticipates generating this through the listing, which is set for early autumn.\\n\\nThe SPAC process is much faster than that of a traditional IPO, and one that suits a pre-revenue company, said Alex Gadotti, a capital markets advisor at Park Avenue Capital, which is advising Terra Innovatum on the deal. \"It gives much, much more certainty on the proceeds, and the stock gives more control in the process than a normal IPO,\" he added.\\n\\nTerra Innovatum isn\\'t alone in forgoing an IPO. Nuclear upstarts Terrestrial Energy and Eagle Energy Metals are also planning to merge with special purpose acquisition companies.\\n\\nTapping into the SPAC comeback\\n\\nThis year has been something of a turnaround for SPACs, which had their moment in the sun in 2020 before they were marred by challenges and disappointing exits. High-profile listings from 2021, such as BuzzFeed and Grab, plummeted the following year, dipping over 50% in value year on year. Investors became wary.\\n\\nThis year, there\\'s been a steady uptick in SPAC activity. In the US, SPACs raised a total of $11 billion in the first half of 2025, compared with the $2 billion raised in the same period in 2024, per Bloomberg data. Notable listings include Sam Altman-backed nuclear company Oklo\\'s merger with AltC Acquisition Corp, and the upcoming listing of firearms company GrabAGun, which counts Donald Trump Jr. as a board member, merging with Colombier Acquisition Corp. II.\\n\\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\\nSome investors have pointed out the parallels between the electric vehicle SPAC boom of 2021 and the trajectory of nuclear startups today.\\n\\nEV heavyweight Fisker went public via a SPAC in 2020 and later went bankrupt, while ChargePoint has faced financial challenges since its 2021 SPAC.\\n\\nMorichi said that the EV juggernauts that fell from grace post-SPAC had their lofty, multibillion-dollar valuations to blame, but Terra Innovatum\\'s $475 million pre-money valuation is much more \"reasonable\" for investors. The company intends to raise around $230 million, but this is subject to change as it has yet to disclose its pipeline.\\n\\nAI has catalyzed a frenzy for nuclear energy\\n\\nTerra Innovatum is building small-scale nuclear reactors, a technology that\\'s been gaining investor traction as AI juggernauts scramble to power their energy-intensive data centers.\\n\\nCompanies spearheading the AI boom, from Google and Microsoft to Nvidia and OpenAI, have increasingly considered nuclear energy a viable source to meet AI\\'s sky-high energy demands. Amazon took a stake in SMR developer X-Energy last year, while Google struck a nuclear energy deal with Kairos Power. This has given nuclear energy startups a boost as they find a purple patch to scale.\\n\\nTerra\\'s thesis is that energy generation is bottlenecked by energy distribution, and developing micro reactors can tackle both issues.\\n\\n\"Having a reactor that can be next to a factory or hospital can be one of the biggest upsides,\" said Morichi. \"To do so, the reactor needs to be extremely safe. It needs to be small enough so it can\\'t physically explode.\"\\n\\nOften, hydrogen explosions are the key cause of concern in nuclear reactors; the startup uses helium gas as an alternative to hydrogen to minimize this risk.\\n\\nHe added that Terra\\'s micro modular reactors \"can\\'t explode\" because they don\\'t contain water, giving them a higher safety profile.\\n\\nMorichi acknowledges that other SMR companies may yield a higher energy output. But the company\\'s selling point has been its scalability. The reactor\\'s off-grid capability and modular design make it an attractive option for data center companies, he said.\\n\\nThe company is in talks to partner with data center providers, but declined to provide specifics as that information is not yet public.\\n\\nUnlike many clean energy companies dealing with the financial fallout from Donald Trump\\'s \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" the team has actually been emboldened by federal policy that\\'s \"propelling the wind in our sails,\" Morichi told Business Insider. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced it would be cutting fees for the process of licensing and reviewing nuclear projects, which Morichi said would help bring the reactors to market much quicker.\\n\\nIt\\'s also avoided any major bruising from the administration\\'s tariffs that have otherwise hampered supply chains globally. \"We have a seamless model for the supply chain. We have secured part of the supply chain in Italy and in the US, and we have different types of partners that will help on those fronts,\" he added.\\n\\nWhile the listing will be on the Nasdaq, the team ultimately has international ambitions. Energy resilience is not a national issue affecting only the US, but a global problem, Morichi said.\\n\\n\"Because we really want to deploy these reactors globally, it\\'s important that we work with local entities and industries, not only to propel their own economic state value, but to help us enter the market,\" he said.\\n\\nCorrection: September 11, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated who Alex Gadotti works for.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Beijing is souring on Nvidia.\\n\\nChina, which used to be one of Nvidia’s largest markets, seems largely conflicted about reaccepting Nvidia’s lower-tech H20 chips that Trump administration finally allowed to resume sales of in July. The Chinese tech industry might be excited about the Nvidia chip flow resuming, but the government is allegedly not.\\n\\nChinese authorities have discouraged local tech companies from purchasing Nvidia chips citing national security concerns, and even questioned industry titans like Tencent over their purchases of Nvidia chips, according to Reuters.\\n\\nIn response, tech giants like Alibaba and Baidu have begun using their own chips to train smaller AI models, the Information reported on Thursday, but they will reportedly continue to use some Nvidia chips.\\n\\n“The competition has undeniably arrived,” an Nvidia spokesperson told Gizmodo. “Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world’s most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We’ll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere.”\\n\\nChinese development is ramping up. China chip stocks have experienced a major boom so big that the Beijing-based company Cambricon had to warn investors recently. Tech giants like Huawei and Alibaba are leading the push, but smaller companies are also making strides.\\n\\nShanghai-based tech company MetaX told the Wall Street Journal last month that it’s preparing to start mass production of a new chip that has bigger memory than Nvidia’s H20.\\n\\nStill, largely no chip offering so far has been considered completely up to par with Nvidia’s best offerings. Reuters reported last week that top Chinese tech firms like Alibaba and ByteDance are still very keen to get their hands on Nvidia chips. That’s despite the fact that the Nvidia chips that are being sold to China are downgraded versions of existing models, developed to abide by U.S. exports restrictions.\\n\\nThe chips saga\\n\\nSome experts in Washington think any supply of American tech to China has sizable national security risks attached to it. They also claim the chips can assist China in outpacing American AI innovation.\\n\\nThe Biden administration was first to enforce export restrictions on Nvidia chips sold to China, in an effort to curb the entry of high-tech chips into China off of those fears.\\n\\nBeijing landed a particularly big blow to domestic AI confidence earlier this year with Deepseek’s R1, an AI model that rivaled the best of American companies offerings using lower cost chips, inadvertently showing Americans that Chinese innovation did not require the top Nvidia chips.\\n\\nThat fueled the blanket ban decision which turned out to be less effective than expected when a Financial Times report found that Nvidia’s highest tech chips were being smuggled into China in the absence of the lower tech H20s.\\n\\nThe decision was also a big hit to Nvidia: executives shared in a May earnings call that they had to revise revenue expectations down for the quarter by about $8 billion due to the restrictions.\\n\\nAfter an intense lobbying effort by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Trump reversed his decision in July, allowing H20 chips sales to China. In exchange, Trump demanded that Nvidia, and fellow American chipmaker AMD, both give the U.S. government a 15% cut of all of their chips revenue in China.\\n\\nJust when Nvidia thought all was finally well, Beijing started raising concerns about the new Nvidia chips coming into China having kill switches and backdoors, urging Chinese companies to not use them. Nvidia has denied the claim.\\n\\nThe remaining political uncertainty has continued to cast a shadow on Nvidia’s performance in China. The company conceded in its latest earnings call that they were facing disappointing numbers from the region still and were yet to begin H20 shipments.\\n\\nWhy did Beijing change its mind?\\n\\nChina has a long relationship with Nvidia. The downturn in that relationship began after the first export restrictions went into effect, ramped up after an antitrust probe in December and has developed a life of its own under Trump’s trade war.\\n\\nChinese officials have voiced security concerns related to the latest round of chips set to enter the country, but this attitude change has less to do with Nvidia itself and more about China’s own chip industry.\\n\\nChinese AI industry is currently dependent on American chipmakers like Nvidia, and that gives Americans an edge. In the absence of Nvidia chips, China will have to develop their own high-tech chips that can rival and even surpass the quality of Nvidia chips. If that happens, the United States can be at jeopardy to lose its hold on the global chips demand, and China is the runner-up.\\n\\nThe country is making a big bet on AI, announcing an $8.2 billion AI-investment fund earlier this year, in an effort to spur innovation and reach independence.\\n\\n“It’s unfortunate to see that we in Asia, including China, are emulating the U.S. when it comes to developing algorithms and large models,” Wei Shaojun, an adviser to senior Chinese government officials and a professor at top Beijing university Tsinghua University told a forum in Singapore on Thursday. He warned that staying on this path of dependence could be “lethal” for the region, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nAlong with the chips push, the country has increasingly emphasized global cooperation in AI, and center to that initiative is Beijing’s desire to cement itself at the center of the global AI trade.\\n\\nIt seems China is coming to terms with the fact that aspiration won’t be achievable as long as the industry is dependent on the U.S. for chips, especially when Washington has demonstrated that its trade policy decisions are volatile.',\n",

       " {'headline': 'Chinese scientists claim to have built the first \"brain-like\" AI model — said to be up to 100 times faster than ChatGPT',\n",
       "  'content': 'In the mid-20th Century, we had the Space Race kick off, and in the mid-2020s, we\\'re very much in the middle of the AI race. Nobody is sitting still, with parties all around the globe pushing for the next big advancements.\\n\\nChinese scientists are now making a big claim to have made one of their own. As reported by The Independent, SpikingBrain1.0 is a new large language model (LLM) out of China, which ordinarily might not be so exciting. But this isn\\'t supposed to be any normal LLM. SpikingBrain1.0 is reported to be as much as 100x faster than current models such as those behind ChatGPT and Copilot.\\n\\nAll down to the way the model operates, which is something completely new. It\\'s being touted as the first \"brain-like\" LLM, but what does that actually mean? First, a little background on how the current crop of LLMs work.\\n\\nThe current crop of LLMs work very differently to what\\'s claimed of SpikingBrain1.0 (Image credit: Windows Central)\\n\\nBear with me on this one, hopefully I can make it make sense and as simply as possible. Essentially, the current crop of LLMs look at all of the words in a sentence at once. They\\'re looking for patterns, relationships between words, whatever their position in the sentence.\\n\\nIt uses a method known as Attention. Take a sentence such as this:\\n\\n\"The Baseball player swung the bat and hit a home run.\"\\n\\nYou, as a human, read that sentence and instantly know what it means, because your brain immediately associates \"Baseball\" with the words that come after it. But to an LLM, the word \"bat\" on its own could be both a baseball bat or the animal. Without examining the rest of the sentence, it wouldn\\'t be able to make that differentiation.\\n\\nAttention in an LLM will look at the whole sentence and then map out relationships between the words to understand it. It will identify the other terms, such as \"swung\" and \"baseball player,\" to identify the correct definition and make better predictions.\\n\\nThis connects with the training data for the LLM, where it will have learned that \"baseball\" and \"bat\" often go together.\\n\\nThe new model has been developed to rely not on NVIDIA hardware, running on homegrown chips from MetaX.

This, in part, is why current LLMs generally need massive amounts of computing power. Every word is compared to every other word, and it consumes a lot of resources.\\n\\nSpikingBrain1.0 claims to mimic the human brain\\'s approach, focusing only on nearby words, similar to how we would approach a sentence\\'s context. A brain fires the nerve cells it needs to; it doesn\\'t run at full power all of the time.\\n\\nThe net result is a more efficient process, with its creators claiming between 25x and 100x performance gains over current LLMs. Compared to something such as ChatGPT, this model is supposed to selectively respond to inputs, reducing its resource requirements to operate.\\n\\nAs written in the research paper:\\n\\n\"This enables continual pre-training with less than 2 percent of the data while achieving performance comparable to mainstream open-source models.”\\n\\nPerhaps equally interesting, at least for China, is that the model has been built not to rely on GPU compute from NVIDIA hardware. It has been tested on a locally produced chip from a Chinese company, MetaX.\\n\\nCould SpikingBrain1.0 lead to a path where we need less of these to power AI? (Image credit: Windows Central | Ben Wilson)\\n\\nThere is, of course, much to be considered, but on paper at least, SpikingBrain1.0 could be a logical next evolution of LLMs. Much has been made of the impact AI will have on the environment, with vast energy requirements and equally vast requirements to cool these massive data centers.\\n\\nIt\\'s bad enough running LLMs in Ollama at home with an RTX 5090. My office gets hot, and with a graphics card that can draw close to 600W, it\\'s hardly efficient. Scale that thought up to a data center full of GPUs.\\n\\nThis is an interesting development if it all pans out to be accurate. It could be the next leap forward, but only if the balance of accuracy and efficiency is there. Exciting times for sure, though.',\n",

       " {'headline': 'Borderlands 4 Dev Gearbox Asks PC Gamers to Keep Playing for at Least 15 Minutes After They Tweak Settings to See How Performance Has Changed, as Negative Steam Reviews Pile Up',\n",
       "  'content': 'Borderlands 4 has launched on Steam to big concurrent player numbers, but the release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform.\\n\\nBorderlands 4 peaked at 207,479 concurrent player numbers on Steam yesterday, September 11, which was significantly higher than any previous Borderlands before it. However, the game launched to ‘mostly negative’ Steam reviews over performance issues and crashing, before recovering overnight to ‘mixed.’\\n\\nThe complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.\\n\\n“Terrible optimization. Another Unreal Engine 5 casualty. Not worth buying in its current state unless you have a NASA PC,” said one person in a negative review.\\n\\n“Terrible, terrible performance. Worst I\\'ve ever seen. Turned it down to Low graphics presets and couldn\\'t hit 60 FPS, even with FSR upscaling on my RX 6900 XT,” said another.\\n\\nIn response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on Steam, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.\\n\\n“As PC gamers begin their Vault-hunting journeys in Borderlands 4, we\\'ve seen early feedback from the community surrounding graphics settings and how to achieve optimal performance,” Gearbox said, before outlining the “expected results” for the Borderlands 4 PC specs:\\n\\nMinimum PC specs - 1080p @ 30FPS with Low Preset settings\\n\\nRecommended PC specs - 1440p @ 60FPS with Medium Preset settings\\n\\nGearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game\\'s performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC\\'s performance has changed.”\\n\\nGearbox went on to show the “Optimal Settings” charts provided by Nvidia with suggestions for which graphics settings may work best for your combination of GPU and desired display resolution. Meanwhile, it recommended using the Nvidia app to download and install Nvidia’s newest Game Ready Driver (581.29) and “optimize for your system.” If all else fails, “please contact 2K Support for direct assistance.”\\n\\nBorderlands 4 Review Screenshots View 159 Images\\n\\nGearbox and publisher 2K Games will be keen to address the performance complaints early, given the impact negative reviews on Steam can have on a video game’s success. Ahead of launch, Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford had said the Borderlands 4 Day 1 patch “does a lot,” amid concern about the performance of the looter shooter. Pitchford had responded to concern about Borderlands 4’s pre-release performance on PC from some users on X / Twitter.\\n\\nDespite the Day 1 patch, playing Borderlands 4 on older hardware won\\'t miraculously unlock \"buttery smooth performance,\" Pitchford added. It should be expected that Borderlands 4 is “unplayable” if you’re trying to use a PC below min-spec, he said, and, generally, playing new AAA games on older hardware won\\'t achieve impressive results.\\n\\nHere’s Pitchford\\'s comment in full:\\n\\nThe Day 1 patch does a lot! That said, the expectation for using a below min-spec machine should be that the game is unplayable. That the game runs at all on your system is a miracle. That you can get 55 - 60 fps out of heavy combat is actually incredible given how the engine and what\\'s going on under the hood. Your specification doesn\\'t indicate if you\\'re on SDD or HDD, but that could also explain some of the hitching. It\\'s a big, bold, new, seamless world and I\\'m sorry to say that older hardware may not provide buttery smooth performance for the latest gen AAA games, as has always been the case since the dawn of PC gaming.\\n\\nAs a reminder, here are Borderlands 4’s PC specs:\\n\\nBorderlands 4 System Requirements:\\n\\nMinimum:\\n\\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\\n\\nOS: Windows 10 / Windows 11\\n\\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X\\n\\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\\n\\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580\\n\\nStorage: 100 GB available space\\n\\nAdditional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.

       " {'headline': 'I tried the new recommended settings for Borderlands 4 and oh no, they don’t actually fix its stuttering',\n",
       "  'content': 'It’s been a rough first day at the office for Borderlands 4, which has launched amid spyware denials and widespread user reports of dodgy PC performance. That being crashing, stuttering, the usual Unreal Engine 5 trouble at the mill. Framerate-related grumbling in particular has prompted a Steam post from Gearbox, presenting a setting-by-setting guide to optimisation on GeForce graphics cards that their pals at Nvidia put together.\\n\\nFirst off, oi, that’s my job. Second, I say \"prompted\", but the sheer number of GPUs it covers – separately for 1080p, 1440p, and 4K resolutions – has produced settings tables so rich in cells that it’s far more likely a sweating intern has spent the entire past week cranking these out. No disrespect, obviously. Solidarity to benchmarkers. But, are these guides reliable?\\n\\nLet’s start by taking a my god, look at the size of it.\\n\\nImage credit: 2K\\n\\nMaybe the text version further down the post is more easily readable?\\n\\nImage credit: 2K\\n\\nAh. JPG it is then, where we can see that even at 1080p, Borderlands 4 thinks you should run it with both DLSS upscaling and frame generation. I booted up the RPS Test Rig with an 8GB RTX 4060 Ti, one of the included cards, and settled down in one of the more demanding open world areas for a spot of corroboration.\\n\\nAnd yes, DLSS – or the GPU-supported upscaler of your choosing – is clearly intended as standard procedure. With frame gen disabled and Nvidia’s suggested settings in place, I was averaging 99fps, but switching off Quality-level DLSS and running at native 1080p saw that stoop to 62fps.\\n\\nFrame gen itself, meanwhile, is just weird. It did get my average framerate up to 148fps (visually, anyway – only 90 to 95 of those were \\'real\\' frames) but motion didn’t appear any smoother. In fact, it gained a harsher, grittier quality that didn’t look dissimilar to a lower framerate. I’ve seen this happen with less advanced upscalers like the original FSR 3.0, but never with the new and improved DLSS 4.\\n\\nOtherwise, Gearbox/Nvidia’s settings guide for the RTX 4060 Ti is decent, if a little excessive. I’m not sure it needs such deep cuts to volumetric clouds and the main shadow quality options, both of which produced negligible differences between their highest and lowest settings in my testing. Foliage density, volumetric fog, and directional shadows all have slightly bigger framerate impacts, but I only lost 3-5fps apiece by toggling them to Very High. Which, by the by, is worth trying for foliage, given how bare the game looks without its veggies.\\n\\nImage credit: 2K\\n\\nStill, the guide does correctly identify these as leveraging some level of performance tax, and I’d have to agree with it keeping lighting quality on Low. This is one of the heaviest settings of the bunch, with my RTX 4060 Ti falling from 99fps to 74fps after changing this single setting up to Very High, with surprisingly little gain in terms of visual niceness. Frame gen remains a no-no, but fair dos, you would be getting a more fined-tuned Borderlands 4 with these than any of the presets.\\n\\nUnfortunately, a good showing for Gearbox’s big Excel project ultimately doesn’t truly address its performance problems. I haven’t had any crashes yet but stuttering is, indeed, a common occurrence, especially during big fights where multiple baddies are onscreen and some manner of elemental particle effect tornado is blowing through them. Which, this being a Borderlands game, is most fights. Although higher framerates can help mask the effect, it doesn’t seem that you can completely stutter-proof your PC, even with pre-tailored settings recommendations.\\n\\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, it doesn’t pay to try skirting under the system requirements. I had a cheeky go on my RTX 4050 laptop, the 8GB system RAM and 6GB VRAM of which come under the official minimums, and even DLSS wasn’t enough to stay above 30fps in the open world. With, naturally, plenty of big stutters along the way.\\n\\nWhether you’re playing Borderlands 4 or not, we’re all uncomfortably familiar with the problem at this point. It’s one that’s frayed the edges of games, unusual Unreal Engine 5 ones, from recent releases Wuchang: Fallen Feathers and Dune: Awakening back to the likes of Remnant II and beyond. We also know by now, as Gearbox and 2K should, that it’s not something that can be fixed on our end by changing a few settings.',\n",

(Of course you have.) According to a recent Tesla filing, the startup\\'s full name is \"eXploratory Artificial Intelligence.\" There\\'s just one problem: Neither Musk nor xAI appears to have publicly said that\\'s the case.\\n\\nIn today\\'s big story, companies\\' push to get employees back to the office includes looking at the data. It\\'s working better for some (Microsoft) more than others (AT&T).\\n\\nWhat\\'s on deck:\\n\\nMarkets: Forget \"Equities in Dallas,\" Wall Street is investing big in its Texas offices.\\n\\nTech: Microsoft wants to show it can do AI all by itself.\\n\\nBusiness: Flip wanted to take on TikTok.

A system meant to track the hours workers actually spend in the office is causing more headaches than it\\'s worth, reports BI\\'s Dominick Reuter.\\n\\nAT&T chief marketing and growth officer Kellyn Kenny told employees last month she understands inaccuracies in the attendance tracking tool are \"driving people to the brink of frustration.\"\\n\\nIn case you aren\\'t dialed in to what\\'s going on at AT&T, here\\'s a refresher. AT&T required people to return to the office five days a week at the beginning of the year. The rollout didn\\'t go smoothly, with everything from parking spots to desks filling up quickly. Things seemed to come to a head last month when CEO John Stankey sent a memo telling workers to get on board with RTO or get out of the way.\\n\\nAT&T\\'s attendance tracker was meant to suss out people abusing the system by swiping into the office only for a few hours, known as \"coffee-badging.\" To catch those \"freeloaders,\" as Kenny described them, the company set up benchmarks around the number of hours and days workers were to badge in.\\n\\nBut the data wasn\\'t always perfect. Routine things — attending doctors\\' appointments, taking lunch — complicated matters.\\n\\nIn some cases, AT&T\\'s attendance tracker backfired. If the company wanted eight hours a day, workers wondered, why bother putting in more time than that?\\n\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaking at a conference in San Francisco. Carlos Barria/REUTERS\\n\\nMeanwhile, another corner of the business world is touting its RTO data.\\n\\nMicrosoft executives told employees at an all-employee town hall that internal data shows workers spending more time in the office are \"thriving,\" writes BI\\'s Ashley Stewart.\\n\\nThe data comes after Microsoft announced its RTO plans.\\n\\nMicrosoft HR chief Amy Coleman said people who spend at least three days in the office, which is Microsoft\\'s new RTO mandate, are energized, empowered, and find meaning in their work.\\n\\nHowever, CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged the importance of maintaining some flexibility with work, according to internal comments at the town hall reviewed by Ashley.\\n\\n\"There\\'s tons of empowerment here for people to go organize this in such a way that it works for the folks,\" Nadella said.\\n\\n3 things in markets\\n\\nInside a Trader Joe\\'s store in Miami Beach, Florida. Jeff Greenberg/Getty Images\\n\\n1. Inflation came in as hot as expected. CPI data showed inflation in August ticked up to 2.9%, up from 2.7% in June and July. The new numbers have had little effect on the Fed\\'s likelihood of cutting rates next week, which traders and economists still expect to happen.\\n\\n2. Nvidia has finally won over one of Wall Street\\'s biggest skeptics. DA Davidson changed its rating on the chip giant\\'s stock from \"neutral\" to \"buy,\" raising its price target from $195 to $210 a share. The firm cited rapid development and AI adoption among companies for its flipped perspective.\\n\\n3. Everything\\'s bigger in Texas — even the banks.

See what they\\'re up to out west.\\n\\n3 things in tech\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\n1. US data center construction breaks new ground. Thanks to ever-rising demand from AI, spending on data center construction hit $40 billion annually in June, up 28% from the year before. That\\'s a new record, and it shows no signs of slowing: Big Tech\\'s spree could total more than $1 trillion by 2028.\\n\\n2. Oh great, now there\\'s AI \"psychosis risk\" to worry about. Wall Street is beginning to evaluate AI chatbots and models based on \"psychosis risk,\" or the tendency of the bot to exacerbate user mental health problems. A recent study showed stark differences between the models that mitigate risk and those that amplify it, leaving analysts concerned.\\n\\n3. It looks like Microsoft might be trying to forge its own AI path. The company is planning \"significant investments\" in its own AI chip cluster, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said in an all-employee town hall meeting. Microsoft appears to be drifting apart from OpenAI, with Suleyman saying it should be \"self-sufficient\" in the sector.\\n\\n3 things in business\\n\\nFlip; Tyler Le/BI\\n\\n1. A TikTok challenger\\'s mysterious demise. Video app Flip looked primed to take over TikTok\\'s dominance in mid-January amid mounting regulatory pressure. Seven months later, the $1 billion company was dead. Former employees, investors, creators, and more told BI how it flew and then flopped.\\n\\n2. David Ellison means business. Paramount\\'s reported bid for Warner Bros. Discovery shows the Paramount CEO is serious about taking on Netflix and Disney for Hollywood\\'s crown. It doesn\\'t hurt that he has the financial backing of his father, Larry Ellison, who briefly became the richest man in the world this week.\\n\\n3. America\\'s oldest workers are taking pay cuts. As part of BI\\'s \"80 over 80\" series, dozens of older workers told us they earn less than $20 an hour.

       "  'content': 'Kioxia is working with Nvidia to build a solid-state drive that would deliver 100 million random IOPS already in 2027, the company said at a news conference earlier this month, Nikkei reports. Nvidia reportedly plans to use a couple of such SSDs — totalling a whopping 200 million IOPS — attached directly to its GPUs to boost AI performance.\\n\\n\"We will proceed with development in accordance with the proposals and requests from Nvidia,\" said Koichi Fukuda, chief technology officer of Kioxia\\'s SSD division.\\n\\n100 million IOPS SSD\\n\\nKioxia\\'s drives with 100 million random read speeds are projected to use a PCIe 7.0 interface to connect to GPUs in a peer-to-peer mode and will be exclusively designed for use in AI servers that need to access and process vast amounts of data quickly.\\n\\nToday\\'s high-end solid-state drives can deliver around 3 million 4K random IOPS, but to meet the performance needs of modern and upcoming GPUs — which are optimized for burst memory access — they need to get substantially faster and change the way they interact with NAND media.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Silicon Motion\\'s CEO Wallace Kou told Tom\\'s Hardware that Nvidia was interested in building SSDs that offer as many as 100 million random IOPS, 33 times more than existing drives can deliver. Around the same time, Kioxia disclosed plans to build XL-Flash-based \\'AI SSDs\\' with over 10 million 512K random read IOPS in the second half of 2026.\\n\\nAI workloads rely on frequent, small, random reads to retrieve embeddings, model parameters, or database entries. In such cases, 512-byte blocks better represent actual usage patterns than 4KB blocks and provide lower latency. While drives that operate 512B blocks may not deliver the same raw bandwidth as typical SSDs with 4K blocks, it is easier to scale out sequential read/write speeds with multiple drives than to lower the latencies of conventional SSDs.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether Kioxia\\'s AI SSD with a 10 million 512K IOPS random performance will materialize in 2026 if Kioxia plans to build drives with a 100 million IOPS random performance in 2027.\\n\\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom\\'s Hardware Newsletter Get Tom\\'s Hardware\\'s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\\n\\nUsing XL-Flash?\\n\\nWhat is interesting is how exactly Kioxia plans to build its 100 million IOPS drive. Its proposed AI SSD is based on XL-Flash, which is SLC NAND memory with high endurance, very low latency, and fairly high performance. Kioxia\\'s XL-Flash devices feature 16 planes (up significantly from 3 to 6 planes on modern 3D NAND devices for client PCs), which points to higher sequential and random performance. As Kioxia does not publish specifications of XL-Flash, it is impossible to judge the per-device performance of this memory type.\\n\\nMeanwhile, considering that an Innogrit Tacoma-based 400GB XL-Flash SSD with 32 NAND dies (with seven allocated for overprovisioning) and a PCIe 5.0 x4 interface delivers 3.5 million random read IOPS and 0.5 million random write IOPS, we can estimate that each die contributes up to 109,375 random read IOPS and 15,625 random write IOPS—though this calculation comes with some caveats.\\n\\nAssuming perfect linear scaling across loads of NAND devices, a 100 million 512B IOPS SSD would require 915 of such dies (presuming the same levels of over provisioning). Now that Kioxia knows how to pack 32 NAND ICs into a single package, it can certainly build a drive based on 915 XL-Flash ICs (in 28 packages). Such a drive would require a special controller with at least a PCIe 5.0 x16 host interface (though PCIe 7.0 x4 would be more preferable). The problem is, there is no perfect linear scaling. Real-world performance of NAND devices in SSDs is limited by channel bandwidth, multi‑plane constraints, command pipelining/overheads, queue depth, firmware, and loads of other factors. Hence, the best case scenario for a 100 million 512B IOPS SSD featuring XL-Flash devices is a multi-controller module with dozens of controllers and a switch. Such a solution may well make sense in all-flash arrays, but Kioxia is explicitly talking about an SSD.\\n\\nWelcome, HBF?\\n\\nSince using traditional 3D NAND memory for a 100 million IOPS SSD with 512B blocks is not exactly feasible, whereas using a brand-new type of media on a commercial data center-grade product is highly unlikely, Kioxia might instead look to emerging technologies that use NAND memory in an unconventional way.\\n\\nOne of such technologies is probably high bandwidth flash (HBF) that packs up to 16 NAND devices and a logic die (a controller?) into a single stack and interconnects them using TSVs and microbumps. While HBF layers still use proven NAND memory cells, they are organized in multiple arrays to achieve a very high level of parallelism and therefore performance. We do not know whether Kioxia plans to use HBF for the project or stick to something similar. However, it is safe to assume that the knowledge it will gain from its experimentation with HBF to build ultra-high-performance SSDs is something the company intends to leverage.\\n\\nFollow Tom\\'s Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

       " {'headline': 'AI drone swarms revolutionize wildfire detection and air quality monitoring',\n",
       "  'content': 'University of Minnesota researchers have developed AI-powered drone swarms to track wildfire smoke in 3D, offering a better way to predict air pollution. (CREDIT: Shutterstock)\\n\\nFrom the outside, wildfire smoke may look like a drifting gray cloud. But for scientists, these plumes are dynamic, complex, and potentially dangerous. They can stretch for hundreds of miles, impacting air quality, visibility, and public health. Until now, capturing accurate data on how these smoke particles move and behave has been one of the most difficult tasks in atmospheric science.\\n\\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities have developed a groundbreaking way to observe and analyze wildfire smoke: a swarm of AI-powered aerial robots that can detect, track, and build 3D models of smoke plumes.\\n\\nUnlike traditional drones, these small flying machines work as a team. They recognize smoke, fly directly into it, and take high-resolution images from multiple angles. Their mission is to help us better understand how smoke travels—an understanding that could reshape how we predict air pollution and respond to environmental hazards.\\n\\nThis new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science of the Total Environment, opens doors to more accurate fire behavior models and better air quality predictions, not just for wildfires, but also for prescribed burns, volcanic eruptions, sandstorms, and other particle-driven events.\\n\\nA graphical abstract of the study. (CREDIT: Science of The Total Environment)\\n\\nBetween 2012 and 2021, about 50,000 prescribed burns were carried out in the United States—intentional fires set under controlled conditions to improve forest health and reduce wildfire risk. But even controlled burns carry risk. According to a 2024 report by the Associated Press, 43 of these burns spiraled out of control and became wildfires.\\n\\nThese numbers, while small in percentage, matter deeply. That’s because smoke particles, especially the small ones, can stay in the air for days and travel far from their source. “A key step is understanding the composition of smoke particles and how they disperse,” explained Jiarong Hong, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota and senior author of the study. “Smaller particles can travel farther and stay suspended longer, impacting regions far from the original fire.”\\n\\nUnderstanding how these plumes evolve over time is essential for early hazard detection, public health responses, and emergency planning. Yet, traditional tools for studying smoke—like satellites, remote sensing, and Lidar—fall short. These tools lack the detail and flexibility needed to capture fast-changing flows of smoke, especially in rough terrain or remote regions.\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\nThat’s where the new drone swarm steps in. These AI-enabled robots are designed to adapt to the smoke’s size and shape. They gather rich data in real time—something existing technologies can’t do affordably or efficiently.\\n\\nThe Science Behind the Swarm\\n\\nThe team’s drone system includes one manager drone and four worker drones. These drones aren’t just fancy flying cameras—they’re mini laboratories in the sky.\\n\\nEach drone carries a 12-megapixel camera mounted on a three-axis gimbal for capturing smoke in motion. They are powered by long-lasting 6000 mAh batteries and guided by advanced flight controllers and NVIDIA Jetson processors. These processors allow the drones to recognize smoke in real time, adjust their paths, and capture the best angles for imaging.\\n\\nWhen launched, the drones work together to fly around a smoke plume, snapping high-resolution images from multiple directions. These images are then grouped by time intervals and fed into a computer model using something called a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). This advanced AI model helps turn 2D images into a realistic, detailed 3D reconstruction of the smoke plume.\\n\\nIllustration of the drone swarm system that uses multi-view imaging for 3D smoke plume characterization. (CREDIT: Science of The Total Environment)\\n\\nThis step is key. With the 3D model, researchers can analyze the shape, direction, and flow of the smoke over time. It gives them crucial data like volume, angle of movement, and dispersion speed—all critical for improving fire and smoke simulation tools.\\n\\nOther cutting-edge AI techniques were considered, including Dynamic NeRF (D-NeRF) and RoDynRF, which are good at modeling motion. But these systems struggle with featureless subjects like smoke and require long training times. The drone swarm approach avoids those problems by directly capturing the data in the field.\\n\\n“This approach allows for high-resolution data collection across large areas—at a lower cost than satellite-based tools,” said Nikil Nrishnakumar, the study’s first author and a graduate researcher at the Minnesota Robotics Institute.\\n\\nFrom Research to Real-World Impact\\n\\nThe drone swarm has already been tested in field deployments and has shown promising results. With this system, the team can generate multiple 3D reconstructions over time, creating a time-lapse view of how a smoke plume changes in real-time. It’s like watching the plume evolve in 3D—a powerful tool for scientists and emergency responders.\\n\\nDrone hardware configuration showing the quadcopter with camera mounted on a 3-axis gimbal and GPS with RTK (left), and the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (right). (CREDIT: Science of The Total Environment)\\n\\nBut the benefits of this technology reach far beyond wildfire science.\\n\\n“Early identification is key,” Hong emphasized. “The sooner you can see the fire, the faster you can respond.”\\n\\nThe drones could be used in other dangerous scenarios as well, including volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and even urban pollution events. Because the system is modular and cost-effective, it can be scaled up or down based on the size of the area being studied. This flexibility makes it a strong candidate for use by government agencies, environmental researchers, and emergency crews.\\n\\nThe next steps for the team involve making the system more autonomous and scalable. They’re now integrating fixed-wing drones with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capability. These new drones can fly longer distances—over an hour at a time—and don’t need a runway to take off. That opens the door to monitoring vast forests and hard-to-reach locations.\\n\\nIn addition, the team plans to explore Digital Inline Holography to improve particle characterization. This method could provide even deeper insights into what types of particles are present in a smoke plume and how they interact with the environment.\\n\\n“We’re not just building tools,” Nrishnakumar said. “We’re laying the groundwork for smarter, faster, and safer responses to environmental hazards.”\\n\\nFlowcharts detailing the steps involved in (a) stabilizing the manager drone, (b) collecting data with the worker drone swarm, and (c) processing captured data for 3D plume reconstruction and characterization. (CREDIT: Science of The Total Environment)\\n\\nA New Era of Smoke Science\\n\\nMany modern simulation tools like FIRETEC and QUIC-Fire already exist to model how fires spread and how smoke particles behave. These systems use complex inputs—everything from fuel type and moisture to wind speed and topography. But even the best models have one major limitation: they need real-world data to validate their predictions.\\n\\nThat’s why the drone swarm matters so much. It provides the missing piece—real, time-sensitive, high-resolution data that can make these simulations more accurate and useful.\\n\\nUntil now, simulation models have struggled to work in areas without detailed 3D maps of vegetation and terrain. They also haven’t been able to compare their predictions with real-world smoke movement, especially in complex or fast-changing environments. The drone swarm changes that by creating accurate 3D ground truth models that can be used for comparison and refinement.\\n\\nAs the climate warms and wildfire risks rise, these tools may become vital to protecting both ecosystems and human health. With more than 40% of the U.S. population living in areas prone to wildfire smoke, this research couldn’t come at a better time.\\n\\nThis project was supported by the National Science Foundation’s Major Research Instrumentation program and conducted with the help of the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Along with Hong and Nrishnakumar, the research team included Shashank Sharma and Srijan Kumar Pal, also from the Minnesota Robotics Institute.\\n\\nNote: The article above provided above by The Brighter Side of News.',\n",

       "  'content': \"In the past few months at Intel between layoffs / corporate reorganizations and some deciding to pursue job opportunities elsewhere, there have been unfortunate impacts to their Linux engineering resources. Intel over the summer lost some prominent Linux engineering talent and in turn has even led to upstream Linux drivers being orphaned along with other driver maintainers departing and various other staffing changes . Unfortunate for Intel, another notable Linux name has left the company.Colin Ian King announced today that it was his last day at Intel. Colin King had just been employed by Intel for nearly four years but is well known prior to then. Prior to joining Intel, Colin was a kernel engineer at Canonical where he worked on Ubuntu Linux for over 13 years. Colin King was well known for his Ubuntu Linux work and has contributed more than four thousand patches to the upstream Linux kernel over the years. At Intel, Colin continued his kernel contributions with performance optimizations and more.If his name doesn't ring a bell, perhaps you know it from Stress-NG with Colin being the lead developer of those kernel micro-benchmarks. Colin has made incredible contributions to the upstream Linux kernel community over the past many years.Colin announced his departure from Intel today on LinkedIn:\\n\\nIn there he also announced he will now apparently be working for NVIDIA. For the benefit of the upstream Linux kernel community, hopefully he will be continuing to focus on upstream Linux kernel activity at NVIDIA... Especially given their increasing open-source GPU driver activity as well as growing kernel activity elsewhere from their networking products to other data center offerings and also needing to ensure the Linux kernel is performing effectively for showcasing the power of their products for AI and more.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has just started shipping its highly anticipated NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra solutions worldwide, a move that is capturing plenty of investor attention. These new systems represent more than incremental upgrades. They promise to deliver rapid deployment and enhanced performance for some of the most demanding AI data center projects. With pre-validated racks, plug-and-play installation, and cutting-edge cooling innovations, Super Micro is making a bold play to lead the next wave of AI infrastructure.\\n\\nThis launch arrives at a pivotal moment for Super Micro. After a stretch of volatility, the stock jumped 4% on the news of these volume shipments, signaling a renewed sense of optimism in the company’s growth story. Over the past year, SMCI shares have wavered with a small year-over-year dip, but momentum has started building again in 2025, helped along by AI-driven product expansions and major partnerships. While there has been a near 50% year-to-date gain, recent months have seen some pullback, reminding investors that expectations remain high but not assured.\\n\\nAfter a big announcement and a sharp move, the big question remains. Is Super Micro ready for another leg up, or is the market already factoring in all that future growth?\\n\\nMost Popular Narrative: 39.6% Undervalued\\n\\nAccording to the most popular narrative, Super Micro Computer is considered significantly undervalued. The argument hinges on robust projected growth and strong positioning in the AI infrastructure market.\\n\\nPartnerships with NVDA, AMD, xAI and Intel position them as one of the most attractive providers of GPU data center infrastructure. They are also profiting from growth in other related industries such as Cloud, 5G and Storage. Using the SWS Fair Value tool and management guidance of $23bn for 2025 and $40bn for 2026, I decided to use a revenue growth rate of 50% to reach an estimated revenue of $50bn for 2028, which I consider conservative.\\n\\nCurious about what drives this bold undervaluation call? The key lies in aggressive growth assumptions and a premium multiple historically reserved for industry giants. Want to see how these strategic forecasts transform into a game-changing price target and why this narrative is gaining traction? The most intriguing projections are just one click away.\\n\\nResult: Fair Value of $74.53 (UNDERVALUED)\\n\\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\\n\\nHowever, risks remain, including potential regulatory hurdles and execution missteps.

       "  'content': 'Randy Pitchford has responded to complaints about the console version of Borderlands 4 lacking a field of view (FOV) slider, suggesting fairness may have something to do with it.\\n\\nPlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S players of Borderlands 4 were shocked to discover not only a lack of a FOV slider in-game, but no motion blur toggle, either. The PC version of Borderlands 4 has settings for both — in the case of FOV you can increase the value in degrees up to 110 for both first-person play and vehicle use, and for motion blur you can change the amount and the quality.\\n\\nThe lack of a FOV slider is the biggest issue right now with Borderlands 4 on console, if anecdotal evidence across the internet is anything to go by, with some complaining that not being able to tweak the FOV value is causing them motion sickness.\\n\\n“Man, I\\'ve tried to play it twice today,” said redditor xInsaneAbilityx. “Both times I get that ‘car-sick’ feel after about 15 minutes and have to stop.” “Yeah I’m pretty sensitive to motion sickness and a narrow FOV in first-person makes me really dizzy. Combining that with motion blur just churns my stomach,” added Dallywack3r. “This game feels almost zoomed in, it‘s really not pleasant to play,” said christophlieber.\\n\\nThere are also suggestions the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a FOV slider in order to maintain certain performance levels. By increasing the FOV, you’re putting the hardware under more strain and potentially impacting things like framerate.\\n\\nBut social media posts from Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford suggest one of the considerations is fairness.\\n\\nBorderlands 4 Review Screenshots View 159 Images\\n\\n“Quickie for console friends: FOV settings,” Pitchford began. “There\\'s some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can\\'t really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we\\'re looking at it.”\\n\\nPitchford included a vote in his social media post, which, after nearly 25,000 votes, reveals just how important a FOV slider is to his followers. At the time of this article’s publication, the option “FOV slider or GTFO!” had 72% of the vote.\\n\\nThe outspoken Gearbox boss went on to say players “have no idea what the team and I were planning and how FOV slider might affect fairness with such a thing.”\\n\\nHe added: “That said, I\\'ve always want to commit to and prioritize what Borderlands should be versus try to turn it into something it should. My hope is for my/our ambitions to be additive, not subtractive.”\\n\\nQuickie for console friends: FOV settings: There\\'s some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can\\'t really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we\\'re looking at it. Vote here: — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) September 12, 2025\\n\\nSo, what is Pitchford actually saying here? The “fairness” quote has caused some confusion. Could it relate to an upcoming PvP mode? If so, why would the PC version have it? Right now, Borderlands 4 is a PvE co-op game, so the line about “fairness” has raised more than a few eyebrows.\\n\\nSome are wondering if Pitchford is talking about fairness in terms of the performance of the game giving some players an advantage. The higher the FOV, the more the player can see, versus the lower the FOV the more stable the frames are. Perhaps both give some level of advantage?\\n\\n“What does ‘fairness’ even mean?’ asked redditor buddachickentml. “Basically being impartial to all players without favoritism. Fairness to all,” suggested Wolf-O7. “Funny enough it\\'s completely backwards though. Because console players aren\\'t being treated fairly compared to their counterpart on PC. (Especially since this sort of sounds like a PVP mode the way he makes it seem).” Then, from Airaen: “Yeah, how is it fair that PC players can change the FoV and console players can\\'t?” “Fairness in a PvE game? Will you ban ultrawide monitors?” said on social media user.\\n\\nBorderlands 4 supports crossplay between all platforms at launch, so Pitchford’s comments are doubly confusing.\\n\\nAs for motion blur, in another social media post Pitchford told console players \"we aren\\'t down with motion blur and do not support it.\" He continued: “If you\\'re seeing what seems to be motion blur, maybe check your television settings for whatever automatic BS it might be doing to your image? It\\'s not us.”\\n\\nBut again, that comment is confusing given there are motion blur settings in Borderlands 4 on PC.\\n\\nRandy Pitchford has addressed Borderlands 4 console complaints. Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Lionsgate.\\n\\nWhatever Pitchford means here, Borderlands 4 has got off to a big start on Steam. It’s approaching a peak concurrent player count of 300,000 on Valve’s platform, where it is one of the most-played games. No other Borderlands game has come close to that in terms of concurrent player numbers on Steam.\\n\\nPitchford declared it impossible to break the Borderlands 4 servers this weekend through sheer weight of player numbers alone — and he’s so confident he’s publicly promised that Borderlands 4 won’t join the long list of big AAA games whose online systems fail at launch.\\n\\nWhile Borderlands 4 is off to a big start in terms of player numbers, it’s not entirely plain sailing for Gearbox. The release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.\\n\\nIn response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on Steam , advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.\\n\\nGearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game\\'s performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings : “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC\\'s performance has changed.”\\n\\nIf you are delving into Borderlands 4 don\\'t go without updated hourly SHiFT codes list .

       " {'headline': \"AMD's RDNA4 GPU Architecture at Hot Chips 2025\",\n",
       "  'content': \"RDNA4 is AMD’s latest graphics-focused architecture, and fills out their RX 9000 line of discrete GPUs. AMD noted that creating a good gaming GPU requires understanding both current workloads, as well as taking into account what workloads might look like five years in the future. Thus AMD has been trying to improve efficiency across rasterization, compute, and raytracing. Machine learning has gained importance including in games, so AMD’s new GPU architecture caters to ML workloads as well.\\n\\nFrom AMD’s perspective, RDNA4 represents a large efficiency leap in raytracing and machine learning, while also improving on the rasterization front. Improved compression helps keep the graphics architecture fed. Outside of the GPU’s core graphics acceleration responsibility, RDNA4 brings improved media and display capabilities to round out the package.\\n\\nMedia Engine\\n\\nThe Media Engine provides hardware accelerated video encode and decode for a wide range of codecs. High end RDNA4 parts like the RX 9070XT have two media engines. RDNA4’s media engines feature faster decoding speed, helping save power during video playback by racing to idle. For video encoding, AMD targeted better quality in H.264, H.265, and AV1, especially in low latency encoding.\\n\\nLow latency encoder modes are mostly beneficial for streaming, where delays caused by the media engine ultimately translate to a delayed stream. Reducing latency can make quality optimizations more challenging. Video codecs strive to encode differences between frames to economize storage. Buffering up more frames gives the encoder more opportunities to look for similar content across frames, and lets it allocate more bitrate budget for difficult sequences. But buffering up frames introduces latency. Another challenge is some popular streaming platforms mainly use H.264, an older codec that’s less efficient than AV1. Newer codecs are being tested, so the situation may start to change as the next few decades fly by. But for now, H.264 remains important due to its wide support.\\n\\nTesting with an old gameplay clip from Elder Scrolls Online shows a clear advantage for RDNA4’s media engine when testing with the latency-constrained VBR mode and encoder tuned for low latency encoding (-usage lowlatency -rc vbr_latency). Netflix’s VMAF video quality metric gives higher scores for RDNA4 throughout the bitrate range. Closer inspection generally agrees with the VMAF metric.\\n\\nRDNA4 does a better job preserving high contrast outlines. Differences are especially visible around text, which RDNA4 handles better than its predecessor while using a lower bitrate. Neither result looks great with such a close look, with blurred text on both examples and fine detail crushed in video encoding artifacts. But it’s worth remembering that the latency-constrained VBR mode uses a VBV buffer of up to three frames, while higher latency modes can use VBV buffer sizes covering multiple seconds of video. Encoding speed has improved slightly as well, jumping from ~190 to ~200 FPS from RDNA3.5 to RDNA4.\\n\\nDisplay Engine\\n\\nThe display engine fetches on-screen frame data from memory, composites it into a final image, and drives it to the display outputs. It’s a basic task that most people take for granted, but the display engine is also a good place to perform various image enhancements. A traditional example is using a lookup table to apply color correction. Enhancements at the display engine are invisible to user software, and are typically carried out in hardware with minimal power cost. On RDNA4, AMD added a “Radeon Image Sharpening” filter, letting the display engine sharpen the final image. Using dedicated hardware at the display engine instead of the GPU’s programmable shaders means that the sharpening filter won’t impact performance and can be carried out with better power efficiency. And, AMD doesn’t need to rely on game developers to implement the effect. Sharpening can even apply to the desktop, though I’m not sure why anyone would want that.\\n\\nPower consumption is another important optimization area for display engines. Traditionally that’s been more of a concern for mobile products, where maximizing battery life under low load is a top priority. But RDNA4 has taken aim at multi-monitor idle power with its newer display engine. AMD’s presentation stated that they took advantage of variable refresh rates on FreeSync displays. They didn’t go into more detail, but it’s easy to imagine what AMD might be doing. High resolution and high refresh rate displays translate to high pixel rates. That in turn drives higher memory bandwidth demands. Dynamically lowering refresh rates could let RDNA4’s memory subsystem enter a low power state while still meeting refresh deadlines.\\n\\nPower and GDDR6 data rates for various refresh rate combinations. AMD’s monitoring software (and others) read out extremely low memory clocks when the memory bus is able to idle, so those readings aren’t listed.\\n\\nI have a RX 9070 hooked up to a Viotek GN24CW 1080P display via HDMI, and a MSI MAG271QX 1440P capable of refresh rates up to 360 Hz. The latter is connected via DisplayPort. The RX 9070 manages to keep memory at idle clocks even at high refresh rate settings. Moving the mouse causes the card to ramp up memory clocks and consume more power, hinting that RDNA4 is lowering refresh rates when screen contents don’t change. Additionally, RDNA4 gets an intermediate GDDR6 power state that lets it handle the 1080P 60 Hz + 1440P 240 Hz combination without going to maximum memory clocks. On RDNA2, it’s more of an all or nothing situation. The older card is more prone to ramping up memory clocks to handle high pixel rates, and power consumption remains high even when screen contents don’t change.\\n\\nCompute Changes\\n\\nRDNA4’s Workgroup Processor retains the same high level layout as prior RDNA generations. However, it gets major improvements targeted towards raytracing, like improved raytracing units and wider BVH nodes, a dynamic register allocation mode, and a scheduler that no longer suffers false memory dependencies between waves. I covered those in previous articles. Besides those improvements, AMD’s presentation went over a couple other details worth discussing.\\n\\nScalar Floating Point Instructions\\n\\nAMD has a long history of using a scalar unit to offload operations that are constant across a wave. Scalar offload saves power by avoiding redundant computation, and frees up the vector unit to increase performance in compute-bound sequences. RDNA4’s scalar unit gains a few floating point instructions, expanding scalar offload opportunities. This capability debuted on RDNA3.5, but RDNA4 brings it to discrete GPUs.\\n\\nWhile not discussed in AMD’s presentation, scalar offload can bring additional performance benefits because scalar instructions sometimes have lower latency than their vector counterparts. Most basic vector instructions on RDNA4 have 5 cycle latency. FP32 adds and multiples on the scalar unit have 4 cycle latency. The biggest latency benefits still come from offloading integer operations though.\\n\\nSplit Barriers\\n\\nGPUs use barriers to synchronize threads and enforce memory ordering. For example, a s_barrier instruction on older AMD GPUs would cause a thread to wait until all of its peers in the workgroup also reached the s_barrier instruction. Barriers degrade performance because any thread that happened to reach the barrier faster would have to stall until its peers catch up.\\n\\nRDNA4 splits the barrier into separate “signal” and “wait” actions. Instead of s_barrier, RDNA4 has s_barrier_signal and s_barrier_wait. A thread can “signal” the barrier once it produces data that other threads might need. It can then do independent work, and only wait on the barrier once it needs to use data produced by other threads. The s_barrier_wait will then stall the thread until all other threads in the workgroup have signalled the barrier.\\n\\nMemory Subsystem\\n\\nThe largest RDNA4 variants have a 8 MB L2 cache, representing a substantial L2 capacity increase compared to prior RDNA generations. RDNA3 and RDNA2 maxed out at 6 MB and 4 MB L2 capacities, respectively. AMD found that difficult workloads like raytracing benefit from the larger L2. Raytracing involves pointer chasing during BVH traversal, and it’s not surprising that it’s more sensitive to accesses getting serviced from the slower Infinity Cache as opposed to L2. In the initial scene in 3DMark’s DXR feature test, run in Explorer Mode, RDNA4 dramatically cuts down the amount of data that has to be fetched from beyond L2.\\n\\nRDNA2 still does a good job of keeping data in L2 in absolute terms. But it’s worth noting that hitting Infinity Cache on both platforms adds more than 50 ns of extra latency over a L2 hit. That’s well north of 100 cycles because both RDNA2 and RDNA4 run above 2 GHz. While AMD’s graphics strategy has shifted towards making the faster caches bigger, it still contrasts with Nvidia’s strategy of putting way more eggs in the L2 basket. Blackwell’s L2 cache serves the functions of both AMD’s L2 and Infinity Cache, and has latency between those two cache levels. Nvidia also has a flexible L1/shared memory allocation scheme that can give them more low latency caching capacity in front of L2, depending on a workload’s requested local storage (shared memory) capacity.\\n\\nA mid-level L1 cache was a familiar fixture on prior RDNA generations. It’s conspicuously missing from RDNA4, as well as AMD’s presentation. One possibility is that L1 cache hitrate wasn’t high enough to justify the complexity of an extra cache level. Perhaps AMD felt its area and transistor budget was better allocated towards increasing L2 capacity. To support this theory, L1 hitrate on RDNA1 was often below 50%. At the same time, the RDNA series always enjoyed a high bandwidth and low latency L2. Putting more pressure on L2 in exchange for reducing L2 misses may have been an enticing tradeoff. Another possibility is that AMD ran into validation issues with the L1 cache and decided to skip it for this generation. There’s no way to verify either possibility of course, but I think the former reasons make more sense.\\n\\nBeyond tweaking the cache hierarchy, RDNA4 brings improvements to transparent compression. AMD emphasized that they’re using compression throughout the SoC, including at points like the display engine and media engine. Compressed data can be stored in caches, and decompressed before being written back to memory. Compression cuts down on data transfer, which reduces bandwidth requirements and improves power efficiency.\\n\\nTransparent compression is not a new feature. It has a long history of being one tool in the GPU toolbox for reducing memory bandwidth usage, and it would be difficult to find any modern GPU without compression features of some sort. Even compression in other blocks like the display engine have precedent. Intel’s display engines for example use Framebuffer Compression (FBC), which can write a compressed copy of frame data and keep fetching the compressed copy to reduce data transfer power usage as long as the data doesn’t change. Prior RDNA generations had compression features too, and AMD’sdocumentation summarizes some compression targets. While AMD didn’t talk about compression efficiency, I tried to take similar frame captures using RGP on both RDNA1 and RDNA4 to see if there’s a large difference in memory access per frame. It didn’t quite work out the way I expected, but I’ll put them here anyway and discuss why evaluating compression efficacy is challenging.\\n\\nThe first challenge is that both architectures satisfy most memory requests from L0 or L1. AMD slides on RDNA1 suggest the L0 and L1 only hold decompressed data, at least for delta color compression. Compression does apply to L2. For RDNA4, AMD’s slides indicate it applies to the Infinity Cache too. However, focusing on data transfer to and from the L2 wouldn’t work due the large cache hierarchy differences between those RDNA generations.\\n\\nDCC, or delta color compression, is not the only form of compression. But this slide shows one example of compression/decompression happening in front of L2\\n\\nAnother issue is, it’s easy to imagine a compression scheme that doesn’t change the number of cache requests involved. For example, data might be compressed to only take up part of a cacheline. A request only causes a subset of the cacheline to be read out, which a decompressor module expands to the full 128B. Older RDNA1 slides are ambiguous about this, indicating that DCC operates on 256B granularity (two cachelines) without providing further details.\\n\\nIn any case, compression may be a contributing factor in RDNA4 being able to achieve better performance while using a smaller Infinity Cache than prior generations, despite only having a 256-bit GDDR6 DRAM setup.\\n\\nSoC Features\\n\\nAMD went over RAS, or reliability, availability, and serviceability features in RDNA4. Modern chips use parity and ECC to detect errors and correct them, and evidently RDNA4 does the same. Unrecoverable errors are handled with driver intervention, by “re-initializing the relevant portion of the SoC, thus preventing the platform from shutting down”. There’s two ways to interpret that statement. One is that the GPU can be re-initialized to recover from hardware errors, obviously affecting any software relying on GPU acceleration. Another is that some parts of the GPU can be re-initialized while the GPU continues handling work. I think the former is more likely, though I can imagine the latter being possible in limited forms too. For example, an unrecoverable error reading from GDDR6 can hypothetically be fixed if that data is backed by a duplicate in system memory. The driver could transfer known-good data from the host to replace the corrupted copy. But errors with modified data would be difficult to recover from, because there might not be an up-to-date copy elsewhere in the system.\\n\\nOn the security front, microprocessors get private buses to “critical blocks” and protected register access mechanisms. Security here targets HDCP and other DRM features, which I don’t find particularly amusing. But terminology shown on the slide is interesting, because MP0 and MP1 are also covered in AMD’s CPU-side documentation. On the CPU side, MP0 (microprocessor 0) handles some Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) features. It’s sometimes called the Platform Security Processor (PSP) too. MP1 on CPUs is called the System Management Unit (SMU), which covers power control functions. Curiously AMD’s slide labels MP1 and the SMU separately on RDNA4. MP0/MP1 could have completely different functions on GPUs of course. But the common terminology raises the possibility that there’s a lot of shared work between CPU and GPU SoC design. RAS is also a very traditional CPU feature, though GPUs have picked up RAS features over time as GPU compute picked up steam.\\n\\nInfinity Fabric\\n\\nOne of the most obvious examples of shared effort between the CPU and GPU sides is Infinity Fabric making its way to graphics designs. This started years ago with Vega, though back then using Infinity Fabric was more of an implementation detail. But years later, Infinity Fabric components provided an elegant way to implement a large last level cache, or multi-socket coherent systems with gigantic iGPUs (like MI300A).\\n\\nSlide from Hot Chips 29, covering Infinity Fabric used in AMD’s older Vega GPU\\n\\nThe Infinity Fabric memory-side subsystem on RDNA4 consists of 16 CS (Coherent Station) blocks, each paired with a Unified Memory Controller (UMC). Coherent Stations receive requests coming off the graphics L2 and other clients. They ensure coherent memory access by either getting data from a UMC, or by sending a probe if another block has a more up-to-date copy of the requested cacheline. The CS is a logical place to implement a memory side cache, and each CS instance has 4 MB of cache in RDNA4.\\n\\nTo save power, Infinity Fabric supports DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) to save power, and clocks between 1.5 and 2.5 GHz. Infinity Fabric bandwidth is 1024 bytes per clock, which suggests the Infinity Cache can provide 2.5 TB/s of theoretical bandwidth. That roughly lines up with results from Nemes’s Vulkan-based GPU cache and memory bandwidth microbenchmark.\\n\\nAMD also went over their ability to disable various SoC components to harvest dies and create different SKUs. Shader Engines, WGPs, and memory controller channels can be disabled. AMD and other manufacturers have used similar harvesting capabilities in the past. I’m not sure what’s new here. Likely, AMD wants to re-emphasize their harvesting options.\\n\\nFinally, AMD mentioned that they chose a monolithic design for RDNA4 because it made sense for a graphics engine of its size. They looked at performance goals, package assembly and turnaround time, and cost. After evaluating those factors, they decided a monolithic design was the right option. It’s not a surprise. After all, AMD used monolithic designs for lower end RDNA3 products with smaller graphics engines, and only used chiplets for the largest SKUs. Rather, it’s a reminder that there’s no one size fits all solution. Whether a monolithic or chiplet-based design makes more sense depends heavily on design goals.\\n\\nFinal Words\\n\\nRDNA4 brings a lot of exciting improvements to the table, while breaking away from any attempt to tackle the top end performance segment. Rather than going for maximum performance, RDNA4 looks optimized to improve efficiency over prior generations. The RX 9070 offers similar performance to the RX 7900XT in rasterization workloads despite having a lower power budget, less memory bandwidth, and a smaller last level cache. Techspot also shows the RX 9070 leading with raytracing workloads, which aligns with AMD's goal of enhancing raytracing performance.\\n\\nSlide from RDNA4’s Launch Presentation not Hot Chips 2025\\n\\nAMD achieves this efficiency using compression, better raytracing structures, and a larger L2 cache. As a result, RDNA4 can pack its performance into a relatively small 356.5 mm² die and use a modest 256-bit GDDR6 memory setup. Display and media engine improvements are welcome too. Multi-monitor idle power feels like a neglected area for discrete GPUs, even though I know many people use multiple monitors for productivity. Lowering idle power in those setups is much appreciated. On the media engine side, AMD’s video encoding capabilities have often lagged behind the competition. RDNA4’s progress at least prevents AMD from falling as far behind as they have before.\\n\\nIf you like the content then consider heading over to the Patreon or PayPal if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

       "  'content': 'Any day now, a new version of Apple\\'s macOS is due to launch, and it will exclude the bulk of the Intel-powered models the company has ever sold. However, there are multiple ways to breathe new life into Macs that go back as far as 10 or even 15 years.\\n\\nThe Reg FOSS desk has two older Intel Macs in daily use that can\\'t run any currently-supported version of macOS, though. Recently, we\\'ve been exploring our available options, and we\\'ve found that there are multiple potential routes to keep an old-time Mac productive.\\n\\nmacOS 26 \"Tahoe\" is due in a few days, and there are a whole four Intel Macs that will be able to run it: the 2019 MacBook Pro and Mac Pro, and the 2020 MacBook Pro and iMac. Those are the official models, anyway. As we covered back in 2023, the OpenCore Legacy Patcher project offers a free tool that lets you create a custom-modified macOS installer that will let you install newer versions of macOS onto Macs too old to officially support them. We reckon there\\'s a good chance that a future update to OCLP will make more older models able to run macOS 26.\\n\\n\"Tahoe\" is officially the last-ever macOS for Intel hardware, though. The switch to Arm-based Apple Silicon processors is permanently closing the door on the \"Hackintosh\" world, and the world of Arm devices is so wildly heterogeneous that there\\'s basically zero prospect of running Arm macOS on anything else. That\\'s why there\\'s the special Armbian distro just to make the current Linux available on Arm kit.\\n\\nBefore we tried to upgrade one of our daily drivers with OCLP, though, we wanted to test drive upgrading to an unsupported macOS. To this end, we recently pulled a retired MacBook out of storage. It\\'s a 2010 13-inch MacBook Pro. The last supported macOS for this model is 10.13 \"High Sierra\", and the newest mainstream web browser for this is Firefox 115, which is the ESR release from 2023. When its successor Firefox 128 appeared, Mozilla said it would keep updating version 115 for as long as possible. As The Register reported last week, that currently means March 2026. To get to the subsequent Firefox ESR, we needed at least macOS 10.15 \"Catalina\".\\n\\nThis shouldn\\'t work, but it does: macOS 10.15 running happily on a MacBook Pro from two years before Apple\\'s cut-off - Click to enlarge\\n\\nThat poses a slight snag. The 2010 MBP is the only Core 2 Duo machine we\\'ve encountered that refuses memory that\\'s faster than the 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM for which it\\'s specified. It wants at least one PC3-8500 SO-DIMM, and it won\\'t start with PC3-10600, let alone even faster. (We blame the Nvidia GeForce 320M GPU for this fussiness.) As a result, our MBP only has 6 GB of RAM. That\\'s a snag.\\n\\nThe current release of OCLP is version 2.4.1 and the oldest macOS it supports is macOS 11 \"Big Sur\". Officially, this will run in 4 GB, but we suspect it might be rather sluggish. However, OCLP doesn\\'t support Catalina.\\n\\nEnter the DOS dude\\n\\nHelp is at hand from Collin Mistr, AKA dosdude1. Among other apps, he offers a tool called macOS Catalina Patcher. It\\'s a just-over-200-MB download, although obviously you will need a copy of macOS Catalina as well. Apple has a helpful downloads page for every version from 10.7 to 15 (oddly, except 10.9 Mavericks, which was the first release the company distributed for free).\\n\\nCatalina Patcher offers three different ways to install, including an in-place upgrade. - Click to enlarge\\n\\nThe \"Install macOS Catalina.app\" file is an 8.26 GB download, so we didn\\'t download a fresh copy: we copied it from our iMac onto a Mac-formatted USB key, and then onto the MBP. Then we downloaded Mistr\\'s patcher and ran it. (Unsurprisingly, this is not an authorized app, as it does something Apple doesn\\'t want to support, so don\\'t double-click it; right-click it and pick Open.) It offers the choice of creating an installer USB, installing onto the machine it\\'s running on, or creating an ISO file.\\n\\nSince this is a sacrificial testbed machine – it was replaced by a Core i7 Dell Latitude running ChromeOS Flex a couple of years ago – we just told it to install in place. It creates a modified installer in the /tmp folder, then launches that. First this converted our HFS+ SSD into the newer APFS format, then started the upgrade. Apple\\'s time estimate was just under half an hour, but it took longer. Once the process finished, our 2010 MacBook Pro was running the 2020 version of macOS, even though it officially only supports models from 2012 onwards. On its own, macOS found an update for Safari, downloaded and installed it, and we were done.\\n\\nThere are no giveaways that this is an unofficial OS. The About this Mac dialog box still identifies the correct model, its GPU, its RAM slots, everything. On first launch, Firefox 115 automatically updated itself to version 128, and we then manually upgraded that to the latest 142. It runs fine – not blazingly fast, but pretty well for a 15-year-old computer based on a CPU launched in 2007.\\n\\nOur primary objective was successfully accomplished: to get a current, supported web browser. A few applets automatically updated themselves, such as the Rectangle window-tiling tool. We had to manually download Chrome from Google\\'s Other Platforms page, and version 128 is the latest for this old OS, but it works.\\n\\nEvery silver lining has a cloud\\n\\nThere are some drawbacks to the upgrade, though. The machine is a little more sluggish than before. Although 10.15 was the first all-64-bit version of macOS, it has multiple new features to offset the removal of the 32-bit subsystems: the APFS filesystem, built-in Siri, several separate apps in place of iTunes, and so on. Our ancient but perfectly serviceable copy of Microsoft Office 2011 was 32-bit only so it no longer works. We grabbed the latest LibreOffice 25.8, which does work, but it\\'s not exactly snappy. Now we have dark mode. Woohoo.\\n\\nTo be honest, just as Office 2011 did everything we wanted and a very great deal more besides, so did High Sierra. As The Register said in 2017:\\n\\nAll High Sierra\\'s most interesting features are at the deep system level. 10.13 has no new apps and (almost) no new user-facing features at all. Apple has even resisted to give a cosmetic makeover to what\\'s already there.\\n\\nIn this, it reminds us of the classic Mac OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\", of which the same writer said:\\n\\nWhat greeted me was familiar: Snow Leopard starts like Leopard, down to the pixel. Apple promises that Snow Leopard frees about 7 GB from a comparable Leopard installation… there\\'s some serious shrinkage going on. Safari\\'s public beta on Leopard weighs in at 45 MB, but the Snow Leopard Safari at just 14 MB. The Address Book shrinks from 58 MB to 15 MB. Mail is now 77.5 MB.\\n\\nThat\\'s the kind of upgrade we like. These days, 10.6 is hailed as one of the best-ever releases. Perhaps we should say liked, because High Sierra was the last time Apple managed a new version that looked and worked the same, but tightened everything up under the hood.\\n\\nNostalgia for old OS releases‽\\n\\nPart of the reason for this dramatic shrinkage was that Mac OS X 10.5 \"Leopard\" was the last ever PowerPC version. 10.6 removed all the PowerPC code, leaving only Rosetta, licensed from Transitive – which also sold it as QuickTransit to HP and Novell before IBM acquired it in 2008.\\n\\nOfficially, Snow Leopard is Intel only. That hasn\\'t stopped the hardcore PowerMac enthusiasts, though, who have managed to custom-compile and put out a pre-release version.\\n\\nSome Mac fans miss old versions, just as some Windows fans do. We\\'ve written about running the translucent glories of Windows 7 in 2025, as we did about running Windows XP in 2023.\\n\\nAlthough it still looks sleek, Snow Leopard is so long in the tooth now that it\\'s more of a Smilodon. This vulture ran it for years on a homemade Hackintosh, but we don\\'t want to go back that far.\\n\\nWe recently discovered the website of Jonathan \"Wowfunhappy\" Alland, a discerning vintage-macOS aficionado who runs Mavericks Forever, and on it, he explains in detail why he chose this particular version; for instance, it was the first OS X to support memory compression, so it runs well on low-memory machines, and it was one of the last versions to retain the Aqua appearance. He also has a meticulously curated Mavericks App Library.\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve upgraded our elderly MacBook Pro, we\\'re considering maxing out its memory and seeing how far we can upgrade it, but we might end up going backwards instead. However, on the same trip when we retrieved the MBP, we also collected an even older MacBook: a 2008 white MacBook. Sadly, this machine really is maxed out. As far as we can find out, OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" really is the last version of OS X it can run.\\n\\nLeopards and Lions … why not revenant Foxes, and shiny shiny Chromium?\\n\\nBut some of the hints on Mavericks Forever made us wonder if we could make Lion a little more useful. Before COVID-19, we had installed Firefox Legacy on the machine. It\\'s based on Firefox 68, but although it\\'s not maintained anymore, it still works and can open most contemporary websites. The Mavericks page told us about Firefox Dynasty. This is a port of the current Firefox for older versions of Mac OS X, back to version 10.8 \"Mountain Lion\".\\n\\nUnfortunately, it\\'s on GitHub, and Firefox Legacy can\\'t open GitHub\\'s JavaScript-riddled Releases page. But we did recently discover another browser that can: Chromium Legacy. The latest version is from May 2024, based on Chromium 127, but it unzips and runs fine on \"Lion\", and in turn, it enabled us to download Firefox Dynasty.\\n\\nAnd this definitely shouldn\\'t work, but here\\'s the current Firefox (and Chromium 124) on OS X 10.7. - Click to enlarge\\n\\nResult: the latest Firefox 142, complete with vertical tab bar, running happily on the version of OS X El Reg reviewed in 2011. And, for any websites that won\\'t work right in Firefox, we have a fairly recent version of Chromium as well. Suddenly, that makes this ancient OS a much more viable proposition.\\n\\nOne limitation of Chromium Legacy is that it can\\'t check for updates – if there ever will be any more – and you may have difficulties fetching it from GitHub using a very old Firefox. Never fear: Wowfunhappy\\'s Chromium Legacy Downloader is here, and he also offers the corresponding Firefox Dynasty Downloader PrefPane.\\n\\nSomewhere, we think we have a spare 4 GB DDR2 SO-DIMM lying around. We will try to max out the MacBook\\'s RAM at a massive 6 GB, give the creaky old thing a small SSD, and take it out on the road for a run. With two modern browsers, we should be able to handle most things, and fifteen or twenty-year-old writing tools are still absolutely perfect. Maybe we can dig out a copy of Word from before the \"fluent interface\" and its wretched Ribbon were dreamed up.\\n\\nBootnote\\n\\nAs we\\'ve seen, a community of dedicated and determined enthusiasts is getting more recent OSes and modern browsers working on ancient Intel Macs and PowerMacs.\\n\\nBut it\\'s not limited to getting newer OSes running on older kit. The counterpart is Mac OS 9 Lives, which has versions of the real original macOS that have been tweaked to run on some later PowerPC G4 hardware, released after Apple started amending the machines\\' firmware to compel users to switch to the fancy new Mac OS X.\\n\\nFor instance, there\\'s a build of Mac OS 9.2.2 for iBook G4, and another one for the Mac mini G4. Somewhere, we have both of those machines, and once we can find them, we plan to try this out. They are both rather underpowered for Mac OS X, but they represent the fastest hardware ever made for Mac OS 9.\\n\\nOur G4 mini was a gift from the late DJ Walker Morgan, who some Register readers may remember for his Unix column in Personal Computer World under the pseudonym of David Evnull.

However, with the popularization of generative AI tools like DALL-E and Chat-GPT by OpenAI in 2021 which sparked a race among the top tech companies to invest in and create the best generative models as a result we saw a more than 3x surge in AI investment market-wide between 2019 and 2021 which has since come to a plateau following a huge spike in 2021, after many of these companies including Microsoft and Google announced that they would be slowing down on their AI related spending and/or exploring in-house solutions to save on CapEx.\\n\\nBut today, It's all about AI and enterprise contracts.

Thinking back to this timeline it almost seemed as if every headline, every social media post, and the majority of online commentary surrounding Nvidia's CES press conference focused on Nvidia forwarding their growth in AI markets ranging from: AI PCs built for developers to more efficiently run LLMs, AI powered Robotics platforms, and their partnerships with various players within the Autonomous Automobile industry such as Toyota and Tesla.\\n\\nStory Continues\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: Quid & Stanford University: 2025 AI Index\\n\\nThis AI investment surge has been congruent with the recent trend in NVDA's datacenter segment overtaking their gaming segment by an exponentially wide margin as seen a more recent 10k filing:\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nIt is worth noting however that the corporate investments into AI only began to plateau in 2021-present, during this time we saw the top companies in the industry collectively aim to reduce their AI CapEx spend was also in alignment with the start of a sharp continuous decline in US Consumer Sentiment as released by the University of Michigan:\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nFurthermore, this decline in consumer sentiment has not only been observed in the US but China as well as China Consumer Sentiment has nose-dived to and even further extent during the same period;\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development via FRED\\n\\nThis sudden decline in the consumer sentiment has led to the pulling of investment capital not just in AI as detailed earlier, but also in adjacent industries like EVs;\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: IEA\\n\\nI have referenced the chart above in a previous article, which delves into my concerns revolving around a recent slowdown in TSLA Cash Flows. If TSLA keeps going on the path that it currently is, their Non-adjusted Free Cash Flows will once again turn negative. Given that TSLA is one of NVDA's top B2B customers, I see this as a worrying trend as this has all aligned with the drop in consumer sentiment starting in 2021.\\n\\nEven as big tech investment into AI pulls back and the consumer sentiment declines, we can still see an exponential growth in the amount of newly funded Generative AI companies popping up on the frontend.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: Quid & Stanford University: 2025 AI Index\\n\\nThese newfound startups could find themselves entering into what was a booming industry, now entering a cooldown period, if that's the case these companies will be unlikely to find success in chasing the Gen-AI trend now as the CapEx liquidity once provided to this industry by big tech players dries up.\\n\\nConcerningly, when evaluating NVDA's 2025 annual 10k filing it can be seen that 34% of this newfound revenue came from only three of their direct enterprise customers;\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nThough Nvidia did not name their customers directly, it can be inferred through Omida Research's Q32023 report of H100 Shipments that NVDA's top customers were Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon with notable business from TSLA, Oracle, Tiktok, and CoreWeave.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nGiven that many of these customers are the same companies that have begun to cut back on external AI CapEx spending, likely in alignment with the fall of the consumer, it is very likely that NVDA sees an exceptionally greater direct hit in not only their profit margins but also their total revenue as these companies seek internal solutions and competition from potentially more balanced companies such as Intel enters the fray.\\n\\nThe goal of many of these companies are to balance capex spend with their revenues and right now they are focusing on creating the best product for their core consumer base to fall back on, as these companies reduce spending, develop in-house solutions, or find better and most likely cheaper competitors to NVDA, we will see more and more of NVDA's overly focused B2B model dwindle. In times like these it would be great for NVDA to not only have a functioning B2B base but to also maintain its base consumer as a foundation to fall back on in hard times just some of NVDA's most successful corporate customers do, but in the effort to chase a growing AI trend NVDA has lost sight of that foundation and is leaving itself open to a massive pull of liquidity. The time may soon be coming when a company such as NVDA would want to have a strong consumer base to fall back on because as of now when reading into NVDA's QoQ Net Margins, a peak can already be observed, rounding down since the start of 2024 with a declines being experienced the in Q2, 2025.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: MicroTrends.net\\n\\nThe last time we experienced any such decline in margins like this was at the start of 2022 which proceeded a 62% drop from $28.95 a share to $10.81 near the 89-month EMA all within the same year. If things were to go similarly this time around we could experience a similar 60-70% decline to around $50 per share aligning with the 89-month EMA in white.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: TradingView\\n\\nNVDA currently trades at a 57x multiple with a $3.15 EPS, I'd suspect that NVDA has the capacity to correct down to around a 15-20x multiple If it experienced a severe repricing due to its AI endeavors being priced out by the market and there's even the risk of EPS going down due to falling margins. If EPS drops significantly to $1.15, setting it back a year a 20x multiple of that would align with NVDA trading down to $23 a share in the coming months.\\n\\nIntel: Back to the consumer\\n\\nIntel, is taking the opposite approach of Nvidia.\\n\\nAt CES 2025, Intel rolled out its Core Ultra 200 series processors. These cover everything from thin-and-light laptops to high-performance desktops. Unlike Nvidia's corporate-heavy pitch, Intel's message was simple: more power, less energy, and prices that make sense for consumers.\\n\\nThe Core Ultra 200HX and H series aims to bring serious improvements to creators and gamers, better multi-thread performance, integrated Arc graphics, and even built-in NPUs for AI acceleration. The 200U series targets mainstream laptops, while the 200S series brings efficient yet power a high 16-20+ core count 125-watt chips to desktops.\\n\\nIntel is also targeting the mobile and notebook space directly, going up against Qualcomm and ARM and unlike Nvidia, Intel manufacture the majority of its chips in the United States. This puts them ad a great advantage when it comes to managing the ongoing tariffs and is likely to Nvidia heavy reliance on TSMC for production and Samsung for memory chips, which puts Nvidia in the crosshairs of these tariffs in which U.S based and sourced companies such as Intel and Micron could greatly benefit.\\n\\nAs NVDA has shifted its focus away from the consumer INTC has been aggressive in building its product lineup in the favor of the consumer and it really shows when looking at the chart of the historic video card market share:\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: PassMark\\n\\nThe data here shows that NVDA's consumer video card market share dropped from 61.8% in 2022, to 54.2% in 2025, AMD remained stagnant, and during the same period, Intel's share rose from 16.1% to 21%.\\n\\nObserving the chart, it would appear that NVDA's market share is on a downwards trajectory with more declines likely as competition, mainly the now pro-consumer focused Intel continues to gain ground within NVDA's lost, yet core industry as Intel's product lineup right now puts the core consumer base first and remains easily accessible. Unlike NVDA, INTC is not talking about abstract AI models with gimmicky names that sound like they were ripped out of some sci-fi film; they're instead talking about battery life, power efficiency, security features, and real improvements that everyday people will notice when they buy their next laptop or desktop.\\n\\nA familiar trap?\\n\\nIn many ways, this is reminiscent to when Microsoft fumbled with the new generations of Xbox with the Kinect. Microsoft had a winning product in the Xbox 360 but got distracted by the gimmicks introduced with the Kinect, focusing on getting rid of the traditional controller in favor of motion controls, becoming an all in one media hub, and enforcing always online requirements for Xbox One with Kinect; a practice none of the consumers ever approved of yet Microsoft pushed it for years. It seems likely that Microsoft's obsession with motion controls came from their desire to chase after the success of the Nintendo Wii, which released in 2006, introduced motion controls to the masses, and ended up being the best-selling seventh generation console of that generation by far.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: VGChartz\\n\\nBut by the time the eighth generation rolled in, the novelty of motion controls had long played it course and that was made very apparent with the fall in the Nintendo Wii's yearly sales as well as to complete failure of the Wii U.\\n\\nDuring the start of the eighth generation in 2013, we would see Sony, with its PS4 release, focus on games and gamer alike, showcasing pro-consumer features such as game sharing along with the ability to play games without the need of an internet connection; all backed by a strong lineup of game releases to boot. Sony did all of this and even took direct jabs at Microsoft, their competition, who was not then concerned with these pro-consumer moves at the time. Despite these open jabs from Sony, Microsoft would carry on with its anti-consumer practices in favor of the Kinect as it continued to push the all-in-one media hub features which was likely an attempt to compete with the then trending streaming markets, as well as pushing the motion controls which was a dying fad. As a result, a new trend would emerge of yearly PS4 sales consistently being double that of Xbox One sales;\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: VGChartz\\n\\nOne year later the CEO of Microsoft would appoint Phil Spencer as the new head of Xbox who then would undo the anti-consumer practices set in motion by the previous head, Don Mattrick, starting with the unbundling of the kinect and a more consumer friendly approach to gamer by offering backwards compatibility, and reverting back to the brand's roots; Unfortunately it was too late as the previous leadership had already sullied the brand's relationship with its core customer base and many of those that might have considered coming back to Xbox were already comfortably on PlayStation and later on, thanks to a much improved marketing campaign, Nintendo Switch; the result of Xbox's previous years of not focusing on the core consumer and even antagonizing the consumer at times made it very tough to take back market share against Nintendo and Sony, which remained, focused on their core gaming audience throughout.\\n\\nEven all these years later in the ninth generation of consoles, as Microsoft has spent the last 13 years reversing course on all of these anti-consumer practices, they remain significantly behind Nintendo and Sony generations later as the consumer base has already settled within their perspective ecosystems and winning them back has proven to be very hard for Microsoft to do with PS5 sales now being triple that of Xbox Series X/S.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: VGChartz\\n\\nNvidia risks falling into the same trap: chasing enterprise AI hype while forgetting about the consumer market that made it a household name in the first place and in time of economic slowdown Nvidia will need to lean back on this core base but by the time they do another competitor would have likely scooped up a significant portion of this core base and just like Microsoft with the Xbox, it could take years before Nvidia can rebuild all of that lost consumer trust.\\n\\nValuation Overview:\\n\\nWhen taking in account NVDA's slowdown in profit margins mainly attributed to the slowdown in enterprise revenue paired with their loss in market share to INTC within the consumer base, it makes sense to consider INTC as the alternative investment to NVDA. Despite INTC's recent shaky history of EPS misses, it is worth considering the fact that the stock price trades at a very low price to sales multiple of 1.98x:\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n\\nThis low price to sales value contrasts with NVDA's which currently trades at a 25.95x multiple to its sales;\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n\\nThis in my opinion is a massive oversight in the market that shows speculative growth being priced into NVDA while ignoring the current actual contraction NVDA is currently facing, as a result, the comparison of these ratios tells us that sales growth is failing to keep up with the high speculative valuations of the current market.\\n\\nMeanwhile the market has severely undervalued INTC, not taking into consideration the fact that it is currently gaining a significant core market share against NVDA and AMD alike in a trend that seems likely to continue.\\n\\nLooking into other valuation data we can also see that INTC trades at a 1.01x book value which ultimately confirms that despite INTC's recent growth, the stock market still hasn't priced in any growth at all within the company which means that the stock is currently at its fairest value right now.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n\\nMeanwhile when looking at NVDA's price to book we can see that in spite of recent contractions, the market is still valuing NVDA's stock at a 42.33x multiple to its book value.\\n\\nHas Nvidia Lost Sight of the Core Consumer?\\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n\\nTaking in the totality of the data it would be in my opinion a valuable opportunity to capitalize on the arbitrage between NVDA and INTC's valuation and performance by investing long term into INTC rather it be shares or Long Call LEAPS (1 year or more of theta), while reducing share allocation or even buying some longer dated 300+ DTE OTM puts in NVDA or at least hedging current long positions in NVDA more aggressively with covered calls. As this arbitrage closes, I would anticipate NVDA's market cap valuation to contract while INTC's expands, narrowing the current spread between NVDA's $4.4T and INTC's $100B market cap valuations.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Thinking about what to do with your NVIDIA shares? You’re not alone. Whether you’ve been riding the wave since the early days or just now looking at that ticker symbol, NVIDIA’s recent moves have certainly put it on everyone’s radar. Just this past week, the stock jumped 6.5%, bouncing back after a minor 1.5% stumble over the past month. For the year-to-date, that’s an impressive climb of 28.6%, while the longer view is almost jaw-dropping: up more than 1,200% over three years and over 1,300% across five years. Those numbers are hard to ignore, especially when the headlines keep NVIDIA front and center in the tech world.\\n\\nRecent news about NVIDIA partnering with global players on massive datacenter investments underscores the company’s persistent growth narrative. At the same time, the company has faced new challenges, like scaling back some cloud services to focus on core strengths and seeing competition rise from major clients developing their own AI chips. The market is taking it all in stride, recalibrating its expectations and risk appetite in real time.\\n\\nIf you’re wondering if all that momentum is baked into today’s price or if there’s more room to grow, here’s a good starting point: by our scorecard, NVIDIA clocks a valuation score of 2 out of 6. That means it’s undervalued in only two key checks, something we’ll break down together, step by step. In the next section, I’ll walk you through these valuation methods to put today’s price in context, and stick around for a smarter way to assess true value at the end.\\n\\nNVIDIA scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\\n\\nApproach 1: NVIDIA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\\n\\nA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model works by forecasting a company’s future free cash flows and then discounting those back to their present value. This gives investors an estimate of what the business is really worth today, based on its expected ability to generate cash in the future.\\n\\nFor NVIDIA, the current Free Cash Flow is $72.28 Billion. Analysts forecast this number to grow rapidly over the upcoming years, reaching a projected $249.21 Billion by 2030. Estimates are solid for the next five years; after that, Simply Wall St algorithmically extends the projections further, reflecting optimism around NVIDIA’s continuing innovation and market expansion.\\n\\nUsing these projections and discounting them to today's dollars, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of $143.89 per share. This valuation suggests NVIDIA shares are around 23.6% overvalued compared to the current stock price.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'NVIDIA has quietly removed its GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 Founders Edition graphics cards from its online marketplace. This removal seems to affect all international online stores, including those in the US, Germany, the UK, and France. In the US, NVIDIA now only offers the Founders Edition version of the GeForce RTX 5070, which includes a Borderlands 4 game as a bonus. The Founders Edition versions of the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 are absent, with AIB-designed versions taking their place. The situation is similar in the UK, while stores in France and Germany only list the RTX 5070 and RTX 5080 Founders Editions, with no RTX 5090 Founders Edition available.One possible reason for this could be that NVIDIA is preparing a mid-cycle refresh with the RTX 50 SUPER series and wants to avoid excess inventory of non-SUPER models. However, this would mainly affect the RTX 5070 and RTX 5080, which are rumored to receive the SUPER upgrade. There is no clear explanation for the absence of the RTX 5090 Founders Edition from all global stores, especially given the high demand and record-breaking gaming revenues . An End-of-Life (EOL) scenario seems unlikely. We can only speculate about NVIDIA\\'s reasons for this removal, but it might be an inventory adjustment, as NVIDIA could have distributed too many of these models to other retailers, leaving none for its own store. We will continue to monitor the marketplace for updates in the coming days.: An NVIDIA spokesperson for Wccftech confirmed that \"GeForce RTX 50 series Founders Editions continue to be in production. They are limited edition products so, from time to time, go out of stock on our website and return when back in stock.\" So there are no long-term reasons for potential buyers to worry about.Below are the screenshots with the available Founders Edition SKUs at the time of writing.

       "  'content': 'On Monday, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, became the fourth company to reach a market value of $3 trillion, and every member of this exclusive club has something in common.\\n\\nAll it took was a rather small 4% rise in shares for the tech giant to hit the coveted stock market benchmark. Rather unsurprisingly, the three previous winners of that title—Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple—are all titans of the tech industry that have been riding the wave of investor interest in AI, as well.\\n\\nAlphabet stock had a great start to September after a federal judge concluded earlier this month that the tech giant could keep Chrome despite its monopoly in internet search. The judge’s reasoning for that was that generative AI would eventually pose “a meaningful challenge to Google’s market dominance.”\\n\\nGoogle is trying to get ahead of that “meaningful challenge” by fusing AI into its search engine and pouring billions into developing its AI offerings, including its own AI chatbot Gemini.\\n\\nIt seems that investment cashed out for the company. As of Monday morning, Google Gemini is now the number one free app on Apple’s App Store, relegating OpenAI’s ChatGPT to number two status and giving the much-needed push to the company’s stock.\\n\\nThe AI hype is inextricably and intricately linked to the significant stock market returns that these tech giants, and many others, have experienced this year. The trillion-dollar question: Is there an AI bubble?\\n\\nAI hype driving major gains\\n\\nThe best example of AI hype delivering trillions of dollars of financial gain is perhaps Nvidia, the ultimate AI darling of the stock market. Due to its immense market share in AI chips and the meteoric rise it experienced thanks to the technology, the company is largely considered the face of the AI hype.\\n\\nEarlier this summer, Nvidia made history as the first company to ever hit $4 trillion market valuation.\\n\\nApple, considered the least AI-savvy of the four companies to breach the $3 trillion benchmark, was the first company to ever be worth $3 trillion but is still yet to hit $4 trillion. Meanwhile, both Nvidia and Microsoft have outperformed Apple and already reached that milestone. Microsoft’s breach of the $4 trillion benchmark was also thanks to AI.\\n\\nLate July, Microsoft posted an earnings report that showed stellar revenue for its cloud computing platform Azure. The stock move following the report pushed Microsoft briefly above $4 trillion market value.\\n\\nFellow cloud infrastructure provider Oracle also benefited greatly from an AI-demand-driven stock move. Chairman Larry Ellison became the richest man on Earth last week after Oracle stock skyrocketed more than 42% on news that the company expects to collect half a trillion dollars (and potentially billions of dollars more) in the coming quarter on AI deals alone.\\n\\nIs there a bubble?\\n\\nAll this is great news for tech companies and their financial metrics, but is it substantiated? That question has been plaguing investors for some time now.\\n\\nAccording to some experts (and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman), there is indeed an AI bubble.\\n\\n“Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said last month in a dinner with journalists, according to The Verge. “My opinion is yes.”\\n\\nAn AI report from MIT fueled those worries further just a few weeks ago. The researchers shared that despite the push to scale AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in ten AI pilot programs have actually generated revenue gains.\\n\\nAI is currently deployed mostly by larger firms in select fields. But even there, AI adoption is now declining, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau findings.\\n\\nIf AI is indeed in a bubble, the burst could be catastrophic. So much is riding on the AI wave right now, including the entire U.S. economy.\\n\\nIn a paper published in July, Fed researchers said that if AI demand does not scale proportionally with investment, it can lead to “disastrous consequences,” and compared it to the railroad over-expansion of the 1800s and the economic depression that followed. Also in July, economist Torsten Slok called the AI bubble of today even worse than the 1999 Dot-com bubble.',\n",

       " {'headline': 'The Borderlands 4 PC Performance Fiasco, Explained',\n",
       "  'content': 'Borderlands 4 launched last week to big numbers and mostly positive reviews on Steam. But there’s been a lot of chatter and debate online about the looter shooter’s performance. Some players aren’t happy that Borderlands 4 seemingly requires DLSS and frame generation to run decently, even on the highest-end hardware. Meanwhile, Gearbox co-founder and CEO Randy Pitchford has defended the game’s performance, calling it “pretty damn optimal,” and suggested people need to use the “tools” provided by the studio and accept some trade-offs.\\n\\nOn PC, many games can utilize real-time upscaling tech, like Nvidia’s DLSS and AMD’s FSR. Nvidia and others have also created tools that allow your GPU to fill in the gaps between real frames rendered by the game with frames generated using deep learning tech. When this kind of tech was first introduced about six years ago or so, players complained that DLSS and other tools made games look blurry, even if it led to some performance boosts. As DLSS and similar tech have improved, the images produced looked have better and better. Today, DLSS 4.0 can produce some truly sharp-looking frames and provide some big performance gains, assuming you have a powerful enough video card.\\n\\nBut some, myself included, have started to grow concerned that studios are building games around DLSS and other similar tech, and aren’t optimizing them in the way devs did in the past. When DLSS was introduced, it felt like a great tool for gamers who had a slightly older card but still wanted to play a newer game. It would let them squeeze out a bit more performance without shelling out for a pricey upgrade. Now it seems like newer games running on more advanced engines require users to turn on DLSS and frame gen to play. And so enters Borderlands 4, a game that has found itself at the center of this heated debate.\\n\\nShortly after Borderlands 4 launched, players on PC began to complain that the game didn’t run very well. Gearbox responded with some updates that, at least in my experience with the game on PC, helped a bit. The company also released a guide from Nvidia for how to optimize the game based on your GPU and settings. And while that helped some reach better performance on PC, many others, myself included, were struggling to get the game to run well on powerful hardware. I’m rocking a 5080, and even playing the game at 1080p on medium settings led to tons of FPS drops, even while trying to play at 60FPS. That all changed when I did as Gearbox and Nvidia suggest and turned on DLSS and frame gen. Now, I can run Borderlands 4 at a mostly locked 120 with most settings set to high and medium. It looks nice and plays fine, but many aren’t okay with a game in 2025 being unable to run on high-end hardware without some upscaling assistance.\\n\\nNot helping matters is the fact that Randy Pitchford posted, as part of a recent and lengthy thread on Twitter, that people should use DLSS because it’s “great” and added: “The game was built to take advantage of it.” That, and a different part of the thread claiming it was acceptable for devs to focus on “default settings” reaching only 30FPS, didn’t go over well with a lot of PC gamers who specifically buy new parts and upgrade their rigs to achieve high framerates at high resolutions. For many, Pitchford’s claim that Borderlands 4 was developed to “take advantage” of DLSS was him confirming that it was built with the assumption that most users would use DLSS. And that, to some, sounds a lot like the game wasn’t properly optimized to run without help from DLSS and frame generation.\\n\\nWhile I do agree that newer DLSS and frame gen tools are powerful and impressive, it feels weird that Borderlands 4, along with other games like Alan Wake 2, demand that even users with the highest-end hardware lean on upscaling tech to play at decent settings and historically popular framerates like 120. In a recent video, the tech experts over at Digital Foundry weren’t impressed with Borderlands 4 on PC, with one even saying: “[Borderlands 4] does seem to be running worse than usual for an Unreal Engine 5 game. It is below where it seems like it should be given how other games using this engine perform.”\\n\\nPitchford has promised on Twitter that more updates are coming, including some more improvements to how the game runs on PC. He’s also been spending a lot of time online helping people improve how Borderlands 4 runs and claiming that performance issues are not as widespread as some might make you believe. Personally, I just miss when games could run on a high-end computer packed with powerful hardware without needing four different upscaling tools. And it seems I’m not alone.',\n",

China, shortly after the announcement, stated it had conditionally approved the deal.\\n\\nHowever, the antitrust investigation was initiated in December 2024 by China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). The investigation remains ongoing, say SAMR officials in the press release.\\n\\n[...] the State Administration for Market Regulation decided to conduct further investigation in accordance with the law.\\n\\nThe SAMR dropped the antitrust news at the same time that Chinese and US officials are attempting to negotiate trade intricacies in Madrid.

(Image credit: Getty Images | Yaorusheng)\\n\\nA lot of recent trade tension between the US and China has NVIDIA sitting in the center. The GPU company's H20 AI chip, created specifically for the Chinese market as a less-powerful alternative to US AI chips, is highly sought after by China's AI firms.\\n\\nHowever, the NVIDIA chip was fully banned from being sold to China in April 2025 by the Trump administration. The cause of the ban centered on concerns that China was using the H20 chips to bolster its military and to develop further domestic AI models that could challenge US firms.\\n\\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\\n\\nThe ban was walked back in July, when NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang reached a deal with President Trump following a White House visit. Huang's argument? It's better to have all AI models running on US technology.\\n\\nIt didn't take long for Huang to announce that NVIDIA was ordering 300,000 more H20 AI chips from TSMC in order to meet Chinese demand. And that was on top of the 600,000 to 700,000 H20 chips already stockpiled and awaiting buyers.\\n\\nAs a final part of the deal with the US government, NVIDIA and AMD agreed to pay a 15% chip tax for the export licenses needed to sell to China. The unprecedented deal remains informally approved. While Chinese AI firms clambered to place orders for the unbanned H20 AI GPUs, state officials began pressuring the firms to avoid the US hardware over fears of tracking devices, spyware, and other hidden back doors.\\n\\nNVIDIA responded by firmly stating that it wasn't placing any sort of trackers or malware in its AI GPUs.\",\n",

Additionally, Wedbush\\'s Daniel Ives reiterated a \"Buy\" rating on September 11. This optimistic analyst sentiment is supported by the company\\'s strong performance, with a recent report noting that SoundHound AI\\'s revenue tripled in the second quarter compared to the previous year. The company\\'s voice AI platform has now surpassed 1 billion queries per month, positioning it to capitalize on the growing use of AI in devices, cars, and homes.\\n\\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $14.37, up 1.8% from previous close.\\n\\nIs now the time to buy SoundHound AI? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\\n\\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\\n\\nSoundHound AI’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 92 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\\n\\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 4.9% on the news that markets pulled back, reversing early gains, as investor sentiment remained cautious despite a softer-than-expected inflation reading.\\n\\nStocks rose in the morning session after an unexpected drop in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for August signaled easing inflation and raised expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the PPI, which measures wholesale prices, edged down 0.1% last month, contrary to analyst expectations for a 0.3% rise. This data gives the Federal Reserve more flexibility to consider lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.\\n\\nSoundHound AI is down 28.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $14.37 per share, it is trading 40.7% below its 52-week high of $24.23 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of SoundHound AI’s shares at the IPO in April 2022 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,915.\\n\\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.
