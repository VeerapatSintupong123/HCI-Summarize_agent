      "headline": "Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI investment raises eyebrows and a key question: How much of the AI boom is just Nvidia’s cash being recycled?",
      "content": "Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently. The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back.\n\nIn addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.\n\nThe extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.\n\nIn past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.\n\nNvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStartups financing data centers have often had to borrow money at rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% that a large, established corporation such as Microsoft might have to pay. With Nvidia’s backing, OpenAI and Coreweave have been able to borrow at rates closer to what Microsoft or Google might pay.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also signed a $6.3 billion deal to purchase any cloud capacity that CoreWeave can’t sell to others. The chipmaker had previously agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years on cloud computing with CoreWeave. Coreweave, meanwhile, has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs so far—the majority of which it says are H100 Hopper models, which cost about $30,000 each—which means Coreweave has spent about $7.5 billion buying these chips from Nvidia. So in essence, all of the money Nvidia has invested in Coreweave has come back to it in the form of revenue.\n\n\n\nNvidia has struck similar cloud computing deals with other so-called “neo-cloud” companies. According to a story in The Information, Nvidia agreed this summer to spend $1.3 billion over four years renting some 10,000 of its own AI chips from Lambda, which like Coreweave runs data centers, as well as a separate $200 million deal to rent some 8,000 more over an unspecified time period.\n\nFor those who believe there’s an AI bubble, the Lambda deal is clear evidence of froth. Those Nvidia chips Lambda is renting time on back to Nvidia? It bought them with borrowed money collateralized by the value of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\n\nBesides its large investments in OpenAI and Coreweave, AI chipmaker also holds multi-million dollar stakes in several other publicly-traded companies that either purchase its GPUs or work on related chip technology. These include chip design firm Arm, high-performance computing company Applied Digital, cloud services company Nebius Group, and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals. (Nvidia also recently purchased a 4% stake in Intel for $5 billion. Like Arm, Intel makes chips that in some cases are alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, but which for the most part are complementary to them.)\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia also pledged to invest £2 billion ($2.7 billion) in U.K. AI startups, including at least £500 million in Nscale, a U.K.-based data center operator that will, presumably, be using some of that money to purchase Nvidia GPUs to provision the data centers it is building. Nvidia also said it would invest in a number of British startups, both directly and through local venture capital firms, and some of that money too, will likely come back to OpenAI in the form of computing purchases, either directly, or through cloud service providers, who in turn will need to buy Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia invested about $1 billion in AI startups globally either directly or through its corporate venture capital arm NVentures, according to data from Dealroom and The Financial Times. This amount was up significantly from what Nvidia invested in 2022, the year the generative AI boom kicked off with OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nHow much of this money winds up coming right back to Nvidia in the form of sales is again, difficult to determine. Wall Street research firm NewStreet Research has estimated that for every $10 billion Nvidia invests in OpenAI, it will see $35 billion worth of GPU purchases or GPU lease payments, an amount equal to about 27% of its annual revenues last fiscal year.\n\nEchoes of the dotcom era\n\nThat kind of return would certainly make this sort of customer financing worthwhile. But it does raise concerns among analysts about a bubble in AI valuations. These kinds of circular deals have been a hallmark of previous technology bubbles and have often come back to haunt investors.\n\nIn this case, the lease arrangements that Nvidia is entering into with OpenAI as part of its latest investment could prove problematic. By leasing GPUs to OpenAI, rather than requiring them to buy the chips outright, Nvidia is sparing OpenAI from having to take an accounting charge for the high depreciation rates on the chips, which will ultimately help OpenAI’s bottom line. But it means that instead Nvidia will have to bear this depreciation costs. What’s more, Nvidia will also take on the risk of being stuck with an inventory of GPUs no one wants if demand for AI workloads don’t match Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rosy predictions.\n\n\n\nTo some market watchers, Nvidia’s latest deals feel all-too-similar to the excesses of past technology booms. During the dot com bubble at the turn of the 21st Century, telecom equipment makers such as Nortel, Lucent, and Cisco lent money to startups and telecom companies to purchase their equipment. Just before the bubble burst in 2001, the amount of financing Cisco and Nortel had extended to their customers exceeded 10% of annual revenues, and the amount of financing the top five telecom equipment makers had provided to customers exceeded 123% of their combined earnings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the amount of fiber-optic cabling and switching equipment installed far exceeded demand, and when the bubble burst and many of those customers went bust, the telecom equipment makers were left holding the bad debt on their balance sheets. This contributed to a greater loss of value when the bubble burst than would have otherwise been the case, with networking equipment businesses losing more than 90% of their value over the ensuing decade.\n\n\n\nWorse yet were companies such as fiber-optic giant Global Crossing that engaged in direct “revenue roundtripping.” These companies cut deals—often at the end of a quarter in order to hit topline forecasts—in which they paid money to another company for services, and then that company agreed to purchase equipment of exactly equal value. When the bubble burst, Global Crossing went bankrupt, and its executives ultimately paid large legal settlements related to revenue roundtripping.\n\n\n\nIt is memories of these kinds of transactions that have caused analysts to at least raise an eyebrow at some of Nvidia’s circular investments. Goldberg, the Seaport Global analyst, said the deals had a whiff of circular financing and were emblematic of “bubble-like behavior.”\n\n“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note following Nvidia’s announcement of its blockbuster investment in OpenAI. It’s a long way from a concern to a crisis, of course, but as AI company valuations get higher, that distance is starting to close.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "headline": "Actual ports and NVIDIA GPUs make this laptop the practical Dell XPS and MacBook Pro alternative",
      "content": "The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i is the premium, feature-packed 16-inch powerhouse for those who need to work, create, and even game on the go. It's an excellent, incredibly practical laptop that feels like the more reasonable alternative to the divisive Dell 16 Premium (previously the Dell XPS 16). I only wish battery life was better, but I can't say I'm shocked it's not.\n\nWhy you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nCreators, engineers, and other professionals the world over rely on powerful 16-inch laptops to keep them working smoothly, even while staying mobile. The Dell XPS 16 (now the Dell 16 Premium), the Apple MacBook Pro 16, the Razer Blade 16 — these are all great choices, but there's another excellent alternative on the block.\n\nThis is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition... which is a ridiculously long name for an incredibly capable laptop with a practical design, potent performance, and an impressive set of features that make it well-suited to almost any task.\n\nIt's also well priced compared to the aforementioned competition, making it one of the easiest to recommend. While other laptops often focus on sleek and minimalist designs (often at the expense of features or practicality), the Yoga Pro 9i doesn't cut any corners — or ports.\n\nDisclaimer This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. Lenovo had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.\n\nMy Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) review\n\nImage 1 of 4 The clean Lenovo logo and \"communications bar\" are in full display with this laptop. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Most people would be content with just the ports on one side. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) I'd prefer swapping one of those Type-A ports for a Thunderbolt 4 port on the other side, but this is a great I/O selection either way. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) These aren't the slimmest bezels on the block, but the Yoga Pro 9i still feels plenty premium. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDesign ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWhere the Dell 16 Premium (2025) we recently reviewed boasts a controversial, futuristic, and minimalist design, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i absolutely prioritizes function over form.\n\nIt's a familiar two-tier Lenovo design with a rounded base and squared-off lid, creating a unique profile entirely constructed of high-quality aluminum. The Yoga Pro 9i isn't the most refined high-end laptop I've held in my hand and doesn't feature the slimmest display bezel, but it absolutely looks and feels like a premium product.\n\nYou can immediately tell the Yoga Pro 9i is a truly premium laptop, even if it's not the most futuristic design.\n\nAt around 17.9mm thick and 1.93kg heavy, there are certainly beefier 16-inch workstations, but the Yoga Pro 9i's design does make it seem chunkier than it actually is.\n\nAt least you get a ton of ports. There's the 170W DC power port, an HDMI 2.1 port, two full-featured Thunderbolt 4 ports with Power Delivery and DisplayPort functions, a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB Type-A (5GBps) ports, a side-mounted power button, a webcam privacy shutter, and even a full-sized SD card slot. The only things missing are an Ethernet port (Lenovo would've had to make this laptop a fair bit thicker for that) and a Kensington Nano Security Slot, which may actually disappoint some professional users.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDisplay ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nLenovo actually offers two OLED, touchscreen PureSight Pro display options for the Yoga Pro 9i. Both panels boast a 120Hz refresh rate, excellent color accuracy across standard and cinematic gamuts, Dolby Vision HDR and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 1000 support, and the trifecta of TÜV Rheindland Low Blue Light, TÜV Rheinland Flicker-Free, and Eyesafe certifications.\n\nFor an extra $150, though, you can upgrade to a Tandem OLED display with a higher 3.2K resolution (up from 2.8K), even greater color accuracy (especially in the AdobeRGB gamut), twice the display brightness at up to 1,000 nits (compared to 500 nits, and that's not even with HDR enabled), and greater efficiency to boot. Sadly, Lenovo didn't send me that configuration to test, so I can't tell you just how much better that panel is.\n\nThe entry-level screen is still fantastic, though. It's bright, vibrant, and responsive whether I was working, editing photos, gaming, or watching videos. If the Tandem OLED display is even better, it'll be one of the best panels you'll find on a laptop right now.\n\nPerformance ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, a 16-core CPU with fantastic overall performance and solid efficiency. That's backed by up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 (8GB) GPU, but Lenovo sent me the entry-level configuration with an RTX 5050 inside — and it seriously impressed me.\n\nThis laptop is a strong performer in general, backed by Intel Evo guarantees for responsiveness and bolstered by excellent thermal management. The Yoga Pro 9i never got too warm, never suffered from abnormal throttling, and kept quiet enough even under load.\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i was practically guaranteed to deliver great performance, but it still managed to surprise me.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, it's the RTX 5050 that surprised me. Lenovo actually offers a GPU overclocking option, and when enabled the Yoga Pro 9i's RTX 5050 performed well beyond the level I expected, coming within a stone's throw of the far more expensive Dell 16 Premium's RTX 5070 without becoming thermally restrained.\n\nI was able to play Forza Horizon 5 with Extreme settings without any issues, either, never dipping below a stable 60 FPS.\n\nImage 1 of 3 I really like this keyboard, but I'm still not a fan of Lenovo's next key coating. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) There's a lot of power packed into this chassis, but you don't feel it most of the time. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Intel Evo, NVIDIA Studio — this laptop has all the ingredients it needs to tackle any workflow or task. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nBattery life ⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWith an 84Whr battery stashed away inside, the Yoga Pro 9i certainly has plenty of juice... but it's not enough to translate to true all-day battery life. In my testing, the Yoga Pro 9i can deliver around 5 hours of real-time usage — slightly better than the Dell 16 Premium and its larger 99Whr battery, but nothing too impressive.\n\nYou can use up to 100W USB Type-C chargers whenever you're in a pinch, at least. Performance when off the charger is throttled, but is still absolutely what I'd consider \"flagship\" level — especially the graphical oomph.\n\nThis laptop can't claim to boast the greatest endurance, but it's no worse than much of the competition.\n\nKeyboard & touchpad ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI've historically been a huge fan of Lenovo's keyboards, and that still mostly holds true with the Yoga Pro 9i. The layout, key travel, and consistency are all top-notch, and the keyboard doesn't feel too cramped despite having a compact tenkey number pad off to one side (a feature some will love, and others will hate).\n\nAs I noted in my Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i (Gen 9) Aura Edition review, though, the new coating Lenovo puts on its keys isn't my favorite. This is a good keyboard, it's just slippery.\n\nThe touchpad is spacious and responsive with Microsoft Precision drivers, so I have little to complain about there... but I do wish Lenovo would finally embrace haptic touchpads on its premium consumer laptops.\n\nLenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding doesn't mean anything to 99% of people... this laptop still delivers a great software experience, though. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nSoftware & AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i runs Windows 11, and it does so without issue. Drivers are stable and Lenovo hasn't injected an absurd amount of bloatware onto the device.\n\nLenovo didn't pour every feature imaginable into the Yoga Pro 9i, it just focused on delivering a capable, high-quality laptop.\n\nYou also get some extra features courtesy of Lenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding, such as multi-device syncing for photos and files, \"smart\" performance and settings profiles, and Lenovo's \"AI Now\" companion, but the Yoga Pro 9i is not a Copilot+ PC thanks to the weaker NPU of its processor, so it doesn't boast all the latest and greatest artificial intelligence features in Windows.\n\nThat won't make a difference to most people, but it's worth noting this laptop technically isn't on the cutting edge for software.\n\nEverything else ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe display isn't the only reason the Yoga Pro 9i is a monster for entertainment, as it also packs a capable six-speaker system (dual 2W tweeters and quad 2W woofers) with Dolby Atmos support.\n\nI won't go as far as claiming these are the best-sounding speakers in a laptop I've heard, but the Yoga Pro 9i does sound full, loud, and clear. You also get a quad microphone array flanking the great 5MP front-facing camera, which is supported by an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition.\n\nI never had any issues with the Wi-Fi 7 or Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, either. The Yoga Pro 9i doesn't rock any additional features like Human Presence Detection (HPD) or ambient light sensors, or a fingerprint reader, but the basics are covered and they're covered well.\n\nYoga Pro 9i (Gen 10) review: My final thoughts\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i isn't one of the most exciting laptops of 2025, but it is one of my favorites. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\n✅You should buy this if ...\n\nYou need a powerful, feature-packed 16-inch laptop for work and creation.\n\nYou also want that laptop to be good for PC gaming, too.\n\nYou want a laptop with a top-notch OLED display and speaker system.\n\n❌You should not buy this if ...\n\nYou actually care about Windows 11's Copilot+ PC-exclusive features.\n\nYou need a laptop with consistent, easy all-day battery life.\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition may have a slightly ridiculous name, but it's hands-down one of the greatest laptops in the category of \"powerful and premium 16-inch workstations.\"\n\nWhile Apple commits to minimalism and Dell pushes even more aggressively in that direction, Lenovo is delivering an equally capable laptop packed with features and ports — all while undercutting the competition on price. It's a shockingly practical laptop for productivity, creation, entertainment, and gaming.\n\nWhile I do wish the battery could withstand a full day's worth of work without compromise, that doesn't stop this from being one of the best Windows laptops I've tested this year. You can customize your own Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition from $1,869.99 at Lenovo.com, or pull the trigger on the configuration I most recommend for $2,149.99 at Lenovo.com, which upgrades you to that sweet Tandem OLED display and a more powerful RTX 5060 GPU.",

      "headline": "Jensen Huang says China is ‘nanoseconds behind’ the US in chipmaking, calls for reducing US export restrictions on Nvidia's AI chips",
      "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says China is just “nanoseconds behind” the U.S. in chipmaking and that Washington should stop trying to wall off the market. Speaking on the BG2 podcast , Huang argued that allowing companies like Nvidia to sell into China would serve American interests by spreading U.S. technology and extending its geopolitical influence. “We’re up against a formidable, innovative, hungry, fast-moving, underregulated [competitor],” Huang said, talking about the pedigree of China’s engineers and controversial 9-9-6 working culture.\n\nHis comments come as Nvidia hopes to ship its H20 AI GPU to Chinese customers again, following a months-long pause tied to new U.S. export rules. The Commerce Department is understood to have begun issuing licenses for the H20 in August , and Nvidia is already working on a successor chip designed to comply with current restrictions while offering better performance. The company has not confirmed specs, but it would be Nvidia’s second attempt to tailor an AI accelerator specifically for the Chinese marke t since the original A100 and H100 bans took effect.\n\nNVIDIA: OpenAI, Future of Compute, and the American Dream | BG2 w/ Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner - YouTube Watch On\n\nChina, meanwhile, is accelerating its own plans to become self-sufficient. Huawei’s new Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD systems, powered by the company’s Ascend 910B chips , are now shipping in volume. The company has laid out an ambitious roadmap through 2027 with next-gen Ascend silicon that aims to match or exceed current-gen performance. These systems are CUDA-free by design and optimized for Chinese-built software stacks, a shift that puts real pressure on Nvidia’s dominance, which, according to Huang, previously held a 95% market share in China.\n\nChinese hyperscalers are backing that roadmap with capital. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance are all investing in custom silicon, either through internal chip teams or by funding startups. That includes firms like Tencent, which has announced it has fully adapted its infrastructure to support homegrown silicon. Asked what he sees in the near future, Huang said, “They [China] publicly say… they want China to be an open market, they want… companies to come to China and compete in the marketplace… and I believe and I hope that we return to that.”\n\nNvidia’s approach to that is to maintain a foothold in China and play both sides of the geopolitical divide. The H20 may be hobbled compared to the company’s leading chips, but it gives Chinese companies a path to stay within the Nvidia ecosystem — at least for now.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

There are so many to choose from, I almost don't know where to begin.\n\nFirst, this is an Nvidia (NVDA) market. It's a market that will work for the bulls for as long as Nvidia works. If Nvidia is going to chart a course for AI domination, as seen in its new $100 billion OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) deal on Monday, and the stock gets pushed higher, it's bullish for the broader market.\n\n\"I think AI is a real thing,\" Robinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild said on Opening Bid (video above). \"I still think there's a lot of growth in this country. And you're starting to see it in other sectors, ... in aerospace and defense, for example. So I definitely think it's something you have to pay attention to.

I am not surprised he has gained a stock-moving following. He puts in the hard work to find undervalued names.\n\nJackson shared more about his views on Opendoor during his last appearance on Opening Bid — it's worth a watch.\n\nLastly, if you're a bear, it will be hard to stay that way as long as the Fed is cutting rates.

      "headline": "Why Nvidia's Blueprint might be the best tool you'll use for 3D modelling",
      "content": "You may have heard of Nvidia Blueprints, but what are they exactly, and why is the latest addition, the new 3D Object Generation Blueprint, so special?\n\nIf you’ve been following NVIDIA’s AI announcements, you’ll know the company has been talking a lot about Blueprints. These are pre-built AI workflows that bundle together several advanced models into one easy-to-use package. For 3D artists, whether you’re a Blender hobbyist or a professional creating assets for games or film, the new 3D Object Generation Blueprint could be an innovative way to improve your workflow.\n\nTo understand more and why Blueprints matter, I spoke with Michael Fukuyama, Product Manager at Nvidia, who has been leading projects focused on creative, productivity, and generative AI use cases.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nRemoving the obstacles to 3D\n\nAccording to Fukuyama, the appeal of the Blueprint is that it can support a wide range of creators, not just studios with big budgets.\n\n“The 3D Object Generation Blueprint is designed for a wide spectrum of creators, from freelance 3D artists and indie game developers to architects and product designers,” he told me.\n\nThe biggest benefit is speed. Instead of laboriously sourcing stock assets or blocking out rough placeholders, it's possible to generate objects instantly and start refining them.\n\n“An artist working on a ‘city street’ environment could instantly generate 20 candidate objects – benches, lampposts, storefronts, cars – and then decide which to refine. Instead of spending hours searching for stock assets or roughing in placeholders, the artist starts with usable prototypes and can devote more time to creative polish,” Fukuyama explains.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFor hobbyists still learning their way around the best 3D modelling software, this can be especially helpful, as it removes the technical bottleneck and lets you focus on the creative side.\n\nThe tech, explained\n\nSo what makes this possible? Nvidia has combined several different AI tools into one streamlined pipeline.\n\n“The Blueprint stitches together several Nvidia NIM microservices and models into a single pipeline,” Fukuyama says, before explaining (deep breath, here comes the tech): “A large language model powered by the Llama 3.1 8B NIM brainstorms object ideas and prompt inputs for Nvidia SANA Sprint, which generates high-resolution preview images of those objects. From there, the Microsoft TRELLIS NIM microservice converts the chosen previews into 3D assets, now accelerated by 20% thanks to PyTorch optimisations within the NIM. By packaging these components, the Blueprint removes the need for users to wire models together themselves and ensures performance is optimised on RTX GPUs.”\n\nLet me break it down. For creators, that means you don’t need to be an AI engineer to get results. Everything runs locally on an RTX GPU, so if you’ve already been shopping around for the best Nvidia graphics cards for your PC, you’re halfway there.\n\nUsable 3D models\n\nA major selling point of the Blueprint is that the models it produces aren’t just placeholders. They’re functional 3D assets you can drop straight into your workflow.\n\n“‘Fully usable’ refers to the fact that generated assets are starting points towards production, not just rough meshes or flat previews,” Fukuyama tells me. “The Microsoft TRELLIS model creates objects with geometry, textures, and materials that can be imported directly into Blender and other 3D applications. While artists may still want to adjust topology or refine textures for final projects, the output is beyond a placeholder; it’s an asset that can immediately populate a scene, test lighting setups, or serve as a foundation for further detailing.”\n\nFor hobbyists, that could mean skipping the grey boxes and getting textured models right away. For pros, it provides a faster base to build on.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nSupport for all 3D software\n\nBlender is the natural starting point for integration, but Nvidia hasn’t limited the Blueprint to one tool.\n\n“Blender is the starting point because it’s free, open source, and used by a huge range of creators,” Fukuyama says. “But the Blueprint exports assets in standard formats, so artists can move them into tools like Maya, Cinema 4D, or 3ds Max without extra steps.”\n\nThat makes it a useful companion to whichever 3D modelling software you prefer to work with. With so many new generative AI tools emerging, it’s worth asking: why choose this one? For Fukuyama, the key lies in performance and ease of use.\n\n“The differentiator is twofold: performance and packaging,” he says. “Many generative 3D tools exist, but they often require heavy setup, technical know-how, or cloud access. Nvidia AI Blueprints bring together proven models, pre-tuned pipelines, and NIM microservices that are optimised to run locally on RTX GPUs. That means creators get faster iteration – 20% faster with TRELLIS on RTX 50 Series – and keep full control of their data and workflows. By combining generative AI with RTX acceleration, we’re making professional-grade 3D workflows accessible to more creators, directly on their AI PCs and workstations.”\n\nThat local-first approach is especially appealing if you’re running your setup on one of the best laptops for 3D modelling, where GPU power and portability go hand in hand.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nTime to try?\n\nFor anyone building 3D environments, the 3D Object Generation Blueprint is designed to take the grunt work out of the process. Whether you’re learning Blender at home or producing assets for a professional game, the promise is the same: more time for creativity, less time hunting for assets. (Read our Blender tutorials for more on how to get started.)\n\nAnd with Nvidia pushing to make its AI Blueprints run seamlessly on RTX GPUs, it’s clear the company is betting that these workflows will become essential tools for the next generation of digital artists, whether you’re experimenting with the best 3D software, starting in animation, or trying the best game development software to bring your ideas to life.\n\nVisit the Nvidia Blueprints website to learn more.",

      "headline": "Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti Super and RTX 5070 Super TDP leaked — long-rumored RTX 50 Super series GPUs appear in power supply calculator",
      "content": "Nvidia's mid-gen refresh for Blackwell is currently best rumored to launch next year at CES 2026. The RTX 50 Super series was recently caught up in the rumor mill, as some current-gen FE cards were delisted from the chipmaker's website, which was later confirmed to be a stock issue. Now, the informal chatter is set to reignite as Seasonic — a leading PSU manufacturer — has just listed a few RTX 50 Super models on its website, as part of its PSU calculator.\n\nVarious PC hardware companies have power supply calculators on their websites these days to not only help customers estimate the wattage they'll be pulling, but also to pick out an appropriate model subsequently. Hence, in these PSU calculators, one of the most crucial questions is that of the GPU: which graphics card would be in your system? For Seasonic, that list of potential nominees includes the unreleased and unannounced RTX 50 Super cards, at least two of which.\n\nSeasonic doesn't list the specs of a GPU beyond its TDP. Still, the RTX 50 Super series is rumored to feature 3 GB memory modules, effectively increasing the VRAM capacity by 50% while keeping the same number of chips onboard. That means the RTX 5070 Super would potentially have 18 GB (up from 12 GB on the 5070) of memory, and the 5070 Ti Super might rock 24 GB (up from 18 GB on the 5070 Ti), which would make them notable upgrades in what is otherwise a similar spec sheet.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nSeasonic states that the 5070 Super has a 275W TDP, which aligns with the leaked specs, as the additional 25W for the 6GB VRAM makes sense. The same goes for the 5070 Ti Super, which has a 350W TDP listed on the PSU calculator, a 50W increase over the standard 5070 Ti. The RTX 5080 Super is conspicuously missing from the website, but a 415W TDP has been leaked for it before. These numbers align with previous industry rumors, so Seasonic's not necessarily leaking anything new, but rather corroborating existing information.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 50 Super Series*\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Graphics Card GPU Die GPU Cores (CUDA) Memory (Capacity, bus) TDP Price RTX 5090 GB202-300 21,760 32 GB, 512-bit 575 W $2,000 RTX 5080 Super GB203-450 10,752 24 GB, 256-bit ~415 W TBD RTX 5080 GB203-400 10,752 16 GB, 256-bit 360 W $1,000 RTX 5070 Ti Super GB203-350 8,960 24 GB, 256-bit 350 W TBD RTX 5070 Ti GB203-200 8,960 16 GB, 256-bit 300 W $750 RTX 5070 Super GB205-400 6,400 18 GB, 192-bit 275 W TBD RTX 5070 GB205-300-A1 6,144 12 GB, 192-bit 250 W $550 RTX 5060 Ti GB205-300 4,608 8 / 16 GB, 128-bit 180 W $380 / $430 RTX 5060 GB206-250 3,840 8 GB, 128-bit 145 W $300\n\n*Specifications are unconfirmed.\n\nOf course, just because the RTX 50 Super series appears on a random PSU calculator doesn't mean it actually exists, but all signs do point toward it eventually being released. Unannounced GPUs appearing on PSU calculators is actually nothing new, so there's some credence to this model. Nvidia could be waiting till the first anniversary of the Blackwell launch to unveil its mid-gen refresh, which would be at CES next year. More substantial leaks from AIBs should start to emerge around that period, if such a launch is indeed planned.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Others worried cash-strapped startups would be most severely affected, or that the executive order could counterintuitively push more jobs out of the country.\n\nBusiness Insider examined publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to track which tech companies had the most H-1B visa approvals in 2025.\n\nBloomberg, Intel, and Nvidia declined to comment.

The first phase, one gigawatt, is scheduled for the second half of 2026 on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform, named for the late dark-matter astronomer.

Top AI labs like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic frequently talk about this specific topic, especially when unveiling new products and features that cause a demand surge.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to keep up with this trend, NVIDIA recently announced its plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The strategic partnership will allow the ChatGPT maker to build at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters, which will help train and run next-gen AI models and even potentially create the path toward superintelligence.\n\nIt's worth noting that the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems is set to be deployed in the second half of 2026 on the Nvidia Vera Rubin platform. The chipmaker's first $10 billion investment in OpenAI will be made once both parties reach an agreement for OpenAI to purchase NVIDIA chips. However, reports suggest that NVIDIA's first $10 billion investment will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed.\n\nWhile making the announcement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated:\n\n“Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”\n\nAt the beginning of the year, OpenAI unveiled its $500 billion Stargate project, designed to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States to power its AI advances. Consequently, Microsoft lost its exclusive cloud provider status for OpenAI, though it still holds the right of first refusal.\n\nNVIDIA and OpenAI are set to finalize the new partnership details in the coming weeks, potentially addressing the ChatGPT maker's cloud compute woes.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

We're so limited right now in the services we can offer. There is so much more demand than what we can do.\"\n\nThe executive further elaborated that the compute constraints would place OpenAI in a tough spot within the next two years, forcing it to make painful tradeoffs. He indicated that the company might be forced to choose between curing cancer through research or providing free education to everyone on earth with 5-10 gigawatts of compute power.\n\nFollow Windows Central on Google News to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!"

Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nHello! Jim Cramer is known to take some heat for his stock picks, but it was his bashing of GameStop's 2021 meme rally that led him to hire a bodyguard.\n\nIn today's big story, Jimmy Kimmel returns to the late-night airways.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nMarkets: With rate cuts rolling in, are you wondering how to invest? Wall Street has some ideas.\n\nTech: Nvidia and OpenAI now have 100 billion reasons to help each other succeed.\n\nBusiness: There still isn't a deal to keep TikTok in the US, but here's what one could look like.\n\nBut first, give a big round of applause (or don't) for my next guest.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nKimmel's comeback\n\nRandy Holmes/ABC via Getty Images\n\nIt turns out \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" isn't going anywhere just yet.\n\nLess than a week after being suspended \"indefinitely\" over comments regarding Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel is scheduled to return to late-night television tonight.\n\n(If you're completely out of the loop, we recapped all the Kimmel drama and why it matters in Friday's newsletter.)\n\nIn a statement that probably went through more lawyers and PR people than I can count, Disney said it pulled Kimmel off the air \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.\" Kimmel's comments were \"ill-timed\" and \"insensitive,\" the House of Mouse added\n\nHowever, after some \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,\" Disney is bringing the show back.\n\nReactions from both ends of the spectrum quickly followed. Other late-night hosts welcomed his return. Some high-profile celebs and politicians celebrated the move as a win for free speech (California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Zohran Mamdani). Others felt Disney caved (Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet).\n\nKimmel's return comes with a slight caveat: Some viewers might still be unable to watch the show. That's because Sinclair, which played a key role in Kimmel's initial suspension, said it would not air the show on the 39 ABC affiliate stations it owns or controls.\n\nSinclair, which is the largest ABC affiliate, said it will air news programming instead and that discussions with ABC about the show's return are \"ongoing.\" Sinclair had issued a list of demands it wanted met before bringing the show back.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chair Brendan Carr referred BI to comments he made earlier Monday, in which he reiterated his agency's goal of trying to \"empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities.\"\n\nCarr, who last week said, \"This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" also pushed back on the idea that the FCC threatened to revoke Disney and ABC's licenses if they didn't fire Kimmel.\n\nIn the meantime, Disney finds itself in a tricky situation.\n\nOn the one hand, reinstating Kimmel is bound to make plenty of people happy. More than 400 celebrities signed a letter in support of Kimmel. There were also calls to boycott Disney due to the suspension.\n\nBut those who felt Kimmel's suspension was justified aren't likely to be happy about his return. (Whether they were supporters of Disney in the first place remains to be seen.) And even those who welcome Kimmel's return might still resent Disney for initially suspending him.\n\nAnd then there's the question of late night. The TV model for late-night shows was already fragile long before last week. But now that Kimmel and his show have become a lightning rod, any decision about the show going forward will be viewed with a magnifying glass and likely lead to more controversy.\n\n3 things in markets\n\nBank of America's Merrill and Wells Fargo are offering spot bitcoin ETF's to some of their clients as the investment vehicle surges in demand, Bloomberg Reported Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nCrypto prices tanked after hordes of traders rushed to liquidate their positions.

Nvidia and OpenAI are teaming up in an AI infrastructure deal that has the chipmaker investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI. This includes OpenAI constructing \"at least 10 gigawatts\" of AI data centers running Nvidia systems. Nvidia's stock jumped as much as 5% on news of the agreement, helping to push the S&P 500 to a fresh record high. And in case you're wondering how much $100 billion really is, BI's Katie Notopoulos puts things into perspective.\n\nThe jobs most — and least — likely to be transformed by generative AI. Indeed created the GenAI Skill Transformation Index to measure how generative AI will affect jobs or certain skills. From its findings, one overall message was clear: No job is totally immune, but not all jobs are equally exposed.\n\nThe H-1B fee is coming at a terrible time for Big Tech. IT outsourcing giants and tech companies were already navigating tariff threats, generative AI, and more. Now the new rules could upend their staffing models, according to analysts at TD Cowen who assessed the potential damage of Trump's new H-1B visa fee. Meanwhile, unionized Google employees held a press conference urging their employer to speak out against the matter.\n\n3 things in business\n\nTikTok (US version). The deal — which could land by the end of the week, according to the White House — could see a consortium of US investors, including Larry Ellison and potentially the Murdochs, buy TikTok's US assets. Post-sale, Oracle, which already serves as TikTok's data and security provider in the US, would also control TikTok's algorithm in partnership with the US government.\n\nMeet your new matchmaker: AI.

That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power.\n\nAs such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres.\n\nThe two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket.\n\nOnce this most recent deal is finalised, sources close to the company claim the plan is for Nvidia to invest an initial sum of $10 billion, followed by a hardware rollout sometime towards the end of 2026. The first gigawatt of power will likely take to the stage of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin AI compute platform, which was first revealed back in March.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a statement that it was all about maintaining a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded field, saying, \"Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.\"\n\nBut Nvidia spending money on OpenAI so OpenAI can then buy Nvidia hardware has raised some concerns; if this flow of cash looks a little circular to you, you're not the only one concerned about the potential shape of things to come.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon commented, \"On the one hand this [deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built. On the other hand the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Still though, the proposed 10 gigawatt data centres will demand power equivalent to the needs of 8 million U.S. households; despite Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's suggestion that AI customers 'pace themselves' and other major big tech players looking to nuclear to meet AI's power demands, there may come a time when such a power imbalance can no longer be ignored."

The update sees this streaming and screen recording stable gain a nifty new plugin manager, change a few of its default settings and expand its support for NVIDIA RTX effects.\n\nThe new plugin manager is described as “basic” because it is: it shows a list of installed plugins with a checkbox to enable/disable, but ‘Browse’ and ‘Update’ options are greyed out (those options being there suggests it will be possible to find and install plugins in OBS directly).\n\nOBS Studio 3.20 increases the default bitrate from 2500 to 6000 Kbps.\n\nThe old value was decided upon a decade ago, and expectations in quality have shifted. OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.\n\nUsers with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.\n\nHybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.\n\nOn Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.\n\nOther notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:\n\nOpt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)\n\nExperimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs\n\nAudio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc\n\n--disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed\n\nPlugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded\n\nBeyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.\n\nThough a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.\n\nHow to Install OBS Studio 32.0\n\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).\n\nOn Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.\n\nThere’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).\n\nTo install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\n\nThen, install OBS Studio using apt :\n\nsudo apt install obs-studio\n\nFinally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team."

      "headline": "Intel drops day zero game driver support for chips released last year — last-gen iGPUs on 14th-gen Core and older CPUs already put on the backburner of legacy software support",
      "content": "Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.\n\nThis announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.\n\nWhile an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.\n\nStill, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.\n\nNevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.\n\nEven though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nSep 23 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is stepping further into artificial intelligence with a plan to back OpenAI with as much as $100 billion. The initiative focuses on building large-scale data centers powered by Nvidia's chips, reinforcing the company's position at the heart of the AI supply chain.\n\nThe announcement sparked excitement, but the stock didn't hold its gains. After closing at a record $183.61 on Monday, Nvidia slipped 2% to $180 on Tuesday. Investors are still weighing how quickly the partnership will boost earnings.\n\nOpenAI intends to deploy around 10 gigawatts of data center capacity using Nvidia systems, including millions of GPUs. Analysts see the move as both strategic and ambitious. William Blair's Sebastien Naji said Nvidia's strong cash position allows it to accelerate adoption of AI hardware while supporting a broader ecosystem.\n\nOthers struck a more measured tone. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree kept a Buy rating and a $220 price target but said the financial impact may take time to show, since OpenAI already factored heavily into previous forecasts.\n\nThe deal follows Nvidia's recent multibillion-dollar tie-up with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), pointing to a push beyond chip sales into the infrastructure enabling AI at scale.",

      "content": "Yesterday, Micron reported its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results , beating the consensus and providing interesting comments on its upcoming HBM technology. During the earnings call, Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO of Micron, confirmed that HBM4—the company's next-generation memory—will be available next year with several enhancements over the base HBM4 JEDEC specification . \"Micron Technology's HBM4 12-high remains on track to support customer platform ramps, even as the performance requirements for HBM4 bandwidth and pin speeds have increased. We have recently shipped customer samples of our HBM4 with industry-leading bandwidth exceeding 2.8 TB/s and pin speeds over 11 Gbps.\" The JEDEC specification for HBM4 is 2 TB/s bandwidth and 8 Gb/s pin transfer across a 2048-bit interface. Micron is pushing this to 11 Gb/s, resulting in 40% higher bandwidth at 2.8 TB/s.There is a simple reason why this is the case. Customers like NVIDIA are asking HBM makers to create a more performant HBM memory to keep up with the exponential growth that their compute dies are experiencing. To satisfy these requirements, Micron is moving beyond JEDEC specifications. \"We believe Micron Technology's HBM4 outperforms all competing HBM4 products, delivering industry-leading performance as well as best-in-class power efficiency. Our proven 1-gamma DRAM, innovative and power-efficient HBM4 design, in-house advanced CMOS base die, and advanced packaging innovations are key differentiators enabling this best-in-class product,\" said Sanjay.\"For HBM4E, Micron Technology will offer standard products as well as the option for customization of the base logic die,\" confirmed Micron CEO. As we reported earlier , NVIDIA and AMD accelerators will utilize a customized HBM memory for the first time. In an HBM stack, consisting of stacked DRAM dies up to a 12-high, connected with TSVs, there is the possibility of embedding an optional base die with customized logic/accelerator circuitry tailored to a specific need. It appears that NVIDIA and AMD are not only exploring this option to gain more performance, but are also actively working on an implementation with a custom base that will push these accelerators ahead of any third-party ASIC solution. The custom base die will likely be a data processing/logic die that helps route data packets more efficiently, cutting latency and improving performance.",

      "headline": "Nvidia and OpenAI partnership is a catalyst for enterprise AI growth, says Wedbush’s Dan Ives",
      "content": "Good morning. One of the largest investments in artificial intelligence to date could further accelerate enterprise AI adoption.\n\nOpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and AI chip leader Nvidia announced a strategic partnership on Monday, with Nvidia committing up to $100 billion to support OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure—including investments in power capacity and data centers. The agreement entails deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia-powered systems—amounting to millions of graphics processing units (GPUs)—to develop and run advanced AI models. The first phase is expected to go live in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe two companies will jointly optimize their development roadmaps for OpenAI’s software and models, and for Nvidia’s hardware and software platforms. The investment and infrastructure partnership powers “the next era of intelligence,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, added that the partnership will “create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses.”\n\nThis announcement further strengthens the relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia as leaders at the forefront of the AI revolution, while providing OpenAI with substantial funding at lower costs by reducing its credit risk, Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a Tuesday note to investors.\n\n\n\n“This speaks to our view that the next three to six months will be defined by the second, third, and fourth derivatives of the AI Revolution playing out,” according to the analysts.\n\n\n\nDan Ives, managing director at Wedbush, told me the tiered derivatives refer to the other areas of tech that will “benefit from the trillions spent in the AI Revolution.” He added: “Big Tech will dominate, but these other areas are the winners in software, chips, energy, and infrastructure.”\n\n\n\nWhile there are worries about an AI bubble and stretched valuations, the analysts continue to view this as a “1996 moment” for the tech world. “This is still the early days of the AI Revolution in our view,” Ives told me. “The tech bubble was 1999/2000, and this is still early days—a 1996 moment.”\n\nSpending and surging enterprise use cases across industries are creating a group of emerging AI leaders, according to Ives.\n\nLast week, OpenAI’s economic research team, alongside Harvard economist David Deming, released research analyzing 1.5 million ChatGPT conversations to track usage patterns since its launch. The study found that roughly 30% of use is work-related while 70% is personal, with both categories growing over time—highlighting ChatGPT’s dual role as a productivity tool and a source of value in daily life, according to the researchers.\n\n“The early findings are fascinating and point to real shifts in how AI is integrated into everyday life,” OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Especially happy to see the gender gap close.”\n\nBy mid-2025, ChatGPT’s early gender gaps had narrowed significantly, with user demographics coming to resemble the broader adult population. In January 2024, 37% of users had typically feminine names; by July, that share had grown to over half (52%).\n\n\n\nAs OpenAI and Nvidia join forces, their landmark investment signals a far-reaching impact across industries.\n\nSheryl Estrada\n\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nLeaderboard\n\nDavid Croxville was appointed CFO of C1, a technology solutions and services company. Croxville brings more than 30 years of experience. Most recently, he served as EVP and CFO of NTT DATA Services in the Americas, where he led finance, procurement, real estate, and IT across 44 countries, and completed more than 10 acquisitions, including Dell Services.\n\nCornelis (Carlo) Broos was promoted to CFO of Cibus, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBUS), a biotechnology company, according to an SEC filing. Broos has served as interim CFO of Cibus since October 2024 and previously held the position of SVP of finance. He joined Cibus in 2011. Before joining the company, Broos held finance leadership positions at Syngenta Europe Africa Middle East, Syngenta Netherlands and Belgium, Advanta, and Deloitte Netherlands.\n\nBig Deal\n\nFortune released its 2025 Change the World list this morning, featuring 50 companies that have integrated social problem-solving into their business models. Their leaders recognize there’s profit to be made by having a positive impact on people and the planet—whether directly, through the sale of their products and services, or indirectly, as their actions help build a stronger talent pool, attract more customers, and strengthen the economic resilience of their communities.\n\nAmong the companies on the list is Deloitte, which recently helped Brazil develop hydrogen power by creating a model to work across various supply-chain scenarios, for example. Mastercard is also featured; its Strive program, launched in 2021, helps micro and small business owners access affordable credit and digital tools to manage their finances. In the U.S., Strive has facilitated $45 billion in loans and reached more than 1.6 million small businesses.

      "content": "NVIDIA is today open-sourcing its Audio2Face 3D animation model, allowing everyone to become the owner of their own digital avatar. The company has trained its Audio2Face technology to produce characters that are true to life, utilizing generative video models for facial expressions, text-to-speech models for human output, and large language models for actual conversations, all combined in a single pipeline to create a digital avatar. All of these stages are fed by analyzing acoustic input, which features characteristics such as intonation and phonemes, and are then translated into a stream of animation data. That data is later mapped to facial expressions, where the mood of the avatar can be interpreted simply by looking at it. The entire data pipeline can be either an offline scripted content or you can feed the model using live data for real-time lip-synching and facial expressions.Additionally, NVIDIA is open-sourcing the entire Audio2Face stack, which includes the model itself and the SDK, so everyone, from game developers to home enthusiasts, can use it in any possible way. NVIDIA is now open-sourcing the entire training framework, allowing anyone to create their own avatar version with customized features. The company even provided Autodesk Maya and Unreal Engine plugins, allowing 3D workloads to integrate this generative model immediately.Game developers are increasingly treating Audio2Face as a production-ready shortcut to believable facial performance—a tool that automatically converts dialogue into expressive, multilingual lip-sync and facial animation, allowing artists to skip tedious frame-by-frame work and focus on storytelling. Studios from toolmakers like Reallusion, as well as developers such as Survios and The Farm 51, say it speeds up pipelines, frees up animators for higher-value polish, and makes previously impractical ideas achievable, all while keeping characters feeling authentic and emotionally grounded.

      "headline": "Microsoft develops breakthrough chip cooling method — microfluidic channels can cut peak temps by up to 65%, outperform conventional cold plates by up to 3x",
      "content": "As data center-grade processors are getting hotter, companies invent more and more creative ways to cool them down. As Nvidia and its partners are reportedly experimenting with new cold plates and immersion cooling for next-generation AI GPUs, Microsoft is proposing to etch microfluidic channels on the back of an actual chip to reduce its peak temperature by up to 65%, making it three times more efficient than cold plates.\n\nMicrosoft says it has developed a cooling system that routes fluid directly into microchannels etched on the back of the silicon die to guide the coolant to high-heat regions inside the chip. Flowing liquid inside the chip greatly reduces the efficiency of the whole setup, as liquid can almost 'touch' hot spots inside the processor, whereas in the case of more traditional liquid cooling or even immersion cooling, heat emerges several layers away from the coolant.\n\nTo optimize thermal routing, Microsoft worked with Swiss startup Corintis, which used artificial intelligence to refine channel geometry. Rather than simple straight lines, the final layout mimics patterns found in nature, such as leaf veins or butterfly wings, to guide fluid more efficiently. Also, microchannels must be small enough to function effectively but not so deep that they weaken the silicon, risking mechanical failure.\n\nHowever, etching microfluid channels can only be done as a separate sequence during chip manufacturing, which means additional steps and costs. Alternatively, Microsoft proposes to produce a microfluidic heat transfer structure separately and cool down one or two chips using the structure, according to a patent. Such integration requires new packaging methods to prevent coolant leaks and maintain durability.\n\nBy now, Microsoft has discovered the right coolant fluid, developed precise etching techniques, and managed to integrate these into chip production. Therefore, Microsoft considers its technology ready for full-scale production within Microsoft's chip development pipeline. Third-party customers may license the technology from Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC.\n\nIntroducing microfluidic cooling: a breakthrough in chip cooling technology - YouTube Watch On\n\n\"Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space,\" said Judy Priest, corporate vice president and chief technical officer of Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft. \"But we needed to prove the technology and the design worked, and then the very next thing I wanted to do was test reliability.\"\n\nMicrosoft is testing the cooling solution on servers running simulated Teams workloads, where uneven heat loads across many services are handled more efficiently, enabling higher burst performance, which helps to reduce the number of servers that otherwise sit idle when not in use during peak loads that tend to happen on the hour or on the half-hour.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Compared to cold plates, the cooling performance improvement was as much as three times, depending on workload and setup. The method also enables cooling without relying on ultra-low coolant temperatures, saving energy otherwise needed for chilling, Microsoft noted.\n\nMicrosoft has been experimenting with its microfluidic channels liquid cooling technology for years and demonstrated the first prototype in 2022, so by now, the company has plenty of lab experience with the technology. Yet, Microsoft is not the only company to develop methods to produce embedded coolant channels inside a chip or chip package. IBM also has appropriate patents.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "headline": "Trump’s Effort to Pick America’s Corporate Winners Will End Badly",
      "content": "In his second term, US President Donald Trump has abandoned America’s free-market tradition, importing the failed playbook of state-controlled economies. Far from delivering prosperity, heavy-handed government interference will throw good money after bad, distort competition, and prop up failing firms.\n\nSEOUL – For at least the last 150 years, state intervention in picking individual industries and firms to support has been shown to undermine productivity and weaken economic performance. When political considerations outweigh sound commercial judgment, companies may be compelled to keep unprofitable factories open, maintain loss-making activities, favor government-owned suppliers over private vendors, or appoint unqualified but politically connected individuals to leadership positions.\n\nBy contrast, when private companies are inefficient or producing goods people do not want, they exit the market, and more productive companies enter. The profit motive drives businesses to recruit capable employees, produce quality goods that meet demand, innovate, and embrace cutting-edge technologies. When subject to political influence or control, companies generally have weaker incentives to pursue these goals precisely because government ownership shields them from competition.\n\nIn the United States, as in most advanced economies, the private sector has long been the primary driver of GDP growth. With governments playing a relatively limited role – establishing regulatory frameworks, supporting basic research and innovation, and curbing monopolies – competition has flourished, delivering decades of economic prosperity.\n\nBut under President Donald Trump, the US – once an avatar of free-market capitalism – has broken with this tradition. Since the start of his second term, Trump has repeatedly meddled in private-sector decision-making. His administration has targeted law firms, universities, think tanks, semiconductor and battery manufacturers, media companies, research, and more. And, taking a page from the playbook of state-controlled communist economies, his administration has gone even further, moving from intimidation to direct government ownership of private firms. In June, for example, Japan’s Nippon Steel was permitted to acquire US Steel but had to grant the federal government a “golden share,” giving American policymakers veto power over the company’s business plans.\n\nEven before Trump’s intervention, Nippon Steel had pledged to make major investments in US Steel, retain all employees, and honor newly negotiated contracts with union-represented workers. The Trump administration’s added demands thus send a mixed message: while it courts foreign investment, it erects unnecessary barriers.\n\nTrump’s deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD illustrates this contradiction. In April, the administration halted the sale of advanced semiconductors to China on national-security grounds. Yet by July, Nvidia and AMD were permitted to resume sales, provided they hand the US government 15% of the revenues.\n\nSecure your copy of PS Quarterly: What Works? Magazine_What_Works-Q32025.

SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nThe administration’s deal with Intel is even more brazen. In August, Trump announced that the US government had acquired a 10% stake in the company, paid for with $5.7 billion Intel had already been promised under the CHIPS and Science Act and another $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program. The agreement also effectively shackles Intel to its loss-making foundry while giving the government the option to buy an additional 5% if the foundry is ever sold.\n\nNotably, by converting anticipated CHIPS grants into equity, the agreement does not provide Intel with new government funds. Meanwhile, private shareholders bear the cost of dilution: the US government purchased its stake at $20.47 per share – well below the $24.80 closing price on the eve of Trump’s announcement.\n\nAlthough the government will hold no seats on Intel’s board, even without formal representation, the administration’s shadow will loom over the company’s decision-making. Policymakers could lean on Nvidia, AMD, and other firms to buy semiconductors from Intel, pressure the company to build new factories in unprofitable locations, or force it to hire workers chosen for political loyalty rather than competence.\n\nIntel’s prolonged decline underscores the poor economics driving Trump’s investment. In the 1990s, the company was the leading semiconductor manufacturer; in 2000, it even briefly became the world’s second most valuable company. Today, however, it doesn’t even crack the top 15 chipmakers by market capitalization.\n\nIntel has also been the single largest beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, using federal funds to develop new production facilities in Arizona. But construction faced repeated delays, with executives blaming a shortage of skilled labor. Similarly, an Ohio plant already under construction has had its completion date pushed back from 2025 to 2030.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Trump’s Intel deal looks especially misguided. What the company truly needs is new financing to service its existing obligations, swollen by years of heavy losses, and fund the turnaround plan developed by its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. SoftBank, the Japanese investment conglomerate, recently announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, though whether that move reflects genuine confidence in Intel’s future or an effort to curry favor during tense tariff negotiations between the US and Japan remains an open question.\n\nIndustrial policy is often said to be about “picking winners.” But given Intel’s recent performance, the Trump administration seems intent on picking losers. While few dispute the importance of steel production, or that semiconductors will drive future growth, Trump’s brand of state capitalism does little to strengthen either industry or the broader US economy. Instead, it exposes the dangers of government meddling in markets: wasted taxpayer money, distorted incentives, weakened competition, and less dynamism and innovation.",

      "headline": "Will a win-win for Nvidia and OpenAI end up as a lose-lose for the rest of us?",
      "content": "Dystopian visions of artificial intelligence (AI) feature bots breaking free of human control and running amok. But what if the AI industry itself goes wild? While US investors must watch out for an outsized investment bubble, AI users everywhere need to worry about a web of convergent business interests that could plausibly cramp market rivalry.\n\nOn Monday, news broke of Nvidia’s deal with OpenAI that could see the world’s top AI chip company invest up to $100 billion in the firm behind ChatGPT, one tenth at a time.\n\nNvidia is the world’s most valuable company, with a monopolistic hold on its chip market, while OpenAI leads the global chatbot race with a claimed 700 million weekly active users. On the face of it, this is a clever way for Nvidia to boost demand for its chips as OpenAI invests heavily in data centres. For every gigawatt of capacity, the AI world’s dominant chip-seller might pump in $10 billion.\n\nDays earlier, Nvidia said it would put $5 billion into Intel. As for Sam Altman’s OpenAI, it recently struck a mega deal with Oracle to lease AI infrastructure. For a 2015 startup with revenues placed at only around $13 billion, that’s quite some deal-making. It speaks of how explosively today’s ‘smart money’ expects AI to grow.\n\nAn early bet-placer was Microsoft, which invested over $10 billion in OpenAI soon after its chatbot stormed our digital gadgets. Since Altman’s effort to carve its business subsidiary apart from its non-profit parent has not yet taken formal shape, its control structure remains hazy. What is visible, all the same, is a web of alliances that AI users have reason to be wary of.\n\nAlso Read | China is more eager to use Nvidia’s AI chips than it lets on\n\nWhat’s touted as a win-win for businesses need not work out well for customers. While Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang has spoken of how both his company and Altman’s will gain from their pact, critics point out the ‘circular dynamics’ of one firm funding another’s purchases of its wares.\n\nIf this gives the deal an artificial air, the fact that OpenAI will partly use its closely held shares as a currency to create backup infra adds to its opacity. OpenAI is reportedly valued at some $500 billion, but reports say that the equity acquired by Nvidia would have no voting rights, assuring Altman executive leeway from his megacorp allies.\n\nThe fortunes of OpenAI and its allies hinge on leadership of a blistering new age of AI-driven gains. For all the hype, however, the impact of AI on corporate productivity has been modest so far, like the learning curve of its offerings.\n\nIn a dream scenario, AI will put economies on sizzling growth paths and generate vast revenues off a global user base to justify the mega-sums being invested in it. But this is yet to be tested and billions could end up wasted in pursuit of a grand fantasy.\n\nEither way, if the ‘groupthink’ of a closely aligned quest for AI market success gets in the way of true competition, AI users could be dealt a bad deal.\n\nIn a market that serves users best, various AI visions would compete fiercely for both users and resources—with their aims and rewards free of each other’s. True, Big Tech players like Google have competitive AI offerings (and even allies), but OpenAI’s web of alliances, some of it blessed by the White House, could emerge as a collusive force to reckon with if mass-market AI becomes a winner-takes-all game.\n\nIndian AI is in infancy and Chinese AI untrustworthy. If smaller AI players get squeezed out by capital intensity and network effects, we risk a global failure of ‘intelligence,’ with its artificial version crafted for the rest of us but controlled by a few.",

      "content": "Disney CEO Bob Iger is fighting to keep hedge fund directors off the company's board\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger is fighting to keep hedge fund directors off the company's board Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger is fighting to keep hedge fund directors off the company's board Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nHi! Did you catch Jimmy Kimmel last night? The late-night host's show returned after a brief suspension over comments regarding Charlie Kirk. In case you missed it, or you're in a market where local affiliates are still refusing to air the show, we've got a rundown of all the highlights.\n\nKimmel teared up, explaining that he never intended to make light of Kirk's death. And he called political efforts to sway networks and affiliates from airing the show \"un-American,\" noting it wasn't just about comedy.\n\nLate-night hosts, including Kimmel, made one thing very clear, wrote veteran late-night watcher Cheryl Teh: They'll be thorns in Trump's side for as long as they can be.\n\nIn today's big story, navigating Kimmel's return could be the last big test for Disney CEO Bob Iger's legacy.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nMarkets: The Wall Street firms that rely the most on H-1B visas.\n\nTech: Internal data shows how Amazon's Q Developer lags behind rivals.\n\nBusiness: Trust me when I tell you that you won't be able to guess corporate America's new favorite C-suite title.\n\nBut first, a legacy in question.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nMouse trap\n\nDisney CEO, Bob Iger. Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\nWill Bob Iger leave Disney a Magic Kingdom or a Haunted Mansion?\n\nDespite spending nearly two decades running Disney, what happens over the next few weeks could ultimately define Iger's legacy.\n\nThe Jimmy Kimmel saga has put the Disney CEO in the middle of a culture war involving high-profile celebrities, a government agency, and President Donald Trump.\n\nIger's handling of the continued fallout from Kimmel's suspension-turned-reinstatement could cement how the legendary executive is remembered, write BI's Lucia Moses, Madeline Berg, and Tim Paradis.\n\nIt won't be easy, as Disney has managed to enrage both sides of the aisle. Kimmel supporters are upset he was suspended in the first place, while his detractors are mad he was let back on the air.\n\nAnd we're not just talking about Disney adults and anonymous internet commentators here. Some players on both sides of the argument hold significant power over the House of Mouse.\n\nCelebrities, who have mostly backed Kimmel, are Disney's lifeblood. If the company were to lose creative community's support, that's a problem. It's tough to create shows and movies if you don't have people willing to make them with you.\n\nThat's not to say you want to pick a fight with the other side. The two local TV station owners that refuse to air Kimmel's show, Nexstar and Sinclair, oversee roughly 25% of ABC stations. It's the latest in the growing tension between Disney and its local broadcasters, writes BI's James Faris.\n\nThey also have the backing of FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who called local TV stations' resistance to national programmers \"a good thing.\"\n\nA 26-year-old man was detained by the Anaheim Police Department for indecent exposure and for being under the influence of a controlled substance. Image Group LA via Getty Images\n\nIt's a marked change from when Iger was looking to take the company a little over a year ago.\n\nBack in April 2024, Iger made clear Disney was about entertaining, not advancing \"any kind of agenda.\" Shaking Disney of the so-called \"woke\" label has been a priority since his return as CEO in 2022.\n\nHe's also got plenty of other things on his plate without Kimmelgate. There's the matter of who will take over as CEO when Iger is set to step down at the end of 2026. It's something he's keen to get right after the debacle that was the Bob Chapek era.\n\nThat process will likely need to be sidelined as Iger navigates the Kimmel situation. Both sides will closely watch the show's future, and each decision will be scrutinized for its underlying political meaning, even if there isn't one.\n\nIger will also have to endure more criticism, like the one he received from his former boss, ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who blasted the decision to suspend Kimmel.\n\nTo Disney and Iger's credit, they might have found some common ground for both sides. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to raise the monthly price of some of its Disney+ subscriptions by $2 to $3 next month.\n\nBecause if there is anything we can all agree on, it's getting annoyed over the price of our streaming services going up.\n\n3 things in markets\n\nGold is having its own gold rush. The precious metal is having its best year since the 1970s, with recent returns ramping up following the Fed's latest rate cut. That success didn't happen overnight, though. BI's Joe Ciolli breaks down the three main macro drivers propelling gold's hot streak.\n\nHow President Trump's $100,000 H-1B affects Wall Street. Silicon Valley isn't the only sector reeling from the new H-1B fee. Many Wall Street banks rely heavily on the program. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon said he expects pushback on Trump's plan, adding that he supports \"merit-based immigration.\" BI crunched the data to find out which financial firms could be impacted the most.\n\nThe insane schedule of investing personality Jim Cramer. Running on about four hours of sleep, the \"Mad Money\" host wakes up every day at 3:15 a.m. to brush up on the market before his workout. He also combs through about 700 emails a day.\n\n3 things in tech\n\nAWS CEO Matt Garman Amazon\n\nAmazon's Q Developer isn't doing so hot. The online retailer's AI coding assistant saw revenue fall behind rivals in its first year, according to internal documents reviewed by BI. Amazon also has plans to refine Q's branding as the company's employees appear to favor external products like Cursor over its tech.\n\nThe Zuckerberg playbook for pleasing Republicans. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg addressed Republicans' complaints of anti-conservative bias on Meta's platforms by shifting the blame to the Biden administration in a letter to Congress. Google just copied the play and took it one step further.\n\nThe one thing OpenAI's $100 billion deal with Nvidia can't guarantee. The deal gives OpenAI a significant leg up in the AI race, providing vital access to GPUs. However, it can't guarantee access to electricity, which remains an industry-wide challenge.\n\n3 things in business\n\nGetty Images; Tyler Le/BI\n\nSpooky season is here, and so is \"hybrid creep.\" Many employers are gradually increasing the number of days workers must show up at the office. A new survey, commissioned by Owl Labs, shows 34% of employees must be on-site four days a week, up from 23% in 2023. The subtle trend could signal the end of flexible work at some companies.\n\nTrust is dead. Can the \"Chief Trust Officer\" revive it? Some companies have added a new position to the C-suite: the chief trust officer. They're tasked with protecting against data breaches, answering questions about their companies' use of AI, and building trust — a challenge since trust is a complex emotion and not a metric.\n\nTylenol's groundhog day. Tylenol's owner Johnson & Johnson pioneered crisis management with its response to the \"Tylenol murders\" in 1982, when seven people died from taking Tylenol capsules that someone laced with potassium cyanide. Tylenol is now staring down another PR crisis after President Trump called it unsafe. Communications experts broke down what worked for J&J then and how it could play out now.\n\nIn other news\n\nMeta just missed a senator's deadline for submitting records about its AI chatbot policies for kids.\n\nDiddy's kids, mom, and pals come out in force to plead for leniency: 'Please let my father out of jail!'\n\nI've had an executive Costco membership for 10 years.

It's more about enabling a level playing field so that other people can compete,\" he said.\n\nIt plans to sell the software directly to enterprises on a consumption basis and through revenue-sharing partnerships with cloud providers.\n\nThe company's strategy has attracted investors betting on a multi-vendor future for AI hardware. Sam Fort, partner at DFJ Growth, compared Modular to \"VMware for the AI era\", which supported companies to work across CPUs.\n\n\"Modular is trying to create the AI hypervisor that will allow you to port workloads across different vendors,\" Fort said.\n\nThe company, with about 130 employees, plans to use the new capital to expand its engineering and go-to-market team.

Reuters was first to report the news.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, CEO Michael Intrator reiterated the continued AI infrastructure demand he is seeing from clients.\n\n“The market is incredibly behind on its ability to deliver the infrastructure that's being demanded. As an industry, we continue to underestimate the demand for things,” Intrator said.\n\nHe also described the expanded contract with OpenAI as a sign that CoreWeave is diversifying its revenue away from Microsoft, which was once OpenAI's exclusive infrastructure provider and accounted for 60 per cent of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024.\n\n“The opportunity to go about diversifying our clients with some really wonderful, well-known, creditworthy customers is very exciting.

      "content": "HighPoint on Thursday introduced its Rocket 7638D PCIe 5.0 switch card that is designed to enable Nvidia's GPUDirect interconnection between AI GPUs and NVMe storage devices. The device is designed to speed up AI training and inference workloads when operating with software that fully support GPUDirect.\n\nThe latest GPUs from Nvidia (starting from A100) support GPUDirect technologies that enable direct data transfers between GPUs and other devices, such as SSD or network interfaces, bypassing the CPU and system memory to increase performance and free CPU resources for other workloads. However, GPUDirect requires support both from the GPU and from a PCIe switch that supports P2P DMA capability, but not all PCIe Gen5 switches support this feature, which is where switch cards come into play.\n\nHighPoint's Rocket 7638D switch card packs the Broadcom PEX 89048 switch enabling system integrators to build systems with GPUDirect capability. The adapter features 48 PCIe 5.0 lanes: 16 lanes to connect to host, 16 lanes to connect to external GPU box using a CDFP CopprLink connector, and 16 lanes are dedicated to internal NVMe storage devices using MCIO 8i connectors. The MCIO ports support up to 16 NVMe drives, enabling configurations with up to 2PB of high-performance storage.\n\nThe Rocker 7638D adapter enables GPUDirect Storage workflows that avoid host CPU and RAM entirely and provide predictable bandwidth (up to 64 GB/s) and latency when paired with compatible software, which includes operating system, GPU drivers, and filesystem. The device (or rather systems that it enables) is particularly useful in scenarios involving large-scale training datasets that use plenty of storage.\n\nSince the the Broadcom PEX 89048 switch chip contains an Arm-based CPU, it is completely independent and self managed, so it is compatible with both Arm and x86 platforms. The adapter works out of the box with all major operating systems, without the need for special drivers or additional software installation.\n\nThe Rocket 7638D includes field-service features such as VPD tracking for hardware and firmware matching and a utility that monitors health status and PCIe link performance. These tools simplify troubleshooting and replacement, especially in multi-node or hyperscale installations where hardware tracking matters.\n\nHighPoint did not disclose pricing of its Rocket 7638D switch card, which will probably depend on volumes and other factors.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

      "content": "Changing jobs is common, but quitting in nine days? That’s what a Reddit user admitted in a post that has now captured widespread attention online.\n\nAfter spending four months unemployed and facing countless rejections, the man finally landed a DevOps position at a small startup with around 80 employees. Initially, he felt relieved, thinking he had finally secured some stability. But shortly after, an offer from a UK-based multinational bank arrived, presenting a Software Engineer role with a slightly higher salary of 15 LPA, a hybrid work model in Bengaluru, and, most importantly, a healthier work-life balance.\n\nHe didn’t take the decision lightly. Friends and mentors from companies like Nvidia, Amazon, Zeta, and Nutanix encouraged him to take the MNC offer, highlighting its long-term benefits.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“Honestly, I’m kinda overwhelmed. It feels weird to put down papers after just 9 days of joining, but I know how much I struggled when I was jobless, and I don’t want to miss this shot. Also, my HR here had lowballed me below my last CTC (took me to 8 LPA, which I negotiated to 14 LPA), so that always stayed in my head,” he wrote.\n\nHe added, “Let’s see, bhai, hopefully this time it’s long-term and I can settle without this constant job switch stress. I have stopped applying, honestly, I am tired of interviewing and studying after I have appeared for 30 interviews at least. So I needed peace, I feel this will be it, I wanna stay here for a minimum of 1.5 – 2 years.”\n\nTake a look at the post:\n\nScreenshot of the Reddit post Screenshot of the Reddit post\n\nHis bold move has sparked a wider conversation about workplace culture, the importance of work-life balance, and what stability really means in today’s fast-moving job market.\n\nA user wrote, “An MNC is relatively the more stable job. And also the brand recognition helps, so don’t worry too much, you did the right thing.” Another user wrote, “Companies will throw you out after 1 day of hiring if all of a sudden you are not an asset to him. Don’t think twice , just put down your paper again.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nA third person commented, “Don’t think much. Just make the switch. My past 3 companies were mid to small startups, and all of them had terrible culture, weekend work,g and then finally I left one, and the next 2 closed down without even paying salaries. The thing is, MNCs bring stability, long-term career plan,and better opportunities in the next switch.”\n\nA fourth individual wrote, “But what about notice period?did u got early release or need to serve whole duration because since u had already given bank interview u must have told them I can join on this date rigth?

      "content": "Chinese tech stocks extended their rally Thursday, fueled by persistent investor enthusiasm for the country’s artificial intelligence developers.\n\nThe Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 0.9%, led by gains in JD.com Inc., the e-commerce giant with ambitious AI plans, and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. The index, which tracks Chinese technology companies listed in Hong Kong, is now set for its eighth consecutive weekly advance, the longest winning streak since its inception.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChinese technology companies have been on a strong upward trajectory, driven by grassroots AI advancements that gained global attention following surprising breakthroughs by startup DeepSeek. The elevated stock momentum marks a sharp reversal from just a year ago, when the sector was weighed down by regulatory crackdowns and a slowing economy.\n\nFresh impetus came from the government’s announcement for increased support for the sector, alongside Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s plans to ramp up AI spending and its new partnership with Nvidia Corp. These developments helped push the benchmark’s year-to-date gain to about 44%.\n\n“AI optimism is surely one factor with Alibaba’s confidence in raising capital expenditure yesterday driving positive sentiment across the tech space,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. Concerns about value-destructive competition in food delivery and quick commerce appear to be easing, given heightened government scrutiny, he added.\n\nJD.com shares rose 3.5%, buoyed by reports that the company disclosed at a conference in Beijing that it plans to continue investing over the next three years to build a trillion-yuan AI ecosystem.\n\nXiaomi shares gained over 4% ahead of the company’s release of its latest flagship smartphone, the Xiaomi 17, that will compete directly with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 17. Baidu Inc. shares climbed over 2%, boosted by an announcement that its autonomous driving unit was granted driving trial permit in Dubai.\n\nThe rally has also pushed the Hang Seng Tech Index to technically overbought territory, based on its 14-day relative strength index, Bloomberg-compiled data showed. In terms of valuation, the index now trades at 21.5 times forward earnings estimates, above its three-year average of 18.",

The company behind ChatGPT struck an initial cloud deal with CoreWeave in March worth up to $11.9 billion, followed by a $4 billion add‑on in May.\n\nThe latest addition shows the deepening relationship between the two companies as OpenAI seeks multiple partners to help with an unprecedented data-center buildout to meet its growing computational demands.\n\nThe announcement follows major updates to OpenAI’s infrastructure project \"Stargate\". OpenAI said Tuesday it will open three new sites with Oracle, its cloud partner with a $300 billion deal over the next few years, and build two additional data centers with SoftBank.\n\nCoreWeave shares rose as much as 6% in early trading before paring gains to trade flat. Reuters was first to report the news.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, CEO Michael Intrator reiterated the continued AI infrastructure demand he is seeing from clients.\n\n“The market is incredibly behind on its ability to deliver the infrastructure that's being demanded. As an industry, we continue to underestimate the demand for things,” Intrator said.\n\nHe also described the expanded contract with OpenAI as a sign that CoreWeave is diversifying its revenue away from Microsoft, which was once OpenAI's exclusive infrastructure provider and accounted for 60% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024.\n\n“The opportunity to go about diversifying our clients with some really wonderful, well-known, creditworthy customers is very exciting. When I think about this quarter, this is the quarter of diversification for us,\" he added.\n\nOpenAI has said Stargate aims to secure a total of 10 gigawatts of capacity through an investment that could reach $500 billion.\n\n\"The combined capacity from these five new sites—along with our flagship site in Abilene, Texas, and ongoing projects with CoreWeave—brings Stargate to nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment over the next three years,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.\n\nThe wave of agreements underscores the convergence of interests among major tech companies developing advanced AI and raises questions about \"circular\" financing across the industry and whether capital will continue to flow.",

      "headline": "Could Intel's latest moves signal a new chapter in its relationship with Apple?",
      "content": "Apple and Intel’s relationship has shifted from partnership to split, and now, to possible reconciliation.\n\nApple and Intel were once closely tied. Intel powered Apple’s line of Mac devices, and for years, the partnership looked solid.\n\nTheir history actually dates back to the 1990s with the secret Star Trek project, an early attempt to get Mac OS running on Intel processors. That effort never launched, but the two companies finally came together in 2005 when Steve Jobs announced at WWDC that Apple would transition from PowerPC to Intel chips. At the time, Intel’s processor roadmap looked far stronger, marking a major shift in Apple’s computing strategy.\n\nNow, years after their split, Intel appears to be seeking Apple’s help once again.\n\nIntel Meteor Lake (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)\n\nIn 2006, Apple launched its first Intel-based Macs. The iMac and MacBook Pro both shipped with Intel’s Core Duo processors, and by August of that year, Apple had already completed the transition across its entire Mac lineup.\n\nThings looked strong for the partnership, but Apple was already planning ahead. In 2008, it acquired P.A. Semi for $278 million to develop custom ARM-based chips for mobile devices. This move marked the start of Apple’s long-term strategy to reduce its reliance on external chipmakers.\n\nBy 2010, Apple had introduced the A4 processor in the original iPad. It was a single-core chip running at 1GHz, a modest start that would see rapid improvement in the years that followed. By 2015 and 2016, Apple’s A9 series had arrived, and this is where the relationship with Intel began to show strain.\n\nThe relationship strain and the final break\n\nApple had already begun looking elsewhere to meet its LTE demands, turning to Qualcomm for support. By 2018, Intel struggled to keep up with Apple’s performance requirements.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn 2019, Apple acquired the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business for $1 billion. The deal gave Apple control over a key iPhone component, and later that year, Intel sold the rest of its modem business to Apple.\n\nThe real breaking point came in 2020 with the announcement of the M1 chipset. It was Apple’s first ARM-based processor for Macs, and it proved to be a breakthrough. The M1 was so successful that Apple fully discontinued the use of Intel processors in 2021.\n\nInvestments offer hope for Intel’s future\n\nIt’s no secret that Intel has struggled in recent years. Between 2021 and 2024, it lost market share to AMD and missed out on the AI boom dominated by Nvidia. During this period, Intel’s stock declined by more than 30%.\n\nEven Intel’s leadership has been blunt about the situation. CFO David Zinsner admitted the company “fumbled the football” with its Arrow Lake CPUs, and CEO Lip-Bu Tan has warned there are no quick fixes for Intel’s problems.\n\nStill, it’s not all bad news. SoftBank recently invested $2 billion in Intel, while the U.S. government acquired a 9.9% stake worth $8.9 billion. Nvidia has also invested $5 billion, giving it a 4% share in the company.\n\nNow, according to reporting from Bloomberg, Intel has even approached Apple about a potential investment and closer collaboration. Talks are still in early stages, and there’s no guarantee of a deal, but it shows how far Intel is willing to go to secure its future.\n\nFollow Windows Central on Google News to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!",

      "headline": "Nvidia gives OpenAI $100 billion to spend mostly on Nvidia hardware and Nvidia share price goes up by $220 billion - why am I not surprised?",
      "content": "Nvidia commits $100 billion to OpenAI while reinforcing demand for its hardware\n\nPartnership builds massive data centers and fuels concerns over circular investment structures\n\nAnalysts warn deal may raise antitrust scrutiny as Nvidia strengthens AI dominance\n\nFollowing its recent surprise $5 billion Intel deal, Nvidia is spending big again, this time committing up to $100 billion to OpenAI alongside supplying millions of its chips.\n\nThe move fits a broader pattern in which Nvidia channels money into businesses that rely on its own hardware, from $6.3 billion in CoreWeave to $700 million in nScale, effectively reinforcing demand for its products while bypassing hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft which are racing to reduce their dependence on Nvidia’s hardware.\n\nThis latest investment into the world’s best-known AI firm immediately lifted Nvidia’s market value by more than $220 billion.\n\nCircular structure\n\nThe deal involves a circular structure and will see Nvidia will buy non-voting shares in OpenAI, which OpenAI will then spend mostly on Nvidia systems.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, Reuters says the partnership will begin with a $10 billion investment and scale as OpenAI deploys more computing power.\n\n“This is the biggest AI infrastructure project in history,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with CNBC’s Jon Fortt. “This partnership is about building an AI infrastructure that enables AI to go from the labs into the world.”\n\nHe said the companies will build data centers capable of running next-generation AI models, powered by Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin platform.\n\nAre you a pro?

These arrangements can be beneficial for both parties. But there can be dangers as well. Being totally linked with each other can cause for short-sightedness and can make an entry point for other chip competitors to come into other AI companies and woo them,\" she said.\n\nMarketScreener quotes Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust professor at Vanderbilt Law School, who says there are concerns that Nvidia could favor OpenAI with better pricing or faster delivery times.\n\n\"They're financially interested in each other's success,” she said. “That creates an incentive for Nvidia to not sell chips to, or not sell chips on the same terms to, other competitors of OpenAI.\"\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson denied this would be case, saying, \"We will continue to make every customer a top priority, with or without any equity stake.\"\n\nNvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of data center buildout - YouTube Watch On",

      "headline": "Wemade’s 7-Year Blockchain Journey Culminates in Global KRW Stablecoin Push",
      "content": "Wonil Suh, Executive Vice President of Wemade, represents Korea’s blockchain gaming evolution. His company launched its blockchain journey seven years ago with the establishment of WEMIX, becoming one of Korea’s most experienced Web3 enterprises. With over 1,000 employees dedicated to WEMIX-related operations globally, Wemade operates at unprecedented organizational scale in blockchain gaming.\n\nDuring Korea Blockchain Week’s main event, particularly after sessions featuring US participants including Donald Trump Jr., Suh appeared increasingly confident about stablecoin adoption. His conviction stems from Wemade’s practical experience managing millions of gaming transactions and developing comprehensive blockchain infrastructure. The executive envisions Korean Won stablecoins facilitating everything from K-content consumption to tourism payments worldwide.\n\nSponsored\n\nWhy did Wemade launch the stablecoin project, ‘Stable One’, as a gaming company?\n\n“Wemade initiated our blockchain business seven years ago in 2018, establishing us among Korea’s most experienced companies in this domain with our scale and focused commitment. It’s not that we recently started stablecoins because they’re hot or trendy—we’ve maintained this strategic direction consistently. As a gaming company, we recognized that blockchain technology offers substantial utility in gaming applications, and we’ve witnessed numerous successful implementations within our own gaming portfolio.\n\nWe’ve accumulated extensive knowledge through managing hundreds of millions of transactions from over 30 games supporting over 1 million monthly concurrent users. We’ve consistently believed this expertise shouldn’t remain proprietary but should benefit the broader industry. Stablecoins represents a pivotal opportunity in this regard. We didn’t merely study the technology—we developed practical applications with it. From this perspective, we possess significant value to contribute to the ecosystem.”\n\nRather than being a direct issuer, Wemade positions itself as a platform provider for stablecoins. Can you explain your partnership model and how you plan to build this consortium approach?\n\n“Rather than establishing our own proprietary stablecoin, we believe consortium participation would be more advantageous. As a technology partner, we aim to extensively leverage our existing technological capabilities. We will collaborate with various Korean enterprises, and as essentially a tech partner, we can create synergies with those in the banking and financial sectors that possess decades or centuries of institutional expertise in regulatory compliance and licensing frameworks.\n\nWe’re cultivating global partnerships—Chainalysis participated in our recent event, demonstrating our commitment to expanding these international alliances. Our strategy involves launching a testnet, inviting diverse partners to participate, going open-source, and targeting early next year for operational deployment with multiple strategic partners.”\n\nSponsored\n\nUpon announcing the Stable One, Wemade mentioned wanting overseas users to adopt the KRW stablecoin. What specific use cases do you envision – from cultural content consumption to tourism payments?\n\n“Korea is currently at a cultural peak, with extensive global exposure through travel, K-culture fandom, and Korean content consumption worldwide. These digital natives are broadly distributed globally. Instead of using foreign stablecoins for Korean cultural content, having a Korean stablecoin could serve as our foundation.\n\nFor companies and labels with artists and IPs with global fandom, when selling tickets or merchandise online—rather than pricing in dollars or euros—they could facilitate direct KRW transactions and remittances. Foreign tourists visiting Korea currently exchange currency at airports or local money changers, but if they could simply convert to digital KRW stablecoins upon arrival, using familiar payment apps for Korean transactions, this would eliminate traditional currency exchange inconvenience while supporting Korean businesses.”\n\nSponsored\n\nWhat is Wemade’s overarching global strategy, and how does the WEMIX Play platform fit into becoming a major gaming destination worldwide?\n\n“After launching MIR4 four years ago, we realized all content, especially games with user time investment and internal economies, would inevitably require blockchain integration. We determined we needed to create a platform—since this technology will be universally adopted, we should build excellent systems for smaller companies with limited resources to utilize, rather than having every company develop independently.\n\nEssentially, game developers won’t need to create a game launcher or payment system for each game they develop, so they can just focus on content creation and simply be onboarded to the platform. We envision WEMIX Play becoming a global gaming platform where all game companies—from Africa, India, Eastern Europe—would naturally list their games on our platform, alongside Apple, Google, and Steam. Currently featuring dozens of games, our long-term vision encompasses thousands, even hundreds of thousands of titles, all powered by our WEMIX blockchain infrastructure and utility token ecosystem.”\n\nHow do you see AI transforming the gaming industry, and how is Wemade integrating AI with blockchain technology? Can you tell us about your NVIDIA collaboration?\n\n“AI and gaming naturally complement each other, as do crypto and gaming. Across our 20-30 games currently in development through various studios, every single one leverages AI—whether for enhanced art creation or algorithmic development. We partner with NVIDIA rather than building everything in-house. While productivity improvements are obvious benefits, the transformative potential lies in AI fundamentally reshaping gameplay experiences. We integrate game tokenomics during development, weaving blockchain technology organically into the game fabric rather than adding it superficially. AI should similarly enable revolutionary gameplay—AI companions, skill-adaptive experiences, personalized strategic assistance. Combined with crypto and stablecoins, we foresee agentic AI facilitating autonomous agent-to-agent commerce within gaming ecosystems, marking a profound industry paradigm shift.”\n\nSponsored\n\nLooking ahead 5-10 years, how do you expect blockchain technology to reshape both gaming and finance? What role does Wemade want to play in that transformation?\n\n“I envision a future where AI enhances productivity, creating more leisure time and potentially universal basic income scenarios. People will have two experiential paths: expensive real-world experiences for the wealthy, or rich digital experiences for those with abundant time but limited resources.\n\nDigital worlds perfectly serve this latter demographic. Gaming extends beyond traditional gameplay—platforms like Roblox already represent metaverse experiences where commerce operates primarily through crypto. AI agents will facilitate these transactions, with stablecoins enabling seamless payments. When our children mature, this integrated AI-crypto-gaming ecosystem will seem completely natural. Wemade positions itself at the center of this major paradigm transformation.”\n\nGiven some regulatory challenges Wemade has faced in Korea, what message would you send to international investors who might have concerns about the Korean crypto landscape?\n\n“As one of Korea’s largest gaming companies with global reach, our combat strength is formidable. We’ve fought many battles, experienced setbacks, and developed extensive strategies. These challenges strengthen rather than weaken us. With over 1,000 employees dedicated to WEMIX-related work—unprecedented globally—we’ve built unmatched organizational capability. Having weathered these difficulties, we’re now positioned to deliver superior services. Korean companies possess tremendous potential that institutional investors and crypto holders should recognize and support.”",

      "headline": "North Korean Hackers Use New AkdoorTea Backdoor to Target Global Crypto Developers",
      "content": "The North Korea-linked threat actors associated with the Contagious Interview campaign have been attributed to a previously undocumented backdoor called AkdoorTea, along with tools like TsunamiKit and Tropidoor.\n\nSlovak cybersecurity firm ESET, which is tracking the activity under the name DeceptiveDevelopment, said the campaign targets software developers across all operating systems, Windows, Linux, and macOS, particularly those involved in cryptocurrency and Web3 projects. It's also referred to as DEV#POPPER, Famous Chollima, Gwisin Gang, Tenacious Pungsan, UNC5342, and Void Dokkaebi.\n\n\"DeceptiveDevelopment's toolset is mostly multi-platform and consists of initial obfuscated malicious scripts in Python and JavaScript, basic backdoors in Python and Go, and a dark web project in .NET,\" ESET researchers Peter Kálnai and Matěj Havránek said in a report shared with The Hacker News.\n\nThe campaign essentially involves the impersonated recruiters offering what appear to be lucrative job roles over platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, Freelancer, and Crypto Jobs List. After initial outreach, should the prospective target express interest in the opportunity, they are either asked to complete a video assessment by clicking on a link or a coding exercise.\n\nThe programming assignment requires them to clone projects hosted on GitHub, which silently install malware. On the other hand, websites explicitly set up for undertaking the so-called video assessment display non-existent errors related to camera or microphone access being blocked, and urge them to follow ClickFix-style instructions to rectify the problem by either launching the command prompt or the Terminal app, depending on the operating system used.\n\nIrrespective of the method employed, the attacks have been generally found to deliver several pieces of malware such as BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie, GolangGhost (aka FlexibleFerret or WeaselStore), and PylangGhost.\n\n\"WeaselStore's functionality is quite similar to both BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, with the main focus being exfiltration of sensitive data from browsers and cryptocurrency wallets,\" ESET said. \"Once the data has been exfiltrated, WeaselStore, unlike traditional infostealers, continues to communicate with its C&C [command-and-control] server, serving as a RAT capable of executing various commands.\"\n\nAlso deployed as part of these infection sequences are TsunamiKit and Tropidoor, the first of which is a malware toolkit delivered by InvisibleFerret and is designed for information and cryptocurrency theft. The use of TsunamiKit was first discovered in November 2024.\n\nThe toolkit comprises several components, the starting point being the initial stage TsunamiLoader that triggers the execution of an injector (TsunamiInjector), which, in turn, drops TsunamiInstaller and TsunamiHardener.\n\nWhile TsunamiInstaller acts as a dropper for TsunamiClientInstaller, which then downloads and executes TsunamiClient, TsunamiHardener is responsible for setting up persistence for TsunamiClient, as well as configuring Microsoft Defender exclusions. TsunamiClient is the core module that incorporates a .NET spyware and drops cryptocurrency miners like XMRig and NBMiner.\n\nIt's believed that TsunamiKit is likely a modification of a dark web project rather than a native creation of the threat actor, given that samples related to the toolkit have been uncovered dating back to December 2021, predating the onset of Contagious Interview, which is believed to have commenced sometime in late 2022.\n\nThe BeaverTail stealer and downloader has also been found to act as a distribution vehicle for another malware known as Tropidoor that, according to ASEC, overlaps with a Lazarus Group tool called LightlessCan. ESET said it found evidence of Tropidoor artifacts uploaded to VirusTotal from Kenya, Colombia, and Canada, adding the malware also shares \"large portions of code\" with PostNapTea, a malware used by the threat actor against South Korean targets in 2022.\n\nPostNapTea supports commands for configuration updates, file manipulation and screen capturing, file system management, process management, and running custom versions of Windows commands like whoami, netstat, tracert, lookup, ipconfig, and systeminfo, among others, for improved stealth – a feature also present in LightlessCan.\n\n\"Tropidoor is the most sophisticated payload yet linked to the DeceptiveDevelopment group, probably because it is based on malware developed by the more technically advanced threat actors under the Lazarus umbrella,\" ESET said.\n\nExecution chain of WeaselStore\n\nThe latest addition to the threat actor's arsenal is a remote access trojan dubbed AkdoorTea that's delivered by means of a Windows batch script. The script downloads a ZIP file (\"nvidiaRelease.zip\") and executes a Visual Basic Script present in it, which then proceeds to launch BeaverTail and AkdoorTea payloads also contained in the archive.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the campaign has leveraged NVIDIA-themed driver updates in the past as part of ClickFix attacks to address supposed camera or microphone issues when providing the video assessments, indicating that this approach is being used to propagate AkdoorTea.\n\nAkdoorTea gets its name from the fact that it shares commonalities with Akdoor, which is described as a variant of the NukeSped (aka Manuscrypt) implant – further reinforcing Contagious Interview's connections to the larger Lazarus Group umbrella.\n\n\"DeceptiveDevelopment's TTPs illustrate a more distributed, volume-driven model of its operations. Despite often lacking technical sophistication, the group compensates through scale and creative social engineering,\" ESET said.\n\n\"Its campaigns demonstrate a pragmatic approach, exploiting open-source tooling, reusing available dark web projects, adapting malware probably rented from other North Korea-aligned groups, and leveraging human vulnerabilities through fake job offers and interview platforms.\"\n\nContagious Interview doesn't operate in silo, as it has been also found to share some level of overlaps with Pyongyang's fraudulent IT worker scheme (aka WageMole), with Zscaler noting that the intelligence gleaned from the former is used by North Korean actors to secure jobs at those companies using stolen identities and fabricating synthetic personas. The IT worker threat is believed to have been ongoing since 2017.\n\nConnection between Contagious Interview and WageMole\n\nCybersecurity company Trellix, in a report published this week, said it uncovered an instance of a North Korean IT worker employment fraud targeting a U.S. healthcare company, where an individual using the name \"Kyle Lankford\" applied for a Principal Software Engineer position.\n\nWhile the job applicant did not raise any red flags during the early stages of the hiring process, Trellix said it was able to correlate their email addresses with known North Korea IT worker indicators. Further analysis of the email exchanges and background checks identified the candidate as a likely North Korean operative, it added.\n\n\"The activities of North Korean IT workers constitute a hybrid threat,\" ESET noted. \"This fraud-for-hire scheme combines classical criminal operations, such as identity theft and synthetic identity fraud, with digital tools, which classify it as both a traditional crime and a cybercrime (or e-crime).\"",

Maybe the most surprising thing about YouTube is how a service can be so dominant, and yet fly so completely under the radar. That has a lot of implications, including on my analysis: in The YouTube Tip of the Google Spear I look at the history of user-generated content to explain why video tends to be a bigger business than text, which means that YouTube, powered by Google DeepMind, has the potential to win in consumer AI. Google, though, has been about potential, not products; that’s why some of the new features at last week’s Youtube event were such a big deal. — Ben Thompson\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Does an Nvidia-Intel Partnership Mean? Once upon a time Nvidia saw Intel as an existential threat, but that was almost thirty years ago. Today, as Intel confronts its own spectrum of existential threats, Nvidia is following the U.S. government’s lead and throwing the company a $5 billion life preserver; Monday’s Daily Update took a closer look at the details of the partnership. In short, the deal will help Intel’s cash flow and long-term credibility with potential chip customers, both of which Intel desperately needs, but to be clear, Nvidia is not going to be fabbing any of its chips at Intel foundries, which America desperately needs to succeed. Instead, Nvidia found a way to position itself as an Intel savior with a design deal that assumes none of the risk of actually fabbing chips at Intel, uses Intel’s customer base to increase Nvidia’s access to the enterprise market, makes them an even more formidable foil to AMD, and likely dissuades Intel from competing in the GPU space. President Trump called Jensen Huang “a smart cookie” earlier this year, and this deal supports the claim. — Andrew Sharp\n\n\n\nLet’s Talk About Sushi Robots. For anyone who needs something completely different, I’m here to endorse 20 minutes on the history of industrialized nigiri production. The latest from Jon at Asianometry focuses on the rise of sushi robotics in 1980s Japan, but also traces the origins of sushi and the art of forming the shari-dama (“rice jewel”), which took chefs 4 to 5 years to master, after which chefs could make 300-350 rice pieces per hour. That is, until the robots arrived: In the 1970s a company called Suzumo began filming chef hand movements and attempting mechanical replication, and by the ’80s they had succeeded. Today, what was dubbed a “sushi robot” can make up to 1,200 rice bases per hour, allowing sushi chefs to reallocate their energy to plating and fish preparation, reducing the cost of production overall, and allowing sushi businesses to scale all over the world. If you’re interested, Jon’s video is also available to Stratechery subscribers as a podcast, which you can download here, right before you start making plans to find some sushi this weekend. — AS\n\nStratechery Articles and Updates\n\nDithering with Ben Thompson and Daring Fireball’s John Gruber\n\nAsianometry with Jon Yu\n\nSharp China with Andrew Sharp and Sinocism’s Bill Bishop\n\nGreatest of All Talk with Andrew Sharp and WaPo’s Ben Golliver\n\nSharp Tech with Andrew Sharp and Ben Thompson\n\nThis week’s Sharp Tech video is on whether Apple is changing the world.",

      "headline": "AI Investment Is Starting to Look Like a Slush Fund",
      "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nNo two companies are as important to the recent AI boom as OpenAI and Nvidia. OpenAI’s journey from research lab to chatbot juggernaut reoriented the entire tech industry around the thesis that large-language models will change everything. Nvidia’s chips have been almost synonymous with scaling, on which OpenAI and others are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars. For the last few years, the companies’ fortunes have been aligned, and their relationship has been, for the most part, an obvious one: OpenAI, which has become one of the biggest start-ups in the world, is a major customer for Nvidia, which has become the largest public company in the world.\n\nIn 2025, their twin trajectories have left much of the rest of the economy behind, and their stated ambitions — necessary to keep the momentum going — have become extreme. In a recent blog post, Sam Altman said his company wanted to “create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week” to “maybe” be able to “figure out how to cure cancer” or “provide customized tutoring to every student on Earth.” OpenAI hasn’t had any trouble raising money so far, but when your investment projections start crossing into the trillions, financing starts to get tricky, particularly if you aren’t a company like Google or Meta, with an existing business throwing off tens of billions of dollars a year. Which might help explain this:\n\nOpenAI and NVIDIA today announced a letter of intent for a landmark strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure to train and run its next generation of models on the path to deploying superintelligence. To support this deployment including data center and power capacity, NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmphasis mine! The issue of circular financing in the AI world has been bubbling up for a while. As the Information reported in May, Nvidia has been engineering disorienting deals with customers for a while, most obviously with a company called Coreweave, which rents compute — basically, access to Nvidia hardware — to AI firms:\n\nThe chip giant invested $100 million in [Coreweave] in early 2023. It funneled hundreds of thousands of high-end graphics processing units to CoreWeave. And it agreed to rent back its chips from CoreWeave through August 2027.\n\nIn related news, just this week, Coreweave announced it had “expanded its partnership with OpenAI in a new deal worth up to $6.5 billion, bringing the total value of their agreements to $22.4 billion.” These announcements aren’t exactly attempts to obfuscate what’s going on here — “NVIDIA intends to invest … as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed” — but it’s worth stating even more plainly what’s happening here: Nvidia is investing money in one of its largest customers, which will use some of that money to buy or lease capacity from Nvidia. On Tuesday, we got a little more insight into how that would actually happen. OpenAI, Oracle (a cloud provider that depends on Nvidia), and Softbank (a major investor in Nvidia and OpenAI) fleshed out plans to build out more data centers, which would one day be full of Nvidia hardware paid for or leased by … OpenAI.\n\nIf you’re a layperson, this probably sounds a bit weird. Maybe our friends in finance can explain a hidden logic here? Rich Privorotsky of Goldman Sachs attempts to summarize the arrangement: “Nvidia invests up to $100bn for non-voting shares, and OpenAI uses the cash to buy Nvidia chips, with a plan to deploy what could be at least 10GW of Nvidia systems.” It is what it looks like, in other words: a small group of large companies handing money back and forth.\n\nWith a number of caveats — every cycle is different, and the earnings multiples aren’t as crazy yet — he also draws a parallel to the late 90s, which have been coming up a lot lately. “Vendor financing was a feature of that era, when the telecom equipment makers (Cisco, Lucent, Nortel, etc.) extended loans, equity investments, or credit guarantees to their customers who then used the cash/credit to buy back the equipment,” he writes. Indeed, vendor financing features prominently in tech-bubble postmortems. In 2002, Newsweek explained the strange role they played at the tail end of the ’90s tech-investment boom:\n\nSwept up in the free-money spirit of the time, they were financing not only the customers’ purchase of their wares — the switches, routers and other nuts and bolts of the Internet — but the growth of the customers’ businesses, too. The standard practice of vendor financing thus became another wretched bubble excess: as if Ford were loaning customers money to buy cars — and boats, jewels and houses, too. “Vendor financing was the sickest sign of how things spun out of control,” says Tero Kuittinen, technology adviser to Finnish investment bank Opstock in Helsinki.\n\n\n\nThe parallels are obvious — or, at least, would look extremely obvious if the AI industry’s fortunes turned — but they’re not determinative. During the telecom buildout, vendor financing surged at a particular time. “Vendor-financing deals account for a relatively small fraction of the total $1 trillion in debt held by telecom carriers worldwide,” Newsweek noted at the time, but investment continued well after the early 2000 market collapse “wiped out the silliest ideas for pet, toy and trinket Web sites,” on the thesis that “dot-coms might be dead, but the Internet itself would thrive,” a perfectly reasonable argument if timing doesn’t matter, which of course it does, quite a bit. Last month, Kuittinen argued that this time, things really are different, but not necessarily in a good way:\n\nThe fascinating thing about AI bubble popping is that it’s not gonna play out like Lucent in 2001. Because this crew does not believe in free markets. They’re gonna try to prop up this thing like Soviet television industry in 1980’s. Tax payer money is gonna FLOW. — Tero Kuittinen (@teroterotero) August 21, 2025\n\nThe constellation of companies raising, spending, and sharing money on the broad technological and ideological project that is artificial intelligence in the 2020s is betting that, given enough resources, they can build the most profitable and powerful companies of all time, and that early concerns over profitability and circular financing will, in hindsight, seem blinkered and silly. (Or, according to Peter Thiel, like complicity in the summoning of the Antichrist.) In the process of trying, the industry is willing to drift into a strange and potentially risky arrangement — although some of the implied risk might be mitigated, as Alphaville mockingly points out, by vagueness and lack of binding obligations — which, in any case, given the potential upside, investors still seem comfortable with for now: a hypercapitalized financial polycule in which everyone is everyone’s investor, partner, vendor, and customer.",

      "content": "Un nuovo scenario si apre per la creazione di animazioni facciali 3D: da oggi, la generazione automatica di espressioni realistiche a partire dall’audio non è più appannaggio esclusivo dei grandi studi.\n\nCon il rilascio in open source della tecnologia Audio2Face, NVIDIA compie un passo decisivo verso la democratizzazione di strumenti avanzati, mettendo a disposizione di sviluppatori, artisti e ricercatori un sistema capace di tradurre la voce in movimenti facciali dettagliati e credibili con un semplice clic.\n\nLa vera forza di Audio2Face risiede nella sua capacità di analizzare le sfumature della voce – dai fonemi all’intonazione – per generare dati di animazione facciale immediatamente applicabili a qualsiasi modello 3D. Non si tratta solo di una tecnologia all’avanguardia, ma di un intero ecosistema: il pacchetto rilasciato comprende uno SDK completo, plugin specifici per Autodesk Maya e Unreal Engine 5, oltre a un framework dedicato all’addestramento di modelli personalizzati. Questi strumenti permettono di integrare facilmente la soluzione nei flussi di lavoro già consolidati nei settori della produzione digitale, dell’intrattenimento e della ricerca.\n\nNVIDIA Audio2Face è un salto di qualità notevole nell’animazione 3D\n\nUno degli elementi più apprezzati della distribuzione open source è la presenza di modelli pre-addestrati. Questi spaziano da reti di regressione, fondamentali per una sincronizzazione precisa delle labbra (lip sync), fino ai più sofisticati modelli diffusion che assicurano un realismo senza precedenti nei movimenti del volto. A completare il quadro, la suite include anche sistemi Audio2Emotion, progettati per dedurre le emozioni trasmesse dal parlato e tradurle in espressioni facciali autentiche. Tali asset consentono anche a team con risorse limitate di personalizzare le animazioni, adattandole a lingue diverse o a stili vocali peculiari, senza la necessità di partire da zero.\n\nL’apertura di NVIDIA segna una svolta epocale, offrendo a sviluppatori indipendenti, piccole aziende e laboratori universitari la possibilità di accedere a strumenti di alto livello fino a ieri riservati ai grandi player del settore. Il vantaggio è duplice: da un lato, si riducono sensibilmente i costi e i tempi legati all’animazione manuale; dall’altro, si favorisce l’innovazione grazie alla possibilità di sperimentare e ottimizzare i modelli secondo le esigenze specifiche di ciascun progetto.\n\nLa validità della soluzione è già comprovata da casi d’uso concreti nel mondo videoludico. Ad esempio, The Farm 51 ha adottato Audio2Face per la realizzazione delle animazioni facciali in Chernobylite 2, mentre Survios lo ha integrato nel titolo Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition, ottenendo un notevole risparmio nei processi di animazione manuale e un incremento della qualità espressiva dei personaggi digitali.\n\nDal punto di vista tecnico, la tecnologia offre una versatilità senza pari: supporta sia il rendering offline per la produzione di contenuti pre-renderizzati, sia l’elaborazione in tempo reale per personaggi interattivi. Questo la rende ideale non solo per videogiochi e film, ma anche per applicazioni social e ambienti metaverso, dove la credibilità delle espressioni facciali rappresenta un elemento cruciale per l’esperienza utente.\n\nNon mancano, tuttavia, interrogativi di natura etica. L’accessibilità della tecnologia apre infatti la porta a potenziali abusi, come la creazione di deepfake o la riproduzione non autorizzata di identità vocali. La comunità di sviluppatori, coordinata tramite un canale Discord dedicato, sta già lavorando all’elaborazione di linee guida e strumenti per il tracciamento dell’origine dei contenuti, al fine di promuovere un utilizzo responsabile e trasparente.",

      "headline": "20VC + SaaStr is Back!! NVIDIA’s $100B OpenAI Investment, H-1B’s $100K Fee Impact on Startups, and Is “Triple Triple Double Double” Really Dead?",
      "content": "20VC + SaaStr is Back!! NVIDIA’s $100B OpenAI Investment, H-1B’s $100K Fee Impact on Startups, and Is “Triple Triple Double Double” Really Dead?\n\nHarry, Rory and Jason are back!\n\nWe’re witnessing an unprecedented capital concentration in AI with NVIDIA’s $100B OpenAI investment creating a fascinating circular money machine, while new H-1B visa fees threaten startup talent acquisition and the venture funding landscape shifts dramatically toward mega-rounds for a tiny number of companies. The era of “founder friendly” has become somewhat hollow rhetoric, and traditional B2B growth metrics like “triple triple double double” are becoming irrelevant as the market polarizes between AI unicorns and fundamentals-driven businesses.\n\nKey Numbers That Matter:\n\n75% of 2025 VC dollars went to just 19 companies\n\nNVIDIA’s $4.5T market cap relies on only 6 customers for 83% of revenue\n\nNew H-1B visa fees of $100K will impact 440,000 annual applications\n\nNavan filing for IPO at $8B valuation with $613M revenue, 32% growth\n\nThe $100B AI Money Machine: When Six Customers Drive a $4.5T Market Cap\n\nNVIDIA’s massive investment in OpenAI represents more than just capital deployment—it’s the creation of what could be an infinite money printing loop. OpenAI commits $300B to Oracle, Oracle buys NVIDIA chips, and NVIDIA invests back into OpenAI. As one observer noted: “Sam’s gonna get to make the bet he wants to make which is apply infinite amount of capital and see how long these scaling laws last.”\n\nThe most striking aspect? NVIDIA, now the world’s largest company by market cap at $4.5 trillion, has only six meaningful customers accounting for 83% of revenue. Compare this to Apple’s 2 billion customers or Microsoft’s hundreds of thousands of enterprise clients. It’s “this really weird dynamic where you’ve got this company with only six customers, but the good news is all six of them are determined to spend themselves into oblivion to win the prize.”\n\nThe Scaling Laws Gamble\n\nSam Altman’s recent comments suggest this is just the beginning: “We need three orders of magnitude more compute than this.” The market is essentially allowing OpenAI to test whether massive capital can break through current AI limitations. Whether the marginal $300 billion will earn a return on capital remains questionable, but as Rory put it: “We will find out because no one’s going to call timeout along the way.”\n\nThe H-1B Shock: $100K Fee Creates New Startup Reality\n\nThe new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas represents a significant shift for the startup ecosystem. With 440,000 applications generating $19-120 billion in GDP annually, this policy change will have material impact on early-stage companies.\n\n“Anyone that has been doing this for a while that isn’t just three kids working 24/7 in SF has had H-1B folks on their team,” noted one investor. “My first startup wouldn’t have been possible without H-1B—at least on its surface—I had two on my first team of 10.” notes Jason.\n\nWhile larger tech companies will simply absorb the cost, startups face a more complex reality. The workaround? Most founders are now pursuing O-1 visas, though these come with their own complications and ongoing maintenance requirements.\n\nVenture Capital’s Great Concentration: 75% of Dollars to 19 Companies\n\nThe venture landscape has fundamentally shifted. In 2025, 75% of VC dollars went to just 19 companies—a stunning concentration that reflects the bifurcation between traditional venture and ultra-late-stage private public investing.\n\n“What’s really happened is on top of that business has emerged this totally separate business called ultra late stage,” explains Harry. “It just means there’s another business that you can choose to be in or not that exists one or two orders of magnitude above you in the valuation world.”\n\nThe Death of “Triple Triple Double Double”\n\nTraditional SaaS growth metrics are becoming obsolete for many companies. While “triple triple double double” (3x-3x-2x-2x growth pattern) remains relevant at early stages, it’s insufficient for late-stage rounds in today’s market.\n\n“There’s only so many folks growing beyond triple triple double double at 50 to 100 million—VCs will take the meeting,” notes Jason. But for companies in traditionally unloved verticals or without AI narratives, even strong growth isn’t guaranteeing funding notes Harry.\n\nThe Founder Friendly Facade\n\nThe concept of “founder friendly” has become meaningless in today’s hyper-competitive environment. “Founder friendly has become bullshit,” argue both Harry and Jason. “Any hot AI deal, there is no diligence provided, nor is any done. It’s just done on Saturday.”\n\nReal founder-friendly behavior shows up in difficult times: “Founder friendly is writing the check when no one else does. That’s founder friendly. Founder friendly is when no one else is there at the board meeting anymore and you’re there and you still have a W on the other side of it.”\n\nMarket Concentration Creates New Dynamics\n\nThe concentration extends beyond just funding to data labeling and infrastructure. Multiple data labeling companies report that the same two AI giants make up 55% of their revenue across all providers. This concentration creates a unique dynamic where “none of those six customers is trying to optimize their cost basis. They’re just trying to build as fast as they can.”\n\nIPO Strategy in a Concentrated World\n\nCompanies like Navan (filing at $8B with $613M revenue, 32% growth) are timing their IPOs strategically. Rather than waiting for profitability, they’re moving quickly to avoid being the “third player” in their category after competitors like Brex and Ramp potentially go public.\n\n“When people perceive it as a direct comp, even if it isn’t, it becomes troubling to get out because every public investor says, ‘I already have Brex and Ramp. Why would I buy you?'” notes Rory.\n\nThe New Venture Reality Check\n\nFor investors, the current environment requires recalibrating expectations. Jason admits: “I’m 0% cash, just like 2008. I remember feeling I could literally not have enough cash to fix the roof on my house—nothing was more fun than selling my stock at a 70% loss to fix that roof.”\n\nThe frothiness is evident: LPs are now bragging about returns on LinkedIn, historically a sign of market peaks. Yet for companies with genuine traction, funding remains available. The key is having clarity on realistic next-round pricing rather than extrapolating long-term returns.\n\nPortfolio Concentration Lessons\n\nSuccess breeds more risk tolerance. “Having an early success is highly correlated with future success. Partly you get the referral effect, but partly I think it’s that you just have the stomach to roll the dice and you get braver.” notes Rory.\n\nThis explains why firms like Sequoia can hold positions like Klarna while emerging managers face different portfolio pressures around concentration limits.\n\nLooking Ahead: The End of 2021 Valuations\n\nThere’s growing consensus that 2021 valuations should be written off entirely. “I think we can’t talk about 2021 valuations anymore. It’s time to just flush them down the toilet,” suggests Jason proposing a deadline: “You’ve got 90 days left to caveat and complain about your 2021 valuations. And on January 1, 2026, no one is allowed to talk about their 2021 valuations.”\n\nCompanies like Notion, now at $500M ARR with re–\\acceleration, show that B2B companies can recover by embracing AI while maintaining their core business. The path forward isn’t becoming “something totally different” but rather intelligent integration of AI capabilities.\n\nThe Monopoly Question\n\nOpenAI’s consumer dominance raises antitrust questions, but it’s complicated by their massive subsidization of users. “Never have there been a less successful monopoly than ChatGPT because they’re subsidizing the consumer surplus delivered by ChatGPT in the tens of billions of dollars” notes Rory.\n\nThe real monopoly question may be more relevant to NVIDIA, which has true market share dominance in AI chips, making their equity investment in OpenAI particularly strategic.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCapital concentration is unprecedented : 75% of 2025 VC dollars went to just 19 companies, creating a new tier of ultra-late-stage private investing distinct from traditional venture\n\n75% of 2025 VC dollars went to just 19 companies, creating a new tier of ultra-late-stage private investing distinct from traditional venture H-1B changes will impact startups materially : The $100K fee creates real barriers for early-stage companies, though workarounds and for founders use of O-1 visas are and will emerge\n\nThe $100K fee creates real barriers for early-stage companies, though workarounds and for founders use of O-1 visas are and will emerge “Founder friendly” has become meaningless : In hot AI deals, there’s no diligence and term sheets are signed on Saturdays, making the concept hollow\n\nIn hot AI deals, there’s no diligence and term sheets are signed on Saturdays, making the concept hollow Traditional SaaS metrics are obsolete: “Triple triple double double” no longer guarantees late-stage funding except for the hottest AI companies\n\n“Triple triple double double” no longer guarantees late-stage funding except for the hottest AI companies Timing matters for IPOs : Companies are racing to go public before competitors in their category, as being third creates comparison problems\n\nCompanies are racing to go public before competitors in their category, as being third creates comparison problems 2021 valuations need to be forgotten : It’s time to write down frothy valuations and move forward with fundamental-based pricing\n\nQuotable Moments\n\n“This is an epic monopoly like we’ve never seen. Think how much ChatGPT already dominates our lives. It’s the Standard Oil of tech.” — Jason discussing OpenAI’s market dominance\n\n“You’ve got this company with $4.5 trillion market cap with only six customers. That’s bad news. But the good news is all six of them are determined to spend themselves into oblivion to win the prize.” — Rory discussing NVIDIA’s customer concentration risk\n\n“Any hot AI deal, there is almost no diligence provided, nor is any done. It’s just done on Saturday. All you can lose is one extra money.” — Jason Lemkin on current venture funding practices\n\n“Having an early success is highly correlated with future success. Partly you get the referral effect, but partly I think it’s that you just have the stomach to roll the dice and you get braver.” — Rory on venture capital success patterns\n\n“I’m 0% cash, just like 2008. Nothing was more fun than selling my stock at a 70% loss to fix the roof on my house.” — Jason reflecting on his current market position\n\n“I’m seeing less diligence now than I did in 2021.” — Harry discussing the current state of venture due diligence\n\n“The hardest thing I find is honestly we are getting it wrong. A lot of our startups at 20VC Fund now are are growing nicely and I cannot predict what the next round wants because it seems to be moving so much and I’m having real problem predicting financing markets.” — Harry on the unpredictability of current funding markets",

      "headline": "The Weirdest Bubble Ever",
      "content": "A couple of weeks ago, it was announced that OpenAI is going to invest up to $300 billion in Oracle’s cloud computing.\n\nThis week, Nvidia committed $100 billion of investments into OpenAI.\n\nOracle is spending billions of dollars on Nvidia’s GPUs.\n\nNvidia invests in OpenAI who then invests in Oracle who then invests in Nvidia and Finkle is Einhorn and Einhorn is Finkle.\n\nWe’ve reached the mutually assured destruction phase of the AI bubble where the tech giants have decided they’re all in this together. If one is going to take the risk on massive capital expenditures then they’re all going to take the risk.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m ready to call this a bubble based purely on the history of excess investments in innovation.\n\nDuring the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, the telecom companies laid down more than 80 million miles of fiber-optic cables. Five years after the bubble burst, 85% of these fiber-optic cables still remained unused.\n\nThe Nasdaq crashed more than 80%.\n\nThe Railway Bubble of the 1800s also comes to mind. Here are some facts and figures I found while researching Don’t Fall For It:\n\nThere were 500 new railway companies by 1845\n\nThat same year, the Board of Trade was considering some 8,000 miles of new track in Great Britain alone, almost 20x the length of England.\n\nThe cost of the buildout was more than the national income of the entire country.\n\nThere were 14 bi-weekly newsletters about the railroad industry in circulation.\n\nCharles Darwin got caught up in the bubble, losing 60% of his investment.\n\nThe good news is both of those bubbles were great for innovation.\n\nBy 1855, there were over 8,000 miles of railroad track in operation, giving Britain the highest density of railroad tracks in the world, measuring seven times the length of France or Germany. The telecomm bubble helped power YouTube, social media, streaming movies, video calls, and everything else people dreamed about in the 1990s and more.\n\nThere are some similarities to the current AI buildout but many differences too.\n\nThe dot-com bubble was fueled by investor speculation in immature companies that didn’t generate any profits. Today’s tech firms are printing cash flow with insanely high margins.\n\nNearly all the money for the railways came from individuals. Retail investors were fueling the bubble.\n\nThe AI boom is coming from inside the house. It’s being led by the tech CEOs who are making these capital allocation decisions.\n\nIn the 1990s, Bill Gates said:\n\nGold rushes tend to encourage impetuous investments. A few will pay off, but when the frenzy is behind us, we will look back incredulously at the wreckage of failed ventures and wonder, ‘Who funded those companies? What was going on in their minds? Was that just a mania at work?’\n\nHere’s what Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview recently:\n\nIf we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate obviously. But what I’d say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side. If you if you build too slowly and then super intelligence is possible in three years, but you built it out assuming it would be there in five years, then you’re just out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology that enables the most new products and innovation and value creation and history.\n\nIn other words — we’re not going to undershoot on this. If it turns into a mania, so be it.\n\nThese tech leaders aren’t stupid. They know the history of over-investment. But they’re saying the risk comes from not spending enough.\n\nSo case closed? This is a bubble that’s sure to pop?\n\nIf this truly is a bubble of epic proportions it’s one of the weirdest ones we’ve ever seen.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, there is now $7.7 trillion sitting in money market funds:\n\nIt’s a bull market in cash holdings.\n\nGold is up more than 40% this year alone and hitting new all-time highs at a healthy clip. Since ChatGPT was released in November 2022, gold is actually outperforming the Nasdaq 100:\n\nHow could a relic that’s been used for thousands of years outperform the biggest, baddest technology companies we’ve ever seen during an orgy of AI spending?\n\nThe other part that makes the current situation tricky to understand is the companies leading the charge in the AI bubble have the fundamentals to back it up. JP Morgan’s Michael Cembalest shared the following in a new research piece this week:\n\nAI related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.\n\nThese companies are spending like drunken sailors but they can all afford the booze!\n\nI understand why many investors are worried about the prospects of a bubble. When they burst it tends to be painful. If you’re invested in the market, you have plenty of exposure to the gigantic tech stocks:\n\nJust because this feels like some of history’s biggest bubbles doesn’t make it any easier to handicap.\n\nThe thing that worries me the most right now is everyone who has ever studied market history is now calling this a bubble. It seems so obvious. Markets are rarely that easy.\n\nSo what if you’re convinced we’re in a bubble? What actions should you take?\n\nI’ll share some thoughts on this topic next week.\n\nIn the meantime, Michael and I talked dissected the AI bubble from all angles and much more on this week’s Animal Spirits:\n\n﻿\n\nSubscribe to The Compound so you never miss an episode.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nIs This 1996 or 1999?\n\nNow here’s what I’ve been reading lately:\n\nBooks:",

(NYSEAmerican:DNN), for its part, stands to benefit from the expected stronger demand for power, as its uranium products are crucial in fueling nuclear power plants for AI companies such as data centers that require a massive amount of electricity.\n\nTo support its expansion plans, the company last month successfully raised $345 million in fresh funds from the issuance of convertible notes due 2031.\n\nProceeds from the offer will be used for the development of its flagship Phoenix In-Situ Recovery uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, while the balance will be used for future investment decisions.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of DNN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

(NASDAQ:INTC) touched its highest 52-week price of $34.25 before a slight profit-taking to end the day just up by 8.87 percent at $33.99 apiece.\n\nIntel Corp. (INTC) Rockets to All-Time High as Firm Lures Apple to Invest\n\nAccording to the company, it persuaded Apple Inc. to invest as part of its efforts to bolster its business.\n\nEarly talks are now ongoing on how to work more closely together. However, negotiations can still fall through.\n\nEarlier this month, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) secured a $5 billion investment from chip giant Nvidia Corp.\n\nThe partnership would also cover the joint development of AI infrastructures and personal computing products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets.\n\nAdditionally, Intel Corp.

Cramer discussed the stock in the September 9 episode and said:\n\n“Sometimes, though, you have a winner right in front of your face and you don’t realize it. When I was at NVIDIA’s big GTC conference… I was checking out the booth of all those companies that were working with Nvidia installing product into the data centers… At the end of the hall in what seemed to me to be a pretty empty booth… this company, Nebius, is a data center builder like CoreWeave. I felt bad for them, like no one was paying any attention to them, so I asked what they did. I sauntered it over there. They filled me in. They were going to be a part of the power solution. I thanked them. Never really thought about it again until yesterday when the company won a $17 billion contract to build a data center for Microsoft in Vineland, New Jersey… Sure enough, Nebius, which had been creeping up, vaulted from $64 to nearly $96 today in a colossal move. Nebius, it turns out, used to be a part of Yandex, a controversial Russian story. Spun out from Yandex, Nebius is controversial no more. It’s just electric, literally.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NBIS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "headline": "Inside the Snapdragon X2 Elite: 20 Questions for Qualcomm’s Computing Chief",
      "content": "Table of Contents Market Successes for Snapdragon X So Far About Snapdragon Guardian Some SoC Particulars Market Positioning for the New X2 Chips Battery Life, and Why a Bigger NPU? Snapdragon X, Looking to 2029...\n\nDon't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google.\n\nLAHAINA, MAUI—The highlight of this year's Snapdragon Summit is the unveiling of Qualcomm's second-generation Snapdragon X2 Arm laptop processors, including a new \"Extreme\" tier of chips that looks poised to take on AMD's, Intel's, and Apple's best. PCs with the new X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme processors won't appear until the first half of 2026, but Qualcomm is setting some great expectations: 18-core and 12-core processors with serious multicore CPU muscle, a field-leading TOPS count on its neural processor (an 80 TOPS NPU), and a redesigned graphics core.\n\nWith Intel on the ropes but now poised to work more closely than ever with Nvidia on co-designed \"RTX\" SoCs, with AMD benefitting from the power vacuum left by Intel, and with Apple Silicon going strong, it's the wildest time ever to cover laptop processors. PCMag's John Burek and Wired's Luke Larsen were given the opportunity to sit down with one of the company’s senior executives to chat about the new Snapdragon X2 Elite family. We quizzed Kedar Kondap, SVP and GM of Qualcomm's Compute division, on various aspects of the new X2 chips: their makeup, the new Snapdragon Guardian tech designed to appeal to enterprise, and how to cool these fierce-looking chips. The interview has been slightly edited and shortened for clarity.\n\nMarket Successes for Snapdragon X So Far\n\nPCMAG: We've seen various numbers from different sources—adoption numbers relative to the rest of the market—for the initial Snapdragon X Elite. Do you have anything that you can, want, or are able to share in terms of market percentages, numbers in terms of units sold, things of that sort?\n\nKONDAP: I can get you the right numbers that we've shared publicly, but we announced that at earnings. When you look at categories where we were focused—which is devices that are thin-and-light, $600 and above, with integrated GPU—in certain markets I think we've done really well...\n\nSo, approximately 9% of Windows laptops above $600 in the US and the top five European countries. These are the regions we focused on primarily in the first launch. We wanted to make sure that we were focused in how we delivered X Elite into the market. And it was staggered, right? We launched X Elite in June 2024; we launched X Plus devices in September at IFA last year; and then the X came in January. We announced in January, and devices came a little bit after that.\n\nWIRED: I'm curious—you probably don't have the numbers for this—about consumer purchases. Obviously, with some of the stuff announced, you are trying to push into enterprise more, which is where the big numbers are. Can you talk about how you are doing for consumers, people buying directly from stores and online?\n\nKONDAP: Yeah. The market, as you put it, is segmented between consumer and commercial. We focused the first launches on consumer. We've done a lot of pilots and enterprise trials. Those are in progress. We're a lead partner, in IT, ourselves. We've deployed more than 16,000 laptops at Qualcomm, so we're obviously leading the wave here. From a consumer standpoint, your question was more around, how did we approach the consumer segment?\n\nWIRED: I'm just wondering if you guys are doing better in that specific target [market] than enterprise?\n\nKONDAP: So our first focus was that we targeted consumer. Look at the investments and the strategy that we had. Products were very consumer-focused. We partnered with retailers, consumer retailers, globally. We had 50-plus retailers that we partnered with to have devices available. We focused on OEM dotcom channels. So, like, all of the OEM channels had devices. We announced more than 9,300 stores, and some of them even had a Snapdragon-branded kiosk. And the reason for us to do that is to build a relationship with the consumer. We wanted the consumer to understand: One, to understand the brand, but second, also to understand these experiences. The AI stuff is new, and there's not one specific app, or one use case, that's going to fit everybody....\n\nBut in parallel, we have started enterprise trials. Like I said, Qualcomm has led the way, but we have other partners like SAP and many others that have already deployed or are testing actively. We know that takes a little bit longer. Part of why we introduced Snapdragon Guardian today is to showcase more benefits to enterprises and what we can offer.\n\nAbout Snapdragon Guardian\n\nWIRED: I assume Guardian will be offered in all laptops, not just those sold directly into commercial?\n\nKONDAP: The use cases—obviously, it depends. For example, an OEM wants to sell it into the consumer space and add a capability with Guardian. You have the ability to track a PC, manage a PC. I'll give you a good use case.\n\nKids, for example, right? Many schools allow for kids to carry laptops, but they don't allow them to carry phones. So great use case: You know, today, on phones, people have Life360, or one of these apps that you can track where your kids are. You can geofence stuff. Think of it as something very similar. You have the ability to geofence where your kids are, have it on a laptop, and be able to manage it remotely. You can access what they're doing. So we want to give that control to consumers. So it's both a consumer and a commercial thing—but obviously it benefits largely commercial enterprises.\n\nWIRED: Will it be that when people buy those laptops, will they experience that? As in, are OEMs going to use that technology, then rebrand it? Or are we going to see it directly, like a feature in every laptop?\n\nKONDAP: I don't think we're ready to talk about that yet. But we wanted to showcase the technology and what we built because we have added the Guardian technology as a separate subsystem in our platform. So we've taken the steps to make sure that it is a secure subsystem within our SoC, and it provides the ability for our OEM partners to build on top of that. They can choose to offer it either in consumer or commercial. We're providing the foundation, if you will.\n\nPCMAG: About the Guardian stuff, I heard a mention in the presentation that it would be available even if the system was powered off. I was trying to figure out how that works. Are you able to talk on that?\n\nKONDAP: It is a separate subsystem within the SoC, and it connects to a cellular modem. The whole system stays in a low-power island. You can wake the modem up, which will wake up the subsystem. Now, as you know, that can go through multiple scenarios—like, for example, if it's a dead-battery situation, then obviously you can't do anything about it. But then, at the same time, our intent is offering this to enterprise or IT administrators. We want to give them the control to manage devices better, and the risk of a malicious attack is low if you're in a dead-battery situation. So as long as the user plugs in the laptop and brings it up to a certain threshold of battery, you have the ability to wake it up and just push a patch, or be able to do any activities...\n\nPCMAG: Disable it, or whatever the case.\n\nKONDAP: It's totally up to the IT administrators.\n\nSome SoC Particulars\n\nPCMAG: Question on the SoC. I was looking at the specs we were given and noticed that there were different memory allocations for the three different X2 SKUs announced so far. The first, the Elite Extreme, is at 48GB. The others were listed as \"device-dependent.\" And I was just wondering why the 48GB ceiling was landed upon. Any particular reason?\n\nKONDAP: I think the X2 Elite Extreme devices you saw, that we were running, had 48GB of memory. Honestly, we just picked the 48GB because that is still a pretty sweet spot. There's no science behind it. The X2 Elite can address up to 128GB. 48GB is already big for most users. So there's no science behind why we picked that.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nPCMAG: Is there anything you can speak to in terms of the Adreno GPU? The efficiency gains that were claimed on stage today are pretty impressive. And any insight into how you got to that point versus the first gen?\n\nKONDAP: It's a completely new Adreno GPU, designed ground up for this stuff. It has a new architecture, better shader pipelines. The entire GPU is new. It's not iterative. It is a new generation. And of course, if you're able to attend the sessions after this, we will go into a lot more technical details on exactly how it is done. But yes, it's a completely new architecture, and that's how we're able to get the performance gains as well as the power efficiency.\n\nPCMAG: One other thing that came up when I was talking with some of the folks in the benchmarking session that we had yesterday. The two reference desktops shown—I understand that they're being cooled with AirJet—Frore Systems' AirJet cooling—one of the reps told me?\n\nKONDAP: We have the option to do both. I should say, technically, you have the option to do three things. One, you can have the option to enable this with a fanless design. You can get close to at least 12 watts TDP, if not a little bit more. Or, you can use a regular fan. Or, you can use AirJet. And so, right now, we have two of the SKUs, I believe, that we're showing here. One of the designs is fanless, and the other one has AirJet, which gives you close to 25 watts TDP.\n\nIt's just an option that we want to showcase—that in the same X2 Elite or the X2 Elite Extreme, you can utilize the entire benefit and choose your design points, no different than laptops. And you can tell when you look at the form factors, the difference is insignificant in terms of what you can do, but you can still get 25 watts of performance at very low power.\n\nPCMAG: Thoughts on using AirJet outside of these desktops, in things like laptops? There's no reason you couldn't do that?\n\nKONDAP: No restriction. We just showcased this technology in the small form factors.\n\nMarket Positioning for the New X2 Chips\n\nWIRED: Can you talk about who the X2 Elite Extreme is for, and the thought behind offering that as a separate configuration?\n\nKONDAP: There's swim lanes, right? You have certain price points in certain swim lanes. The X1 Elite was in the price band, or I'll say the sweet spot, of $1,000 device SPs. Think of the X2 Elite as something very similar to that. The Extreme version with the 18-core CPU, with the much higher graphics core, will address a higher tier of experiences. That's part of why we focus so much on talking about gaming and creator use cases. We want to start showcasing the performance, and that's where you get the true benefit of running stuff.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nEverybody's in search of this one AI app that is going to transform. But we believe the workloads are going to get to agentic. And as you start looking at the whole scenario, all these different agents running on the device, we believe that it's going to run across all the different cores (obviously, on the NPU for low power), and it's going to run hybrid as necessary....Same reason why, for example, we added an 80 TOPS NPU. We believe that we're capping out in terms of many of the use cases that we're running, even at 45 TOPS. So we're enhancing leadership in each of those areas.\n\nWIRED: The 80 TOPS will be across the lineup, right? In the same way that 50 TOPS is across the [current Snapdragon X] lineup?\n\nKONDAP: We're keeping it constant. But the memory is different. In the X2 Elite and the X2 Elite Extreme, the memory configurations are different. DDR—the available bandwidth is different.\n\nFor example, you can address close to about 150, 152, gigabits per second in the X2 Elite. The Extreme gives you about 225, so think of it as an eight-channel DDR and a 12-channel DDR. That's the difference. In technical terms, it gives you more DDR bandwidth. And the reason to do that, obviously, is because many of the AI use cases are DDR-centric.\n\nEverybody's in search of this one AI app that is going to transform. But we believe the workloads are going to get to agentic.\n\nPCMAG: This might be a marketing question. I was looking at the initial three SKUs, and I noticed that the first SKU, the X2 Elite Extreme SKU, is 18-core, with everything else maxed out. The second one is also 18 cores, but not called Extreme. And then the other Elite is a 12-core, right? I was wondering what the marketing logic was of not making the first two 18-core chips both \"Extreme\"?\n\nKONDAP: So the difference is that with the Extreme version, because it's the higher DDR, and it is literally for \"extreme\" use cases, with AI and all of these things. The big difference between the three...all three SKUs support 80 TOPS, but the middle one and the lower one are both eight-channel. So addressability for memory is around 150 gigabits per second, and the Extreme version is the one with 225.\n\nPCMAG: Is the higher GPU performance also tied to the higher memory bandwidth?\n\nKONDAP: No...to be fair, obviously DDR also drives the GPU, drives a lot of the pipeline, drives a lot in terms of the SoC. But that's not why it is. Technically, yes, you are correct that games, or video, or those use cases, will scale because the bandwidth scales. But we've kept the graphics constant. You won't necessarily get to the same output. We just want to have the option available for everybody in case they want to use the 18-core without the extra DDR.\n\nPCMAG: About the Guardian hardware. It was said on stage that there is an SoC element that is part of the Guardian hardware. Is there any way of describing what that is?\n\nKONDAP: It's a dedicated processor within the SoC that's isolated from the rest of the other cores. It has its own BIOS. You can manage the subsystem independently without having to access the rest. So it's a more secure way of how we're able to access an independent processor within the entire SoC.\n\nBattery Life, and Why a Bigger NPU?\n\nWIRED: I noticed there was very little talk about battery life, as opposed to in the first generation—that was, you know, the thing! Anything to say about how different the battery life we're looking at [will be]? Or a kind of parity with the previous generation?\n\nKONDAP: No, it'll be better. We didn't talk in terms of specifics; then, the challenge becomes, what use cases, what do you want to run? With the first generation, we had to showcase stuff because we hadn't launched yet! [Laughter] Now, people have, like the [HP] OmniBook 5, tested out, and the claims that are made with 34 hours of battery life, they're tested. So there are third-party reports that have attested to this incredible battery life. But I showed some of the claims, as you heard; it's depending on which platform you look at: 30%, 40%, 50% better performance in the Extreme at 60% lower power. You will see improvements and gains in battery life, not just in terms of performance. But again, as you know, it's tied to use cases, how people are running it. But we will continue our leadership in performance per watt. We're going to lead the way.\n\nPCMAG: Question on the NPU. We are familiar with how things develop in CPU and GPU, but with NPU development, you're going from one number to a much larger number. How does that happen? What are the factors in chip development that enable an NPU to go from that to that in a generation? Just not being familiar with NPU architecture works.\n\nKONDAP: More details to come on Architecture Day for all of these, but look—AI, and that's why we had Steven [Bathiche] from Microsoft talk about it more technically, because there are things that are moving at such a rapid pace. It's funny, because when we talked about 45 TOPS, and were the first to introduce that in market, everybody said, 45 TOPS? Why do you need 45 TOPS?\n\nI don't know if you guys have had a chance to go through our demo area, but now you have use cases there that are utilizing 100% of our 45 TOPS, right? For example, there's an app called Collov, which basically helps you stage your home. There's no one app that's going to meet everybody's needs, but there are apps that are going to meet every different use case. What's happening is we're seeing this huge demand for NPU workloads.\n\nAt the same time, the models that we've seen have been optimized significantly. For example, when we launched, we talked about a 13-billion-parameter model back then, running on our 45 TOPS NPU with the eight-channel DDR at 130 gigabits per second. Now fast-forward. What has happened in two years is that models have shrunk. What was back then an INT8 model is now an INT4 model, sometimes an INT2 model. The accuracy is still very good. That's what Steven also addressed. We're also able to address bigger models now on the same device. Today, we're able to, in our X1 platform, in many cases, fit like a 27-billion-parameter model.\n\nSo what's happening is we looked at a macro level, at how the industry is shaping with the AI workloads and the models. Then we looked at what we believe is the future, looking at all of these agentic workloads. Let me give you an example. Think of a use case where you're going to tell your PC: Look at my calendar, try to see if I can go to Snapdragon Summit. Am I available that week? And please help me schedule with these five folks, and help me do ABCDE, and give me flight options.\n\nThat use case has multiple agents running on the device. Each agent is different. There's an agent that's looking at your calendar; there's an agent that's looking at the conflicts that somebody else might have. There's an agent that's going to look at your travel preferences and all of that. There's also a hybrid approach to this, because if your preference is Southwest, Alaska, Delta Airlines, whatever, it's going to go in and access the web to see that. OK, John would like to fly on September 20, and it says, \"Well, looks like you can make it. You're supposed to go meet Luke at so-and-so place, but it looks like we can find another option.\"\n\nWhat has happened in two years is that models have shrunk. What was back then an INT8 model is now an INT4 model, sometimes an INT2 model. The accuracy is still very good.\n\nSo those agents—I'm giving you a very rudimentary example—but think of that as workloads where we're building up workloads internally to start modeling. And that, in partnership with Microsoft as well, and looking at partnering with all the model vendors, that's how we sized up the NPU.\n\nThere's more to it. I'm still talking very rudimentary. Now, you think about LVMs [large vision models] and multi-modalities with images and creating videos. Like: I type a text prompt, I want to write a little story, and I want to get it converted into a video. How does that happen? What parts of it run on-device? That's how we start sizing up the NPU and start looking at how we want to architect this. But also the reason why, bringing it back to the higher DDR bandwidth is that we're seeing that use case there. That's why we wanted to have that option available for anybody who needs it.\n\nPCMAG: Is it also a [factor] that multiple AI demands are being made at the same time? So, having a larger NPU enables not only multiple agents, but multiple processes that may be happening in the system at the same time? Being unsure how an NPU works, can it juggle [like a CPU]?\n\nKONDAP: Yeah, it is able to in the same way. And you still have a very powerful CPU and a very powerful GPU, and you have an NPU. So the better part is now if you're offloading all of these tasks, like the agentic stuff, to your NPU, you still have a lot of CPU and GPU headroom left for you to do other tasks, right? You're still going to do your email, you're still going to do other tasks that you want to do that you've offloaded to these other pipelines, including the video and audio and all of that.\n\nWe talked about adding this NPU even to our audio blocks. That's where we look at echo cancellation, background, and all of that stuff. We're going to start running it more on these smaller NPUs. Overall, like I said, that's how we model our use cases right now.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nWIRED: [With NPU], are we still in a sort of \"build it and they will come\" situation? I know that initially, that's what it was, right? You had to get these into these computers before people could start developing. Where are we at right now?\n\nKONDAP: There are more ISVs than we can keep up with right now, the number of ISVs that are wanting to port all their stuff. And you see why specifically these creator workloads—like Ableton Live and with big voice-model stuff—these are very intense things that really do take up a lot of the NPU. And so everybody is moving toward the same thing, like enterprises are moving to agents.\n\nWe have a large customer right now that has moved a lot of their workforce in many areas...all onto agents. Like, they've moved their entire payroll to an agentic AI. There is no more payroll for them. They have, like, one person in payroll. They shrunk it from 11 down to one person. And then making sure that the agents can run payroll, they've linked it up in the back end. There are all these different use cases....I don't have to sit across the table and convince somebody that the future is AI. Those days are past us now.\n\nWIRED: Specifically on-device, right?\n\nKONDAP: It's moving on-device....The example I gave you of writing a little story and then building a video: It costs a lot of money to build that story and build a video from that story if you run it 100% in the cloud. And there's no reason to. But we're not necessarily saying everything's going to run on-device. We're just saying that's the optionality. You have the option to run a hybrid model, where you can run stuff on-device, and other parts in the cloud. That's the beauty of how this industry is going to move.\n\nPCMAG: Is there any world in which applications, AI applications, are load-balancing between the NPU and other parts of the CPU/SoC? Is that currently done today?\n\nKONDAP: Yes, it's done today. OK, but it's more power, right? The reason for the NPU is that it's a lot more power-efficient. Running anything on your NPU helps you with battery life significantly.\n\nPCMAG: And these days, what's managing the traffic around which part of the chip you're using? Is that something that's built into the app, is that something system-level? Who's arbitrating that?\n\nKONDAP: So the OS already has it. Like, we can go to your Task Manager today and see your NPU utilization relative to your CPU and GPU. So you can actually run something and see where it's being run—just the way you could run it earlier on the CPU and GPU, now you can see it on the NPU. From an orchestration standpoint, Microsoft provided—if you guys saw the announcement—Windows ML, so it makes it easier now for developers to have a cross-referenced framework that they can use.\n\nFor Qualcomm, we have our own orchestration framework. So, for example, when an ISV comes in and balances a particular use case, we have the governance in terms of what runs on the CPU, the GPU, or the NPU, or within the NPU, how do we want to run all the models. That governance we already have. We provide the orchestration ourselves.\n\nSnapdragon X, Looking to 2029...\n\nWIRED: Do you have a goal in mind for market share? What would you consider to be a success in this next generation?\n\nKONDAP: We've said our North Star. We said at our investor day, that's $4 billion in 2029.\n\nPCMAG: $4 million by 2029?\n\nKONDAP: $4 billion.\n\nPCMAG: That's a big number. [Laughter.]\n\n(Credit: Qualcomm)\n\nKONDAP: But we're also talking about a different way of how people are going to look at the PC. It's not the same as what we all see today. It will change. The interaction will change. You heard Cristiano [Amon, Qualcomm CEO] saying, \"AI will be the new UI.\" We're seeing it. I can't stress it enough.\n\n(Note: PCMag is attending Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit by invitation, but in keeping with our ethics policy, we have assumed all costs for travel and lodging for the conference.)",

      "headline": "Trump expands tariffs beyond US Supreme Court's reach",
      "content": "Live Events\n\nas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nThe fate of many of President Donald Trump 's tariffs hangs in the balance at the Supreme Court , but he is rapidly building out a backup plan.The Supreme Court is set to begin considering whether the tariffs that Trump has placed on countries including Switzerland and India earlier this year are unconstitutional. But the Trump administration has been erecting another system of tariffs that is impervious to the legal challenge.The administration has proposed or issued tariffs that cover more than a third of U.S. imports under a legal provision related to national security, known as Section 232. They include many critical products for American businesses and consumers, including cars, machinery, medical devices and semiconductors.The president expanded the use of the national security law Thursday night, saying he would put tariffs ranging from 25% to 100% on imports of pharmaceuticals, semitrucks, kitchen cabinets and furniture beginning Oct. 1.A day earlier, his administration opened investigations that could result in tariffs on industrial machinery, robotics, medical devices and personal protective gear. Tariffs on other industries, including semiconductors and the electronics that contain them, are still pending and could raise costs further for consumers and businesses.Trump has used Section 232 to issue tariffs on steel, aluminum, cars and copper. The Commerce Department, which oversees this type of tariff, has an array of other Section 232 investigations pending -- into timber, critical minerals, aircraft and wind turbines -- which could result in more tariffs.Ed Gresser, director for trade at the Progressive Policy Institute, a think tank, said the inclusion this week of medical devices and industrial machinery would significantly expand the scope of the Section 232 tariffs. Those tariffs would affect consumers, farmers, car owners, carmakers, clinics and hospitals and smaller manufacturers that rely on metals, he said.\"Basically, the administration is adding tons of costs throughout the economy,\" Gresser said.The Section 232 tariffs give the president a powerful alternative to apply tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against his use of a different law to impose levies. The court cases center on the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which he used as the legal basis for the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs he placed on most countries' exports in April.The administration also used the emergency powers law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico in February and March, in return for what it said were those countries' roles in trafficking fentanyl into the United States.Oral arguments at the Supreme Court are set for November. If the Supreme Court agrees with lower courts that the president has exceeded the authority given to him by that emergency powers law, the administration will be forced to remove the tariffs that it has imposed on dozens of countries.But tariffs issued under other legal provisions, including Section 232, would be left standing. Courts have traditionally deferred to the president on national security, and legal experts have considered the Section 232 provision as relatively secure from legal challenges.Eswar Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University , said the president \"seems eager to erect a new set of tariff barriers intended to circumvent and thwart any undercutting of his earlier tariffs by the judicial system.\"But he added that the national security justification for tariffs was \"wearing increasingly thin\" in being applied to products, including kitchen cabinets and upholstered furniture.An administration official said that Trump has long considered bolstering industries, including pharmaceuticals, as a national security priority and that a report would soon clarify why tariffs on furniture are a national security matter.The Section 232 tariffs on cars, steel and aluminum have already had major economic effects. They have sheltered some domestic producers from foreign competition, but they have significantly raised the cost of manufacturing inputs including metals and car parts, which some economists and business owners say is weighing on the U.S. factory sector.Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that manufacturers were working to increase their production in the United States, but tariffs on manufacturing inputs, including robots and industrial machinery, would significantly increase costs for manufacturers. He said that they \"could in turn stall investment in new plants and equipment right here at home at a time when manufacturers want to help President Trump create more U.S. manufacturing output and jobs.\"Trump's new tariffs on foreign semitrucks seem more limited because most heavy trucks are manufactured in the United States. A greater share of furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities are imported, however, meaning those tariffs could weigh more on consumers and contractors.The 100% tariff that Trump placed on foreign-branded pharmaceuticals could also have a limited reach because most imports of those products come from the European Union . The EU has already secured a 15% tariff on pharmaceuticals as part of a trade pact with the United States, which will apply to its products instead of the 100% rate.Trump said that he would offer exemptions to any pharmaceutical company building a plant in the United States. Most big drugmakers have responded to Trump's tariff threats with plans to build or expand factories in the United States.Those exemptions would only cover drugs that are manufactured in the United States, not all products at the company, the administration official said Friday.The next tranche of tariffs hanging over corporate America are tariffs Trump has threatened on semiconductors and devices that contain them.While the scope of the tariffs could be broad -- semiconductors are used in every device that has an on/off switch -- chip companies have lobbied to limit the impact. Trump threatened a 100% tariff earlier this year but has also proposed exemptions for chip companies building factories in the United States.At a meeting with semiconductor executives last week in Washington, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, outlined plans to use tariffs to encourage tech companies to buy chips made in the United States, according to people familiar with the meeting.Lutnick told executives that the administration wanted them to buy 50% of the semiconductors their companies use from American manufacturers, the people said. Companies that commit to buying U.S. semiconductors would get credits for each dollar spent on American semiconductors, which they can use against what they spend on foreign semiconductors. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported details of the meeting.The plan was designed to encourage companies including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm and others to purchase more chips made in the United States. In recent years, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung and Intel have spent billions of dollars to expand production in Arizona and Texas.",

      "headline": "Nvidia CEO bets $100 billion on OpenAI becoming a multi-trillion-dollar company — Jensen outlines his view on OpenAI's path to becoming one of the biggest companies in the world",
      "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes OpenAI is on track to become a multi-trillion-dollar company, citing explosive growth and scale as the foundation for what could be the fastest rise to that valuation in the industry’s history. Speaking on the BG2 podcast, Huang said that OpenAI “is likely going to be the next multi-trillion-dollar hyperscaler company.”\n\nHis comments come on the heels of a high-stakes infrastructure pact between Nvidia and OpenAI. Earlier this week, the companies announced a letter of intent for up to 10 GW of GPU-powered data centers to be deployed through OpenAI’s preferred cloud partners. Nvidia, in turn, agreed to invest as much as $100 billion in those systems as capacity comes online, making it one of the largest vendor-led bets on AI infrastructure to date.\n\nIn doing so, Nvidia is effectively underwriting the next generation of AI growth by ensuring its silicon roadmap stays in sync with OpenAI’s compute ambitions. The deal anchors future demand for Nvidia’s Rubin-class platforms and next-gen networking hardware, while also giving OpenAI early access to systems that may not reach general availability for years.\n\nIt also helps to bolster Nvidia’s dominance in the AI supply chain. Major cloud providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, have an insatiable appetite for GPU capacity, and Nvidia’s partnership strategy effectively pulls demand forward, locking hyperscalers like them into multi-year commitments while competitors like AMD and Intel are still playing catch-up. Expand the tweet below to see Jensen's explanation of OpenAI's path to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation.\n\n📁 Jensen Huang believes OpenAI is the next trillion-dollar company, and that’s why he’s investing. pic.twitter.com/bwI3ELEa4tSeptember 26, 2025\n\nAt 10 GW, OpenAI’s planned footprint and its associated capital expenditure have already pushed the plans into high-risk, high-reward territory. OpenAI recently struck a $6.5 billion expansion deal with CoreWeave, one of Nvidia’s key hosting partners, to help finance the rollout.\n\nNvidia also holds a stake in CoreWeave, and critics have raised concerns about the concentration of capital, hardware, and access among a small number of companies. However, that doesn’t seem to matter to Huang, who apparently believes that AI’s future will be defined by those who can scale infrastructure the fastest. OpenAI is outpacing even the most aggressive growth curves seen during the rise of cloud computing.\n\nNvidia’s ability to pre-sell entire generations of high-end GPUs into AI deployments will also have knock-on effects on the wider industry, including gaming card availability and workstation pricing. If OpenAI consumes a significant portion of future Rubin or Rubin Ultra supply, it could widen the gap between data center and consumer release cycles, making it even harder for consumers to obtain timely access to Nvidia’s latest hardware.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

      "headline": "Alibaba unveils $53B global AI plan – but it will need GPUs to back it up",
      "content": "Analysis Alibaba this week opened an AI war chest containing tens of billions of dollars, a revamped LLM lineup, and plans for AI datacenters in Europe. But it also prompted a flurry of questions over how it will achieve all this in an increasingly fragmented IT landscape, when critical resources are in short supply.\n\nProximity to the demand is key – in order for Alibaba to compete globally, it will need to position itself as close to its users as possible\n\nAt the mega vendor's Apsara conference in Hangzhou, China, it detailed the latest iteration of its Qwen3-Omni LLM, which can process text, images, audio, and video while generating text and speech.\n\nCritically, it is available under an Apache 2.0 license, making embedding it more tempting for companies loath to tie themselves into the ecosystems of ChatGPT et al.\n\nBut the Chinese giant also sketched out plans for a chain of AI datacenters straddling the Middle East, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. According to Reuters, it plans to invest $53 billion in AI infrastructure over three years.\n\nAlibaba already operates 91 availability zones across 29 regions worldwide, including existing facilities in London and Germany.\n\nThe new blueprint would include its first datacenters in the Netherlands, France, and Brazil.\n\nAlibaba President of International Business and Senior VP of the Cloud Intelligence Group, Dr Feifei Li said in a statement: \"Our strategic expansion of global infrastructure is designed to cater for the accelerating demand from forward-thinking customers.\"\n\nNeal Riley, AI Innovation Lead at The Adaptavist Group, told us: \"The international competition for dominance in the GenAI space has been heating up in the model arena, with strong contenders emerging from China like Qwen and DeepSeek. The move by Alibaba is going to see a similar competition across providers of infrastructure for AI tooling and systems.\n\n\"Proximity to the demand is key – in order for Alibaba to compete globally, it will need to position itself as close to its users as possible.\"\n\nIt's understood that Alibaba plans to offer a full suite of services from the new European datacenters, from standard cloud and elastic compute services up to big data analytics, machine learning, and AI.\n\nTo tempt companies into using its facilities to \"design, launch, and scale groundbreaking AI agents and applications,\" it will offer a range of resources \"including up to 2 billion free tokens on Model Studio, Alibaba Cloud's one-stop generative AI development platform, and up to $120,000 cloud credits from Alibaba Cloud.\"\n\nOne thing it's unlikely to be offering, though, is access to Nvidia's GPUs, which have become synonymous with AI infrastructure.\n\nAs a Chinese entity, Alibaba is blocked by Washington from buying Nvidia's top-end kit. At the same time, the US wants Nvidia to sell its cutdown H20 parts to China – with Washington taking a cut of those sales.\n\nBeijing meanwhile has reportedly told Chinese firms not to use those Nvidia chips.\n\nSo what alternatives are there for Chinese firms – other than sourcing full-fat Nvidia kit on the gray market?\n\nWell, there is Alibaba's own homegrown alternative, the T-Head, which is now considered able to go toe to toe with the H20, without giving a kickback to DC.\n\nSo would Alibaba be offering European consumers its own chips rather than the Nvidia parts European governments seem desperate to bring into Europe to boost the continent's AI capacity? Alibaba isn't saying.\n\nBut it's also worth noting that while Nvidia is being held back from doing chip business with Alibaba, the two announced a tie-up on physical AI – or robots depending on your point of view.\n\nAdded to chip sovereignty, there is the broader question of AI and data sovereignty.\n\nEuropean governments and customers are increasingly nervous about the likelihood of Washington leaning on cloud providers and potentially gaining access to European facilities – and the data in them. In June, Microsoft France execs confirmed that they could not guarantee that data on French citizens could never be transmitted to the US government without the explicit agreement of French authorities.\n\nBut the Chinese authorities have their own ways of leaning on cloud operators.\n\nSo will governments in the EU and beyond see Alibaba's plans as a quick boost to their own autonomy? Or would they see them as a threat and look to stymie them?\n\nThe EU's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) protocols can be deployed when it has concerns over overseas entities investing in critical national infrastructure – and datacenters are undoubtedly seen as such.\n\nThat would be just one more hurdle among the power, land, and water shortages that complicate datacenter plans. Not to mention local opposition. But it seems likely that Alibaba will be taking on datacenter capacity from specialist operators. Its first wave of German datacenters, for example, are located in Vodafone facilities in Frankfurt.\n\nThis should mean it isn't subject to the EU FDI regime. And the datacenter providers will have already done the heavy lifting around land, power, and planning. If there was any doubt about the datacenters getting beyond the drawing board, would the firm have stuck its neck out and announced them? One notable exception from Alibaba's blueprint was the UK, the site of one of Alibaba's existing datacenters.\n\nA DSIT spokesperson told us: \"Whilst we would not speculate on possible investments, datacenters are now regulated as critical national infrastructure. Government can step in to review any investment deal from any country if it might affect national security.\"\n\nGiven the recent $42 billion trade pact between the UK and US, spearheaded by the likes of Microsoft and Google, the UK has enough to chew on for now. After all, it does include around 120,000 GPUs courtesy of Nvidia. ®",

      "headline": "Kingspan chases Magnificent Seven energy with plan to float unit riding on AI boom",
      "content": "Fed up with Kingspan shares drifting behind peers and the wider market, Gene Murtagh is seeking to tap into some of the energy of the Magnificent Seven (Mag-7), the US tech stocks that have driven a three-year bull run across global equity markets.\n\nThe Kingspan chief executive revealed on Tuesday that the insulation giant founded 60 years ago by his father, Eugene, plans to float 25 per cent of its advanced building systems unit Advnsys, which is focused on supplying the global data centres boom, in Amsterdam.\n\nThe mushrooming of data centres has been turbocharged by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that has driven the share prices in recent times of Mag-7 stalwarts such as chipmaker Nvidia, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet and Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nClose to $7 trillion (€6 trillion) will need to be spent on data centres globally by 2030, driven by demand for hubs equipped to handle AI processing loads, McKinsey, the management consultancy firm, estimated in a recent report.\n\n“We’re acutely cognisant of the fact that relevant sector peers – and these are not building sector peers, they’re tech-end peers that are supplying the data centre market – are trading at and above 20 times Ebitda,” Murtagh said on a call with analysts, referring to how others in the data centre space are being valued by the stock market at more than 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Valuing Advnsys along these lines would give it an initial market capitalisation of at least €6 billion.\n\n[ Kingspan shares soar on potential €6bn flotation of unit riding data centres boomOpens in new window ]\n\nKingspan had lost more than a third of its market value in the four years before the move was announced – and was down 21 per cent on the year as it grappled with what Murtagh recently described as an ongoing “pretty unforgiving environment” for construction suppliers globally as households and businesses fret about a potential recession. The group is trading at about 10 times Ebitda – compared with its 10-year average of 13.5.\n\nCompare that with Vertiv, an Ohio-based provider of critical infrastructure and services for data centres, whose stock has soared more than 400 per cent over the past four years.\n\nOr with Trane Technologies, the Swords-headquartered but New York-listed maker of heating and cooling systems for commercial buildings, whose market value has more than doubled in the same period, to $90 billion, amid a surge in demand for its data centre air-cooling systems.\n\nThe NFL comes to Dublin: How it became the richest sports league in the world Listen | 26:19\n\nThe AI boom – like red-hot stock market trends before it – has attracted blatantly cynical pivots and rebrands from companies trying to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nBut Kingspan has been a supplier to the data centres market since before Murtagh became CEO 20 years ago. The new Advnsys unit being lined up for an initial public offering (IPO) – which combines its data centre solutions and light, air and water businesses into one – is a world leader in bespoke critical infrastructure primarily focused on data centres, ventilation and daylighting.\n\n[ Kingspan trades profit for position in US roofing raceOpens in new window ]\n\nWhile about 40 per cent of Advnsys’s earnings currently come from providing infrastructure to the tech sector, particularly to data centres, this is expected to grow to about 75 per cent of an even bigger business in the next three to five years, according to the group.\n\nCitigroup analysts reckon the subsidiary could more than double its revenue and Ebitda between 2024 and 2030, to €3.2 billion and €525 million, respectively.\n\nShares in Kingspan jumped as much as 13.5 per cent to €74.85 on Tuesday morning, but have since handed back almost half their gains as some analysts urged caution.\n\n“While we understand the [market] reaction, particularly in light of the stock’s weaker performance year-to-date, we do not yet understand how a partial IPO creates additional value, nor how the market will arbitrage valuation between the two businesses,” said JP Morgan analysts led by Elodie Rall in a note to clients.\n\nAdvnsys may attract a higher valuation multiple, but this is likely to be offset by the market giving the rest of the business – comprising insulated panels, other insulation solutions and its roofing and waterproofing unit – a lower one, she said.\n\n[ Kingspan plans €650m share buy back as half year revenues rise 8% to record €4.5bnOpens in new window ]\n\nBernstein’s Pujarini Ghosh said the market excitement earlier in the week had been “overdone” and her €70 price target on the group points to almost 3 per cent downside from here. A listing of Advnsys in New York “could potentially have helped unlock greater value given the business mix will be more heavily skewed to the US”, she said.\n\nAbout 45 per cent of the unit’s business is exposed to the US, but this is expected to rise well above 50 per cent in the coming years.\n\nMurtagh said the decision to float on Euronext Amsterdam is down to the high level of trading in stocks in that market, a lack of stamp duty there, too, and how the same accounting standard (IFRS) applies to companies in the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nFor sure, the level of trading in Euronext Dublin has slumped over the past five years amid a number of company exits and a dearth of fresh IPOs.\n\n[ How Kingspan stands to benefit from AI boomOpens in new window ]\n\nBut to avoid the 1 per cent stamp duty applied to share trading in Irish companies, Kingspan will need to incorporate Advnsys as a public limited company – or naamloze vennootschap (NV) – in the Netherlands.\n\nA nice bonus from the planned IPO is that it would, according to Murtagh. leave both Kingspan and Advnsys “essentially with zero debt” – giving them plenty of scope to invest and grow by acquisition.\n\nWhereas Kingspan’s share price tends to move with the broader construction industry cycle, Advnsys’s stock will be far more sensitive to developments in AI, making it potentially much more volatile.\n\nChinese tech group DeepSeek, for example, showed the world earlier this year that its approach to generative AI needs just a fraction of the computing power of more prominent US tools, such as ChatGPT. Could demand for data centres decline as AI systems become more efficient?\n\nOne thing’s for sure: savvy investors in Advnsys in Amsterdam will have alerts set for anything coming from another company 9,000km away. For now, Nvidia in Santa Clara, California, remains the bellwether for all things AI.",

      "headline": "Are We in an A.I. Bubble? I Suspect So",
      "content": "Let me preface this post with a disclaimer that I’ve made before: I am a perennial skeptic of pretty much all tech, which is largely a product of my personality. For one thing, I’m good at seeing what might go wrong and less good at seeing incredible upside potential. For another, I’m a consistent late-adopter when I’m not a never-adopter. And once I’ve adopted a particular technology or application thereof, I tend to stick with it long after it has been eclipsed by something clearly superior. There’s a place in finance for someone with my natural inclinations, and that place is the credit markets; I’d make an absolutely terrible venture capitalist. That’s something I’ve demonstrated both by losing money and, more notably, missing great opportunities to make money.\n\nSo my attitude toward the LLM generation of artificial intelligence has been unsurprisingly moderate at best. I’ve looked forward personally to self-driving cars—one technology that I was overoptimistic about, at least in terms of timeline—along with automated translation services, document summarization, and other applications that struck me as both plausible and potentially useful to me personally. I’m convinced that artificial intelligence has the potential, once the kinks get worked out, to successfully automate all sorts of routine white-collar work (which it is already starting to do despite the kinks not being worked out yet), and is likely also to speed up incremental improvements in manufacturing as well as a wide variety of kinds of scientific research. I do worry a lot about various downsides—the way A.I. will super-charge fraudsters and other bad actors, the way “good enough but not actually good” A.I.-created art and music will crowd out the real thing, the incredibly destructive effects it is already having on education, and the potential for significant social dislocations. But all of that is par for the course for a “normal” highly disruptive technology.\n\nWhat I’ve never believed in is super-A.G.I., or even in ordinary A.G.I. I don’t believe the current generation of technology is progressing toward something as flexible and all-purpose as human intelligence, and general super-intelligence is only possible if you have general intelligence in the first place. So the dueling scenarios of utopia and extinction have never struck me as particularly compelling. Even my moderate view, though, is premised on the assumption that A.I. will continue to advance up the steep part of the sigmoid curve for a while before hitting one or another physical constraint that creates a new inflection point and slows advances further. Yet it seems to me that we’re already starting to hit some of those constraints.\n\nThe most obvious one is electricity. America is far more invested in the quest for A.G.I. than any other player, and yet our power grid is significantly constrained, and, as the Abundance folks will explain to you ad nauseam, we’re not doing a great job of expanding it’s capacity, and are in some ways starting to go backwards. But there are other less-well-known constraints out there. We’re already running out of “training data” which means trainers need to use earlier generations of A.I. to create additional data on which to train the new generation. It should be obvious why this would be unlikely to lead to advances in capabilities that scale with earlier advances based on real-world data. Then there are the chips themselves. The demand for compute is now growing twice as fast as Moore’s Law, which means that demand for physical chips is doubling on the same time scale that computing power per chip doubles. We used to worry about an A.I. accidentally becoming a paper-clip maximizer, but if we don’t actually reach A.G.I. fairly soon we’ll have to worry about the entire economy turning into a chip maximizer. Meanwhile, we do still need significant advances just to get to my moderate scenario, because actually-existing A.I. is not yet delivering productivity gains, even in the areas, like coding, where it is most optimized to do so.\n\nNone of that means that A.I. won’t continue to advance. It just means that we may be in the phase where accelerating investment in A.I. is driven less by accelerating advances that everyone needs to jump on before they get left behind, and more by the fact that those advances are decelerating, so that players who have already invested at an extraordinarily high level have to invest more and more to have a chance of hitting their previously-established goals and timelines. That’s a classic characteristic of a bubble. Indeed, we may even be past that and into the phase where players are playing finance games to artificially inflate a bubble they have come to depend on. See this post from Michael Spencer about how the major players in A.I. have created what looks like a Ponzi scheme, with OpenAI paying Oracle for computing services, Oracle purchasing chips from Nvidia to provide those services, and Nvidia investing in OpenAI, each to the tune of twelve figures. There’s nothing unethical about that kind of daisy chain, but it does goose the numbers for all three companies even though no revenue is actually coming from the end users in the economy for whom all of this capacity is (supposedly) being built. It’s hard to believe that those companies’ CEOs are unaware of that fact, and that’s why suspicion is warranted.\n\nSo are we in an A.I. bubble? It sure looks like it to me. That doesn’t mean we won’t get large economic advances (and disruptions) out of A.I. It doesn’t even mean that we won’t ever get A.G.I. or super-intelligence, if it turns out that such things are possible and that the current technology path ultimately leads that way. But I suspect that before we get to wherever we’re going on the technology front, we’re going to hear a big, ugly pop. Which raises the question: if that’s correct, what should we do about it?\n\nMy unsatisfying answer is: probably not that much—at least not directly. Alan Greenspan’s wisdom in the face of the dot-com bubble was to say that it’s impossible for policymakers to determine definitively whether we are in a bubble or how big it might be, and that anything the government did to try to burst the bubble would be counterproductive. If there is a bubble, and it eventually bursts, the Fed should respond by cutting rates to keep the economy from tipping into recession, and if it undershoots in its response it should commit to making up for the lost ground swiftly (though implementing the latter without triggering unwanted inflation requires the Fed to corner harder in both directions than it has historically been willing or able to do). But until that happens, the Fed should hold its fire.\n\nI suspect that’s all still good wisdom. I’d also add that any government that set out deliberately to slow growth in the most vibrant sector of the economy would get its head handed to it by the voters—and if the Federal Reserve did it, that would supercharge existing efforts by this administration to threaten its independence. That political analysis applies equally well or better to attempts to regulate A.I. itself on safety or other grounds, which could well have the effect of causing the bubble to burst. Such efforts may or may not be wise, but they are much harder to implement in the middle of a bubble than before the bubble begins to inflate—and if they were to burst the bubble that would be a side effect that would cause them to be discredited which, if you actually believe such regulation is necessary for its stated purpose of safety, is not the outcome you’d want.\n\nIf the A.I. bubble were largely equity-financed, I’d leave things there. If it isn’t, though, we have to look at the financial regulatory side of the equation, because the way you get financial crises is when the banking system is threatened systemically by being over-leveraged to a financial asset that crashes. In the dot-com bubble, there was limited leverage deployed and limited banking system exposure. In the sub-prime mortgage bubble, by contrast, there was substantial leverage deployed, frequently in ways that were invisible to regulators. Which is the A.I. bubble more like?\n\nI would have guessed that it was more like the dot-com bubble, but this Noah Smith post convinced me that there might be invisible leverage to worry about. In a nutshell (you really should read the post if you are interested in the details), most of the financing of the high-flying tech companies is indeed in the form of equity, but a lot of the financing of data centers is done through asset-backed loans which are securitized and then insured. I don’t know anything about the models used for those securitizations, but the key component that can go wrong is the expected correlation between different assets in a pool. When an asset bubble bursts, that correlation can quickly get very high, and if that possibility isn’t properly built into the modeling (as it wasn’t with respect to sub-prime mortgages), then entities like banks and insurers who think they are holding negligible tail risk can suddenly face losses that are many multiples of what they could actually survive. And then you have a financial crisis.\n\nCould regulators do anything about this? Probably. The thing to focus on would be whether banks and insurance companies are adequately capitalized against the risks they are actually taking. If they aren’t, based on the regulator’s own assessment of the risk in the positions, you make them hold more capital. That’ll reduce the profitability of those positions, which will encourage the banks and insurers to unwind a portion, or at least not add more, which in turn would force data center builders to find other sources of financing. That, potentially, could burst the bubble, but it might not—A.I. companies might be able to keep going with more exotic but less systemically-threatening forms of equity financing—and if it did burst the bubble the regulatory move is sufficiently distant from the outcome that you might have a better chance politically of surviving than you would if you tried to burst the bubble directly by hiking rates or if you tried to do it indirectly by imposing A.I. safety regulations. Moreover, I suspect that if there’s a real problem growing in their portfolios, banks and insurers might themselves be quiet allies of a sensible regulatory effort. This is precisely the kind of situation where an industry will be unable to self-regulate even if it sees the potential for catastrophe, because competitive pressures will force all players to take advantage of lax regulation lest they lose market share, but the amount of profit at stake for the banks and insurers themselves can’t be anywhere near where it was in the subprime mortgage days, so we’re probably not at the point yet where that business is too big to be constrained. I’m too far away from finance these days to have anything like an informed opinion on how worried anybody should be, but if we should be worried specifically about the financial sector, there are likely things regulators could do to get ahead of the problem.\n\nBut I feel confident in saying that if there is indeed something to worry about, this administration is neither going to know nor take any action to address it. That fact should probably also figure into everyone’s assessment of how likely we are to be headed for trouble.",

      "headline": "Applied Digital Corporation (APLD): A Bull Case Theory",
      "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Applied Digital Corporation on Value investing subreddit by GloriousLebron. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on APLD. Applied Digital Corporation's share was trading at $19.83 as of September 17th. APLD’s forward P/E was 526.32 according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nWestern Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) Positioned for Growth as AI Data Demand Surges, Analysts Maintain Outperform Rating with $85 Price Target\n\nApplied Digital (APLD) has rapidly transformed from a speculative small cap into a serious player in AI infrastructure, with its stock price surging from about $3 in April to nearly $20 today. The momentum is not mere market hype but underpinned by long-term contracts and a credible execution track record. Central to this story is CoreWeave, a fast-growing AI infrastructure company backed by NVIDIA, which signed two 15-year leases with APLD worth $7 billion.\n\nCoreWeave later expanded its commitment with another 150 MW lease, bringing the total to 400 MW and raising APLD’s backlog to approximately $11 billion in contracted revenue. This revenue stream is multi-year, locked in, and set to ramp as facilities come online. APLD has already demonstrated its ability to scale rapidly, constructing 480 MW in the past 18 months. Its current flagship project, Polaris Forge 1 in North Dakota, is a 400 MW facility with the first 100 MW expected to go live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW in mid-2026, and the final 150 MW in 2027.\n\nThe company also boasts a 1.4 GW future pipeline, supported by financing from Macquarie, highlighting its ability to expand aggressively. Efficiency is a competitive edge, with direct chip cooling developed in collaboration with Dell, low-cost energy supported by North Dakota’s favorable climate, and power usage effectiveness near 1.18, giving APLD a structural cost advantage.\n\nEnergy security is equally critical, and APLD has already locked in long-term renewable and utility contracts in Texas and North Dakota to support its data centers. With management signaling advanced negotiations with a major North American hyperscaler, additional contracts appear likely. Together, these elements make APLD one of the most compelling emerging plays on AI infrastructure buildout, offering investors exposure to a company with contracted revenue, secured energy supply, and a fast-expanding capacity pipeline.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Applied Digital Corporation (APLD) by DoU92 in December 2024, which highlighted the company’s pivot to AI-driven growth, rapid data center expansion, and scalable HPC infrastructure. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 108% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as long-term contracts and operational execution underpin growth. GloriousLebron shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes major CoreWeave leases, secured energy, and an aggressive buildout pipeline.",

Assistant Science Minister Andrew Charlton said on Wednesday the government was in the process of developing an AI and data centre strategy. … In February last year, US data centre giant Equinix signed an offtake agreement with the operator of the $3 billion Golden Plains Wind Farm in Victoria to ensure its power requirements were fully offset by renewable energy. … “When Google invests in data centres, it’s done in a way that creates additional new clean energy generation capacity on the grid, helping to support systems and enable investments needed to drive productivity and prosperity,” he said.\n\n\n\n… “We need to retire coal and gas over time, but you can’t have demand going up while supply goes down,” … Read more: https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/tech-giants-pitch-data-centres-as-climate-saviours-not-threats-20250925-p5mxt6\n\nEveryone seems to be dancing carefully around explaining why Big Tech needs large subsidies to invest in Australia.\n\nI love the phrase the google representative used, “offset by renewable energy”. If they were planning to power the new data centers with renewables, they could have said “powered entirely by renewable energy”.\n\nExcept if the Aussie government caves to industry demands, it might not even be the likes of Google who will be paying for the useless new renewable energy plants. Perhaps the deal on offer is that the Aussie government has to pay for everything.\n\nIf the Aussie government pays an AI subsidy to big tech, who uses some of that subsidy to build renewable energy plants, that is functionally equivalent to the government giving much of that subsidy money directly to green energy companies, with one important exception.\n\nInstead of being a “green subsidy”, the money used to build those renewable plants can be described as an “AI subsidy”.\n\nThe government gets to shrink the embarrassment of having to openly give 10s of billions of dollars to the renewable industry, by claiming the corporate welfare is actually being used to build the future, to boost Australia’s AI capability.\n\nI mean, surely that can’t be the plan, can it? They surely wouldn’t be so sneaky and underhanded?\n\n5 8 votes Article Rating\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated",

      "headline": "Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?",
      "content": "Can Labour reverse 'desperate loss of faith' from business?\n\n7 days ago Share Save Simon Jack Business editor Share Save\n\nWPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nOne of the key audiences that the prime minister and the chancellor will have to convince at this year's Labour conference are the business leaders they targeted with a charm offensive before the election last July. The party trumpeted itself as \"the natural party of business\" and Rachel Reeves told anyone and everyone that this would be \"the most pro-business government this country has ever seen\". Labour had some big business beasts backing them. Billionaire mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell - a long-time Conservative supporter - switched his backing to Labour. Some 120 business leaders signed a letter which read: \"We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change. For too long now, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation, and a lack of long-term focus. \"Labour has shown it has changed and wants to work with business to achieve the UK's full economic potential.\" But post-election, the party sent a different message - warning of tough choices and hard times ahead, and delivered a Budget to prove it. That Budget, says John Caudwell, with its £25bn rise in employers' National Insurance, undid a lot of the goodwill the chancellor had garnered. \"I think there was a desperate loss of faith from the business community in general from the last Budget,\" he says. \"I think people were shocked at the level of negative components for businesses.\" On top of that NI rise, the National Living Wage was hiked by an inflation-busting 6.7%, with a rise of 16% for 18 to 20-year-olds. Mr Caudwell says he understands that Labour needed to raise money to shore up the public finances but felt it hit some sectors unduly hard. \"Even if you say they needed to be done, certain aspects were very unfair. So if you look at the increase in employers' NI, that really badly hit those businesses that employ tens of thousands of people on low wages, because they got hit by minimum wage and they got hit by the NI.\"\n\nPA John Caudwell says businesses were shocked at \"the level of negative components\" they faced after the last Budget\n\nOther small business owners have also told the BBC they have lost confidence. Rachel Carrell is the boss of childcare firm Koru Kids and signed that letter in 2024. She says she hopes the government can restore business confidence over the rest of the parliament. \"I wouldn't sign that letter today but they've got three or four years to turn this around. That's a really long time.\" She believes there's an opportunity to fix things in the upcoming Budget, but says \"they need to move quickly\". When is the Budget and what might be in it? While anecdotal evidence of crumbling business confidence is not hard to find, official measures show a mixed picture.\n\nThe Institute of Directors' confidence measure shows a steep fall after the last election, which compilers put down to immediate warnings issued by the government once in power that tough times and tough choices lay ahead. That was duly delivered on by the Budget and has hovered near those lows ever since. However, the government's favourite index to quote is the Lloyds Bank confidence survey, which shows confidence on the future is much more robust. Other measures, including the ICAEW and the S&P PMI measures, tend to support a more gloomy outlook. That in turn is supported by the number of businesses looking to recruit.\n\nJob vacancies have been on a downward trend since the Covid pandemic and there are 150,000 fewer staff on payrolls now than there were before the Budget bombshell, with a large part of those jobs going in hospitality. However, there is widespread hope among smaller businesses that the long-promised overhaul of business rates will come soon and in their favour.\n\nThe government points understandably to the enormous amounts of money pledged recently when tech royalty from Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and others met real royalty at US President Donald Trump's recent state visit. John Caudwell welcomed it too. \"I hear a lot of negativity about government - we hear about rich people leaving and they are useful to the UK economy, but they're not as useful as the £150bn of inward investment that we've got coming into the country to create high-paid jobs in high-technological businesses. So we have to get a balanced view on that.\" Mark Brearley runs a trolley and tray manufacturing and export business in Peckham, south London. He is less impressed with the razzamatazz surrounding the tech billionaires and their largesse. \"I'm sure it's very important to get these racy high-growth sectors to invest here. But what about the less exciting bits of the economy - the ones who are always here? We feel forgotten. \"I was hopeful that a new government would give us some help but all my costs have gone up - my business rates have doubled. I'm more cautious about investing in a new machine, a new product, hiring a new person.\" The new Employment Rights Bill, which confers greater rights and protections on employees from day one, is also adding to employers' reluctance to take on new staff.\n\nMark Brearley says small businesses like his feel forgotten\n\nThe government has made much of its plans to sweep away impediments to economic growth and has seen that acknowledged by some of the biggest investors in UK infrastructure. Just months after Labour entered Downing Street, Scottish Power announced a £24bn UK investment. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: \"The government has taken on the planning bogeyman to unlock growth and get us building. That's why the UK is now Iberdrola's biggest investment destination globally.\" Rain Newton-Smith, director general of the employers group the CBI, also gives the government high marks on the international stage. \"I think this government have navigated really difficult geopolitics. We've got a better deal with the US than others, we're forging a closer relationship with Europe and they got the deal with India. \"They've got a lot of work done internationally, and that does count. But they've really got to dial up delivery, and make sure that they they learn from the mistakes of last autumn.\" Business confidence is a vital but fragile thing. It's a key ingredient for any government hoping that economic growth will pay for its other spending commitments - on heath, defence and welfare. Labour has a job on its hands at conference, and at the Budget, to restore the animal spirits of UK business.",

      "headline": "Taiwan Must Help US to Make Half its Chips, Commerce Chief Says",
      "content": "Washington is demanding Taiwan move investment and chip production to the US so half of American demand is manufactured locally, outlining a radical shift for the global semiconductor industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe US has held discussions about that with Taipei to reduce the risks of over-reliance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with NewsNation. It was the only way to effectively counter Beijing’s threats to invade a self-ruled island it views as its own, Lutnick argued.\n\n“That’s been the conversation we had with Taiwan, that you have to understand it’s vital for you to have us produce 50%,” he said. The US aims to get to “maybe 50% market share of producing the chip and the wafers — the semiconductors — we need for American consumption. That’s our objective,” Lutnick said during the interview.\n\nUS officials have for years warned about an over-dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and its giant ecosystem of suppliers, which together make and supply the vast majority of the world’s most advanced chips. That risk emerged particularly during Covid-era shortages that highlighted how semiconductors fueled industries from car-making to military technology and AI.\n\nTSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is one of the centerpieces of a US government effort to entice manufacturing back home.\n\nIt has pledged to invest $165 billion to ramp up production at its US sites. But shifting capacity en masse will require not just enormous capital but also the large-scale migration of scores of suppliers and partners that together comprise TSMC’s production chain.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Washington was weighing a broad plan to reduce its reliance on overseas semiconductors, saying companies must produce as many chips in America as they import from other sources or face additional tariffs. Lutnick didn’t elaborate in the NewsNation interview about how the US would convince Taipei to get behind his objective.\n\n“We’re still fundamentally reliant upon you because we can’t live without the other half,” Lutnick said. “It will shock everybody how successful we are.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "content": "Just as Open AI CEO Sam Altman and Meta leader Mark Zuckerberg begin acknowledging that there may be truth to the warnings of an AI bubble, Jensen Huang is doubling down on his bullishness.\n\n\n\nIn a recent podcast appearance with Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner, the Nvidia CEO brushed aside the growing caution and instead zeroed in on the company he sees as the next dominant force: OpenAI.\n\n“OpenAI is very likely going to be the world’s next multitrillion-dollar hyperscale company,” Huang said.\n\nThat bold prediction comes at a moment when even AI’s loudest evangelists are warning of overvaluation and overbuilding. Altman himself has cautioned that too much money is flooding into unproven AI ventures, while Zuckerberg has compared today’s infrastructure frenzy to past bubbles. Yet Huang insists the skeptics are missing the deeper forces reshaping the economy. In his telling, the story comes down to basic physics, not hype.\n\n\n\n“General-purpose computing is over,” Huang said, describing what he sees as a generational shift in how all industries will run. “The future is accelerated computing and AI.”\n\nHe outlined what he calls the “three scaling laws” of AI—pretraining, post-training, and inference—each of which exponentially increases demand for compute. While training workloads have already been well-documented, Huang stressed that inference—the real-time reasoning that underpins everything from chatbots to recommendation algorithms—is only just beginning.\n\n“The longer you think, the better the answer you get—and thinking requires more compute,” he explained.\n\nThat framing matters because inference is where AI collides with day-to-day usage. Training runs happen in bursts, but inference happens constantly: Every chatbot prompt, every AI video render, every background algorithmic tweak consumes processing power. If Huang is right, that relentless demand means AI won’t follow the boom-and-bust cycles of earlier technologies but will instead drive a compounding need, one that will also boost Nvidia.\n\n$100 billion bet on OpenAI\n\nHuang’s comments came just days after Nvidia announced its most audacious deal yet: a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help fund the company’s massive data center build-out. It’s the largest example of what analysts call Nvidia’s “circular financing” strategy, in which it invests in, or lends to, customers who in turn spend billions on Nvidia’s GPUs.\n\nTo Huang, it’s a smart way to align incentives with a once-in-a-generation partner scaling faster than any company in history. “If that’s the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there is one of the smartest investments we can imagine,” he said.",

If you get it right then they say you got lucky or \"even a broken clock is right twice a day\".\n\nIf you get it wrong then you're full of s***.\n\nThe 5070Ti Super not getting any additional cores seems like a bit of a waste. It already has 16GB VRAM which seems plenty for games for the likely useful lifespan of the 5070Ti. So Nvidia are proposing a 50W power draw increase and presumably a price bump for zero extra performance and more VRAM than it can realistically use - which to me seems like a very dumb and pointless product launch. Honestly, the most useful situation for these 24Gbit GDDR7 chips is to consolidate the 5060Ti into a single 12GB model rather than have the 8GB model which is short of VRAM and the 16GB model which is probably more than the 5060Ti will ever have the horsepower to use.There are 14 disabled SMs in the 5070Ti and presumably yields have improved over the year since the 50-series launch so maybe the 5070Ti could enable 4 more without cannibalising the 5080 any more than it already does? The 5070 Super gets 2 more SMs than the 5070 for just a 25W increase, and whilst 12GB is enough for 99% of scenarios right now, it is a limit that the 5070 can hit and you have to imagine that more games that push beyond 12GB are coming in the next few years. That doesn't mean I won't buy a 5070 12GB, but I'm unwilling to pay much more than the ~$500 discounted price for a GPU that's light on VRAM at the tail end of 2025.IMO he gets a lot of info from his contacts at AIB partners and distributors that is unique to his channel and proven to be accurate.He retcons stuff and he theorises too, but for all the hate he gets I still add him to my news list because it's often better and more based on hard evidence than a lot of the leaks and rumours going around at the same time.",

However, since the report, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)’s shares have lost 5.5%. Discussing the report in his Mad Money appearance later during the day, Cramer commented:\n\n“Coming into Micron’s earnings, I was wondering if the company could report anything that could justify the stock’s incredible run.

Altman himself has cautioned that too much money is flooding into unproven AI ventures, while Zuckerberg has compared today’s infrastructure frenzy to past bubbles. Yet Huang insists the skeptics are missing the deeper forces reshaping the economy. In his telling, the story comes down to basic physics, not hype.\n\n\n\n“General-purpose computing is over,” Huang said, describing what he sees as a generational shift in how all industries will run. “The future is accelerated computing and AI.”\n\nHe outlined what he calls the “three scaling laws” of AI—pretraining, post-training, and inference—each of which exponentially increases demand for compute. While training workloads have already been well-documented, Huang stressed that inference—the real-time reasoning that underpins everything from chatbots to recommendation algorithms—is only just beginning.\n\n“The longer you think, the better the answer you get—and thinking requires more compute,” he explained.\n\nThat framing matters because inference is where AI collides with day-to-day usage. Training runs happen in bursts, but inference happens constantly: Every chatbot prompt, every AI video render, every background algorithmic tweak consumes processing power. If Huang is right, that relentless demand means AI won’t follow the boom-and-bust cycles of earlier technologies but will instead drive a compounding need, one that will also boost Nvidia.\n\n$100 billion bet on OpenAI\n\nHuang’s comments came just days after Nvidia announced its most audacious deal yet: a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help fund the company’s massive data center build-out. It’s the largest example of what analysts call Nvidia’s “circular financing” strategy, in which it invests in, or lends to, customers who in turn spend billions on Nvidia’s GPUs.\n\nTo Huang, it’s a smart way to align incentives with a once-in-a-generation partner scaling faster than any company in history. “If that’s the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there is one of the smartest investments we can imagine,” he said.\n\nBut to markets, the sheer size of the commitment was jarring.\n\nDeutsche Bank had previously warned that 2025 could be remembered as “the summer AI turned ugly,” pointing to the risk that circular revenue-recognition games could inflate demand.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts said Nvidia’s way of helping fund its own customers reminds them of past bubbles, when companies juiced sales by essentially paying buyers to buy their products.\n\nThey warned that even if these deals are only a small slice of revenue right now, Nvidia is so big that any slipup could shake the whole stock market.\n\nAs they put it, the stock is “priced for perfection,” which means there’s not much room for mistakes if AI growth cools off.\n\nThat tension helps explain why Altman, despite running Nvidia’s most important customer, has been publicly warning of “a frenzy of cash chasing anything labeled AI.”\n\nAnd Zuckerberg, while still pouring billions into Meta’s own AI ambitions, has likewise admitted the infrastructure build-out carries “bubble-like” characteristics reminiscent of railroads and the dotcom era. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has taken note, pointing to the “unusually large amounts of economic activity” flowing into AI, a rare signal that the froth is on the Fed’s radar.\n\nHuang remains unmoved. To him, these warnings miss the forest for the trees. He insists that Nvidia and OpenAI’s growth is propelled by scaling laws and performance per watt—fundamentals that make his company the only rational choice for hyperscalers.\n\n“This is the industrial revolution,” he told Gurley and Gerstner, a common refrain from Huang on the subject of AI.\n\nHuang also seemed to flip his stance on President Donald Trump’s recent $100,000 H-1B visa fee. He called the policy “a great start” for cracking down on visa abuse and illegal immigration, but cautioned that the steep price tag “probably sets the bar a little too high.”\n\nFor Huang, himself an immigrant, Trump’s fee may be a useful first step, but only if it’s paired with broader reforms that keep America attractive to top talent.",

First, it is in Nvidia's interest to kill Intel's Arc graphics, and that would be very bad because it is the only thing brighing GPU prices down for consumers. Second, the death of Intel graphics / Arc would be extremely bad for Linux, because Intel's approach to GPU drivers is the best for compatibility, wheras Nvidia is actively hostile to drivers on Linux. Third, Intel is the only company marketing consumer-grade graphics virtualization (SR-IOV), and the loss of that would make Nvidia's enterprise chips the only game in town, meaning the average consumer gets less performance, less flexibility, and less security on their computers.\n\nCompletely useless to your career but still great 🙃\n\nBest Resource of the Month 🥽\n\nBig O.

      "headline": "'Much of the value creation in the semiconductor industry is occurring outside the EU' says EU member states, and they want a fresh plan to claw some chips back",
      "content": "A new declaration from all 27 EU member states lays out an \"urgent need\" for a new and improved EU Chips Act. Essentially, Europe feels like it's fallen behind in chip production and design, and it would like to see a concerted effort from the European Commission to regain ground.\n\n\"To secure and strengthen our global position,\" the declaration reads (via The Register), \"the EU must prioritize the semiconductor sector as a strategic industry, on par with aerospace and defence, and treat it as a key target for investment, R&D and innovation, and—if necessary—use the available instruments to protect it and act collectively.\n\n\"However, while global competitors are significantly ramping up public investment, much of the value creation in the semiconductor industry is occurring outside the EU,\" it continues. \"This underscores the need for a strengthened, second-phase EU Chips Act that is both ambitious and forward-looking.\"\n\nYou have to agree with the signatories here, which represent each of the countries within the EU today, that Europe has slipped up with chip production. An OECD report (PDF) on the semiconductor value chain shows how the largest exporters of chips tend to be in Asia, such as China, Korea, and Taiwan, with companies in the US making the most money from these chips, as per this Semiconductor Industry Association report.\n\nEurope does have a place at the table with big firms such as Dutch company ASML, which builds most of the world's cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing machines. There are also companies such as Infinion, Europe's largest chip manufacturer, and Arm, thought the latter was previously sold and since listed on a stock exchange outside of Europe. Though this 2020 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association suggests the EU only makes up for 9% of global manufacturing capacity—lower than some individual countries such as Taiwan (22%), South Korea (21%) and Japan (15%). It also suggests this share will decrease by 2030 to 8%.\n\nDutch company ASML leads in EUV lithographic machinery. (Image credit: ASML)\n\nAs the declaration rightly points out, when you're depending on semiconductors for \"enabling necessary societal transitions\", you sort of want to be in a good place to produce the ones you require, especially as global trade and relationships can be so easily fractured.\n\nHere's what the report suggests should be the objectives of a revised EU Chips Act:\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Indispensability: maintain and develop Europe’s technological and innovation leadership to secure critical control points in the global semiconductor value chain. Resilience: secure a stable and reliable supply of trustworthy semiconductors for Europe’s most critical sectors, particularly in times of global disruption or geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nYep, that all checks out. What self-respecting country or country bloc wouldn't want these things? That's the issue here, it's not what you say, it's how you do it. And competing in the highly-competitive world of semiconductors, especially when you're already behind the times, is going to be excruciatingly tough going.\n\nThis is the revised Chips Act, so what happened to the original one?\n\nThat's still very much in play, operating to increase the EU share in the \"global market value chain by revenue\" to 20% by 2030. The big issue is how realistic the act is. Right now, the EU is expected to be around 11.4% by 2030, as laid out in this report on the EU's digital transition. This being so unrealistic is one of the main causes for concern at the original Chips Act, as noted in a special report by the European Court of Auditors, who suggest the target may have been \"overly ambitious\".\n\nIntel's now cancelled megafab facility, which was set to be built in Magdeburg, Germany. (Image credit: Intel Corporation)\n\n\"We recommend that the Commission carries out an urgent reality check and swiftly begins preparing the next strategy,\" the special report published in April says.\n\nThe EU has opened a public consultation on the Chips Act, too, asking for evidence to review the effectiveness of the act.\n\nWell, these many reports won't do very much on their own. The original, surprisingly lightweight declaration suggests a few key topics for a future revision to the Chips Act. Here's the quick version:\n\nCollaboration between industries, supporting tech champions, and fast-tracked legislation.\n\nPublic and private investment and cross-industry collaboration, including quantum and AI fields.\n\nSupporting skilled workers.\n\nSupporting the green transition and clean energy.\n\nFoster global collaboration.\n\nThere are some fine details in there on specific programs for skilled workers or funding programmes, though most represent points that I think anyone with a half-decent idea of semiconductors would also end up with if tasked with a plan of action for Europe. That's not to say it's ineffective, as it's clearly a signal of intent with powerful backers (every EU member state, don't forget), but the real question remains: how much money is the EU prepared to spend on this?\n\nThe US rolled out its own CHIPS and Science Act back in 2022 under the Biden administration, which invested roughly a couple hundred billion dollars into US chipmaking and research. That has ended up being tweaked by the current president, Donald Trump, as he used funds previously awarded to Intel under the act to buy shares in the business instead. This deal struck with Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who also canned the company's planned European megafab, which was a big part of Europe's optimistic push into more domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel still operates a big fab facility in Ireland.\n\nThe Trump administration has also pushed Nvidia and AMD into deals relating to their China business, and pushed chip designers (so-called fabless companies) to buy more of their chips from US manufacturing than foreign fabs. You can see the difference between carrot and stick here, right? China also recently rolled out similar measures to block local firms from buying up foreign-made tech, including Nvidia's purpose-made and only very recently green-lit AI chips.",

      "headline": "Advancing Anomaly Detection for Industry Applications with NVIDIA NV-Tesseract-AD",
      "content": "In a recent blog post, we introduced NVIDIA NV-Tesseract, a family of models designed to unify anomaly detection, classification, and forecasting within a single framework. That work demonstrated the promise of tackling diverse time-series problems with a shared, general-purpose backbone.\n\nNVIDIA NV-Tesseract-AD builds on this foundation but takes a more specialized path. Rather than relying only on transformers, it introduces diffusion modeling, stabilized through curriculum learning, and pairs it with adaptive thresholding methods in a model purpose-built for anomaly detection. Together, these elements address some of the most challenging issues in the field: noisy, high-dimensional signals that drift over time and contain rare, irregular events.\n\nEqually important, NV-Tesseract-AD represents an evolution, not a reset. The first version of the model was confined to univariate datasets and often faltered in the presence of noise. Version 2.0 expands the architecture to handle multivariate inputs, uses curriculum schedules for reliable training, and incorporates adaptive thresholds to deliver greater robustness in real-world settings.\n\nWhy anomaly detection needs a rethink\n\nAnomaly detection seems obvious: find ‌unusual points in a data stream. But anyone who has worked with real-world time series knows it’s one of the most frustratingly complex problems in data science.\n\nThe challenge begins with non-stationarity. Few signals ever sit still. Semiconductor sensors drift as machines wear down. Patient vitals fluctuate in response to circadian rhythms, meals, and physical activity. Spacecraft telemetry looks completely different depending on whether a rover is cruising, drilling, or idling. Cloud KPIs surge during traffic spikes, fall quiet at night, and spike again during batch jobs. What appears anomalous at one moment may be entirely normal the next.\n\nThen there’s noise and sparsity. Labels are rare and often unreliable. Ground-truth anomalies are expensive to capture. Operators can only label what they observe, and even domain experts may disagree on whether a fluctuation is a real fault or just natural variability. Many datasets are littered with false positives or miss the very failures we hope to detect.\n\nFor example, in nuclear power plants, thousands of sensors continuously track reactor pressure, coolant flow, and core temperature. Genuine anomalies—such as a small coolant leak or an early-stage pump failure—are rare, and a subtle pressure fluctuation might be dismissed as routine noise. If misclassified, it could conceal the early stages of a cascading failure that poses a threat to reactor safety.\n\nSituations like this show a broader challenge across industries: sparse and unreliable labels make supervised learning prone to overfitting on a small, noisy dataset while overlooking critical patterns hidden in vast amounts of unlabeled data.\n\nThese problems became evident when NV-Tesseract-AD 1.0 was tested on public machine learning datasets, such as Genesis and Calit2. Both are notoriously noisy and sparsely labeled. Version 1.0, trained only on univariate signals, produced trivial detections or failed outright. What looked promising in toy settings crumbled when faced with the messiness of real-world data.\n\nKey insights:\n\nTraditional statistical methods assume stability and collapse under drift or regime change.\n\nEven deep learning models falter when data is noisy, labels are sparse, or distributions shift.\n\nGenerative methods, and especially diffusion models, open a new path by learning the manifold of “normal” behavior itself.\n\nDiffusion models for time series\n\nGenerative diffusion models were originally designed for images, but their underlying principle maps elegantly to time series. Instead of reconstructing a signal in one shot, diffusion models gradually corrupt data with noise and then learn to reverse the process step by step. The result is a model that captures fine-grained temporal structure and can scale to hundreds or thousands of correlated signals (see arXiv:2508.06638 for methodological details, patent pending).\n\nThis iterative refinement is powerful. Subtle deviations—like a micro-variation in a patient’s heartbeat or a slight drift in a satellite’s battery voltage—are clear when the model learns the manifold of “normal” trajectories. Signals that can’t be denoised smoothly stand out as anomalies, not because they trip a hard threshold, but because they break the underlying structure of the data.\n\nBut diffusion comes with its own fragility. If training begins with tasks that are too complex, like fully corrupted signals or high masking ratios, the model may collapse into trivial reconstructions or fail to converge. NV-Tesseract-AD addresses this challenge with curriculum learning. Early training epochs focus on lightly corrupted inputs, where denoising is straightforward. Over time, ‌noise and masking are gradually increased, forcing the model to master increasingly complex reconstructions.\n\nThis “easy-to-hard” progression stabilizes training, reduces variance in outcomes, and produces models that generalize more effectively once deployed. In practice, curriculum learning has been the difference between fragile experiments and systems that can handle the unpredictability of production data.\n\nFigure 1. Curriculum training schedule in NV-Tesseract-AD\n\nSegmented Confidence Sequences and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments\n\nDiffusion models generate anomaly scores. But those scores still need thresholds to drive decisions, and thresholds are often the weakest link. Static cutoffs fail when signals drift, as manufacturing tools recalibrate, patients transition from rest to activity, and networks fluctuate between peak and off-peak demand. In such environments, global thresholds either miss real anomalies or generate false alarms that overwhelm operators.\n\nTo address this, NVIDIA researchers developed two patent-pending methods—Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments (MACS). Both are unsupervised, model-agnostic, and grounded in confidence interval theory, making them interpretable and broadly applicable beyond NV-Tesseract-AD. These methods are part of the inference process, specifically during the threshold-setting stage of the anomaly detection pipeline, where they determine when a deviation should be considered significant.\n\nSCS divides the time series into locally stable regimes, each with its own statistical baseline. Confidence bounds adapt within each regime, ensuring sensitivity where it’s needed and restraint where natural variance is high.\n\nFigure 2. Segmented thresholds adapt to new regimes by establishing local statistical bounds\n\nMACS examines data through short-, medium-, and long-term windows simultaneously. An attention mechanism weighs the most relevant scale, while a dual-detection rule reduces the number of spurious alerts. This allows MACS to capture quick bursts and gradual drifts without requiring separate detectors.\n\nFigure 3. Multi-scale thresholds capture anomalies that appear as quick bursts, gradual drifts, or overlapping patterns.\n\nTogether, SCS and MACS strike a balance that has long eluded anomaly detection: sensitive enough to catch subtle faults, yet disciplined enough to avoid overwhelming operators with noise.\n\nKey insights:\n\nSCS adapts thresholds to locally stable regimes, improving recall while controlling false alarms.\n\nadapts thresholds to locally stable regimes, improving recall while controlling false alarms. MACS views data at multiple timescales, capturing both bursts and drifts with fewer spurious alerts.\n\nviews data at multiple timescales, capturing both bursts and drifts with fewer spurious alerts. Both are patent-pending NVIDIA innovations, unsupervised and interpretable, with applications beyond NV-Tesseract-AD.\n\nFrom evaluations to real-world impact\n\nOur evaluations weren’t about topping leaderboards. The question we asked was simpler: what happens when you apply diffusion techniques and adaptive thresholds to noisy, multivariate datasets?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in our tests on the Genesis and Calit2 public datasets, the difference between the versions was stark. Version 1.0 produced trivial results or nothing at all. But version 2.0, with diffusion and adaptive thresholds, could separate actual structure from noise, surfacing anomalies that aligned with irregularities previously invisible to the system. The key difference wasn’t just accuracy, but also robustness: it maintained performance even under the very noise and sparsity that crippled older approaches.\n\nThat resilience translates directly into real-world situations. In healthcare, the problem isn’t the absence of anomalies but the flood of false alarms. Clinicians in an ICU can’t act on every minor fluctuation in vital signs. What they need is a system that learns patient-specific baselines, dynamically adapts thresholds, and surfaces only the deviations that matter. NV-Tesseract-AD demonstrates how this approach can reduce nuisance alerts, build clinician trust, and expedite responses when a genuine anomaly arises.\n\nIn aerospace, telemetry encompasses thousands of channels that vary significantly across different phases of a mission. A static threshold may swamp operators with alerts when a spacecraft changes mode, or worse, miss the subtle drift that precedes a critical failure. By combining diffusion modeling with adaptive thresholds, NV-Tesseract-AD shows how anomaly detection can distinguish between expected regime shifts and true anomalies—surfacing signals, such as unexpected torque variations in a rover wheel, before they become mission-ending.\n\nIn cloud operations, reliability hinges on monitoring a vast array of metrics, where both sudden spikes and long-term trends are crucial. Operators don’t just need alerts—they need alerts they can trust. Multi-scale thresholds allow NV-Tesseract-AD to flag a rapid burst of API errors without confusing it for a longer-term drift, or to catch a creeping memory leak that static thresholds would miss. The result is faster incident response and less noise in the dashboards that engineers depend on.\n\nKey insights:\n\nEvaluations on noisy datasets, such as Genesis and Calit2, show how diffusion with thresholds outperforms v1.0.\n\nReal-world impact lies in reducing false alarms in healthcare, distinguishing regime shifts in aerospace, and filtering noise in cloud operations.\n\nThe framework shows resilience to noise and drift, a prerequisite for trust in mission-critical settings.\n\n\n\nA promising direction for the next generation of anomaly detection\n\nAnomaly detection has always been one of AI’s most persistent challenges. Static rules fail in the face of drift, and even advanced deep learning models collapse in noisy, high-dimensional environments. NV-Tesseract-AD represents a shift in approach, combining diffusion modeling, curriculum learning, adaptive thresholds, and careful design refinements into a framework for developing more intelligent anomaly detection across industries.\n\nOur evaluations show that when diffusion and adaptive thresholds are applied, anomaly detection systems become more resilient to noise, more capable of handling multivariate complexity, and more trustworthy in the eyes of operators. While broader evaluations and refinements are still ongoing, ‌work to date suggests a promising direction for developing the next generation of anomaly detection systems.\n\nGet started with NV-Tesseract-AD\n\nNV-Tesseract-AD will be available initially through a customer preview under an evaluation license, offering a first look at its advanced time-series modeling capabilities. Users can bring their own datasets, run diffusion-based anomaly detection with curriculum learning and adaptive thresholds, and adjust detection sensitivity to meet their needs. The system scales seamlessly from proof of concept to exploratory production trials and integrates into existing MLOps pipelines and detection methods.\n\nContact the NVIDIA DGX Cloud team to schedule a demo, discuss your time-series requirements, and explore how NV-Tesseract-AD can become a cornerstone of your anomaly detection workflow.\n\nAttending SEMICON West Oct 7-9, 2025?

      "content": "NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang believes China's AI is only \"nanoseconds behind\" US technology.\n\nThe AI race between the US and China could be closer than any of us expected, at least according to NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nHuang, whose company supplies most of the world with specialized GPUs for AI, was a recent guest on the Bg2 podcast (via Tom's Hardware), where he spoke with the hosts about NVIDIA's ever-changing role in the Chinese AI landscape.\n\nHuang called China \"formidable, innovative, fast-moving, and underregulated,\" before busting a few myths he often hears about the country that poses the largest threat to NVIDIA's AI dominance.\n\nRegarding the myth that China could never build its own AI chips — \"That just sounded insane.\" Regarding the myth that China can't manufacture — \"If there's one thing they can do, it's manufacture.\"\n\nAnd, perhaps most consequential in the scope of global AI domination, Huang busts the myth that China is years behind the US.\n\nThey're years behind us. Is it two years? Three years? Come on. They're nanoseconds behind us. And so we've got to go compete. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA CEO\n\nNVIDIA has been a significant part of China's tech market for 35 years, and Huang offers some insights as to how it has so quickly caught up to the US. \"Don't forget that China has some of the best STEM schools in the world,\" says Huang, before mentioning China's culture and how it has shaped the Chinese workforce.\n\n\"They're the most hungry in the world,\" states Huang, referring to China's \"9AM until 9PM, 6 days a week\" working culture.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nNVIDIA hasn't had an easy time of late getting its AI chips into China.\n\nThe company was banned from selling its H20 AI GPUs — essentially nerfed versions of US tech designed specifically to get around Biden-era restrictions — to China in April 2025 by the Trump administration.\n\nAfter some lobbying by Huang, it was announced in July 2025 that NVIDIA was once again free to sell its H20 GPUs in Chinese markets.\n\nMassive demand caused projected H20 chip shortages just weeks after the ban was lifted, but security concerns from Chinese officials who urged domestic firms not to buy NVIDIA's H20 put a damper on the enthusiasm.\n\nRegardless of China's unofficial stance, NVIDIA still needed to finalize export licenses through the US government.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, it was announced in August that NVIDIA and AMD had reached a deal that would see 15% of revenue from AI chip sales to China go back to the US government.\n\nAs part of the announcement, President Trump doubled down on his insistence that the H20 isn't competitive.\n\nThe H20 is obsolete. [...] So I said, 'Listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country. US President Donald Trump\n\nSecurity concerns and the ongoing rhetoric surrounding the NVIDIA chips designed specifically for Chinese markets have, of course, muddied the situation.\n\nIn September, I reported on the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) banning its top tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, from buying and testing NVIDIA's new RTX Pro 6000D AI GPU, another chip tuned down for Chinese markets.\n\nChinese regulators then announced that it was investigating NVIDIA for antitrust violations related to its acquisition of chip designer Mellanox in 2020.\n\nHuawei's three-year plan to best NVIDIA's AI chips\n\nHuawei's logo visible on the company's headquarters building. (Image credit: Getty Images | Cheng Xin)\n\nChina's Huawei is leading the way in terms of domestic competition with NVIDIA's AI chips, and the company recently detailed a three-year plan to overtake NVIDIA's dominance in China (via Bloomberg).\n\nHuawei's next generation of Ascend AI chips will operate within a \"SuperPod\" design, which will allow for up to 15,488 chips to be linked together using new \"UnifiedBus\" technology.\n\nHuawei claims that this tech is up to 62 times faster than NVIDIA's next NVLink144 solution. NVIDIA's current NVLink72 tech can connect up to 72 Blackwell GPUs and 32 Grace CPUs, so it seems clear that Huawei is going for victory through massive numbers rather than finesse.\n\nWith these Huawei chips designed from the start for China's AI software stack, NVIDIA must be feeling the heat as it attempts to claw back what was once a 95% market share.\n\nRegardless, NVIDIA's CEO remains unfazed by China's growing AI competition, and in fact seems to encourage its growth.\n\nWe have a competitive relationship with China. We should acknowledge that China, rightfully, should want their companies to do well. I don't for a second begrudge them for that. They should do well. They should give them as much support as they like. It's all their prerogative. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA CEO\n\nIn the Bg2 interview, Huang also expresses some frustration with the current rules and regulations affecting NVIDIA's ability to compete around the world. Speaking in terms of the tech industry as a whole, Huang says:\n\nWe have to acknowledge it is our national treasure. It is our best industry. It is our single best industry. Why would we not allow this industry to go compete for its survival? For this industry to go and proliferate the technology around the world, so that we could have the world built on top of American technology.\n\nNVIDIA, of course, only stands to gain from a stable partnership with China, and this isn't the first time that Huang has expressed these same sentiments.\n\nWhile NVIDIA continues to hold sway with Chinese AI firms for now, Huawei's progress over the next three years will certainly be interesting to watch.\n\nFollow Windows Central on Google News to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!",

      "headline": "Jensen Huang Fires Back At Wall Street 'Flatlining' Nvidia Forecasts, Says AI Demand Will Crush Long-Term Expectations",
      "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against Wall Street's long-term outlook for the company, saying analysts are underestimating the scale of artificial intelligence demand.\n\nDismisses Wall Street Forecasts\n\nOn last week's Open Source podcast, Huang was asked about Wall Street consensus from 25 analysts projecting Nvidia's growth \"flatlining\" after 2027. He said he had no issue with those forecasts but argued they fail to capture the scale of AI adoption that is now underway.\n\nDuring the podcast, Huang said, “We're comfortable with that,” adding that his company has “no trouble beating the numbers on a regular basis.”\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nHe described a “massive divergence of belief” between what AI leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Satya Nadella are projecting and what Wall Street models assume. “Our opportunity, as I described it, is much larger than the consensus,” he said.\n\nHuang pointed to what he called “two exponentials” driving compute requirements, that is, the rapid increase in the number of users engaging with AI tools, followed by the exponential growth in compute needed per user as models move from one-shot inference to reasoning.\n\n“Until we fully convert all general-purpose computing to accelerated computing and AI... the chances [of a glut] are extremely low,” he said.\n\nSee Also: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nHuang Defends $100 Billion OpenAI Investment\n\nOn the podcast, Huang defended his decision to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, calling it “some of the smartest investments we can possibly imagine.”\n\nHuang said, “OpenAI is likely going to be the world’s next multi-trillion-dollar hyperscale company,” adding that Nvidia will be working with the company “at the chip level, at the software level, at the systems level, at the AI factory level” to help build and operate its AI infrastructure.\n\nThis comes amid growing investor concerns that the company was creating a “circular” investment loop by investing in OpenAI, which would in turn acquire chips from Nvidia.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nTrending Now:",

      "headline": "Linux Kernel 6.17 Released, This is What’s New",
      "content": "EXT4 filesystem boosts – and changes to help SSDs last longer\n\nLinus Torvalds has announced the release of Linux kernel 6.17, an update that brings improved hardware support and a number of core system improvements.\n\nThe new kernel provides graphic drivers for the latest Intel ‘Panther Lake’ laptops, better power management features for devices with AMD hybrid GPUs, resolves a software bug that’s been knocking around since 1993, and helps SSDs last longer.\n\nAnnouncing the release on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), Linus Torvalds says: “No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go.”\n\nUbuntu 25.10 ships wit the new kernel, including in the beta build that was released last week. Users on the current long-term support release, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, will receive kernel 6.17 as part of the next hardware enablement (HWE) update in early 2026.\n\nIs this kernel a solid upgrade? You know it is! For a whip through the new features in Linux 6.17 which caught my eye, read on.\n\nLinux 6.17: What’s New?\n\nGraphics & Gaming\n\nAlienware’s ‘boost’ key (top row) gets a standardised keycode\n\nThe first Core Ultra Series 3 laptops powered by Intel ‘Panther Lake’ chips are due to go on sale soon, so it’s timely that Intel Xe3 integrated graphics are enabled by default in Linux 6.17. This ensures anyone bagging a new model and installing Ubuntu 25.10 gets solid graphics performance off the bat.\n\nSmartMux in 6.17 will switch between integrated and discrete graphics on AMD laptops\n\nFor those using laptops equipped with Core Ultra Series 2 (‘Lunar Lake’) chips, the Intel IPU7 driver has proper web camera support. Ideal for online meetings, social chats and accidental jump-scares when launching the camera app by accident.\n\nAMD hybrid GPU laptops gain SmartMux support with Linux 6.17. This auto-switches between integrated and discrete graphics based on workload to (obviously) save power or deliver maximum performance if needed.\n\nLenovo WMI Gaming Series Drivers add support for both Legion Go and the SteamOS-powered Legion Go S handheld, which will be especially handy for those looking to run other kinds of Linux-based operating systems on the AMD-powered handheld.\n\nThe kernel also standardises the keycode used by the (mysterious) “performance boost” key on newer Dell and Alienware laptops, and the (rather frutiger aero-looking) Flydigi Apex 5 game controller now has proper support on Linux — nice!\n\nOn a tangentially gaming-related note, the networking stack adds DualPI2 congestion control support. This helps to reduce network queue latency, which should prove beneficial for online gaming, streaming, video calls, and other real-time applications.\n\nFilesystem changes\n\nKernel write changes may help SSDs last longer\n\nThere are many filesystems improvements in 6.17 that will be directly appreciable by those of us running a desktop Linux distribution (not just the one this site is named after, either).\n\nUbuntu’s default file system is EXT4, and Linux 6.17 sees major performance boosts\n\nPerhaps most significant: the kernel can now write zeroes efficiently without actual I/O operations on NVMe SSDs that support the DEAC bit, and SCSI SSDs which support the UMMAP bit (a ‘bit’ is a kind of indicator of a feature state).\n\nThe FALLOC_FL_WRITE_ZEROES option for fallocate() will mark storage regions as zero-filled internally on modern SSDs. This will improve performance and reduce wear (SSDs theoretically have finite read/write lifespans, so fewer writes = lasts longer).\n\nUbuntu’s default filesystem EXT4 improves block allocation scalability. Per benchmarks, this provides noticeable performance benefits under I/O heavy tasks like querying databases or copying large numbers of files.\n\nBtrfs adds experimental large-folio support, which reduces memory management overhead when handling large files. This, combined with compression control during defragmentation, makes Btrfs better suited to performance-sensitive workloads.\n\nEROFS supports metadata compression and faster directory reading, which should prove especially handy on systems with read-only root filesystems or in container-heavy workloads. There’s no Bcachefs in the 6.17 merge reports…\n\nLaptop Support\n\nMacBook Pro touchbar becoming ever-more-functional in Linux\n\nLinux support on M1 and M2 Macs continues to improve in Linux 6.17, with the Apple Silicon SMC driver enabling ‘proper’ rebooting of M1 and M2 Macs. With work to run Linux on M3 and M4 Macs in limbo, it’s nice earlier gens are improving their mainline support.\n\nThe Touch Bar on Intel-based MacBook Pros see further improvements in Linux 6.17 with patches to enable touch screen input, albeit with a few lingering quirks. Apple ends support for Intel-based Macs after macOS 26, so Linux will give those devices a new lease of life.\n\nElsewhere, Linux 6.17 brings mainline support for ASUS Zenbook A14 Snapdragon X1 Plus/Elite laptops, allowing more Linux distributions to run on these ARM-based Windows devices. There’s also mainline support for Raspberry Pi 5’s RP1 I/O chip.\n\nGot a keyboard with F13-F24 keys? Those are now properly mapped in Linux 6.17\n\nSupport for Corsair HX1200i PSU monitoring (2025 model) is present; wake-on-touch support added to the Intel Touch Host Controller (along with overlay objects support, great for tablet and 2-in-1 users); and kernel mapping for F13 – F24 keys on PS/2 keyboards.\n\nYes, keyboards with an addition 12 function keys actually exist!\n\nHD Audio support is extended to cover the Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300, commercial ASUS laptops using CS35L41 HDA, and HP EliteBook models. USB audio offloading (a feature in Linux 6.xx) covers more mobile devices, including Fairphone 4.\n\nCore kernel changes\n\nNew Attack Vector Controls have been integrated to simplify security handling for known CPU vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown. Previously, each mitigation had its own kernel command-line option. In 6.17, there’s a unified option.\n\nMaking it easier for Linux server admins (and others) to disable unneeded protections may help them claw back performance dips certain mitigations require as well make it easier to manage the growing number of hardware vulnerability bandaids.\n\nSupport for uniprocessor configuration has been removed from the kernel scheduler. Every machine, even those which run on a single-core processor will now ‘unconditionally’ run a kernel designed for multicore systems.\n\nThis shouldn’t lead to any detrimental impact on single-core systems (not that many folks likely run one full-time in 2025), but adopting a unified scheduling approach across all CPUs should reduce code and make kernel behaviour more reliable.\n\nSpeed Boosts?\n\nLinux 6.17 picks up initial proxy execution support. This new kernel feature may speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when a high-priority application is waiting for a resource, the system temporarily gives the resource holder a boost, causing it to finish and release the resource faster.\n\nA new kernel feature could speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when high-priority tasks are waiting for a resource\n\nOr to word it the way kernel devs would, this resolves “priority-inversion problems” by enabling “high-priority tasks waiting for locks to donate execution context to lock holders”, which reduces latency spikes — slowdowns — in desktop apps.\n\nMemory management sees various optimisations across the kernel subsystems, notable with improved futex performance for heavily threaded applications (and more reliable crash kernel handling for debugging when things go wrong).\n\nAMD’s Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI) was added. Modern processors mix two types of cores: performance and efficiency. On AMD, HFI gives the kernel info to help it decide which core is better suited to which tasks, improving performance and power management.\n\nWeird Stuff\n\nLinux 6.17 removes the Pktcdvd packet-writing optical driver. It was deprecated in 2016, survived a removal attempt in 2023, but now, in 2025 optical packet-writing is definitively done and dusted! A loss for those who liked it, but a curio for those who’d never heard of it…\n\nThere’s also a bug fix for a kernel limitation dating back to 1993. It’s related to ELF program header handling that causes some applications in certain conditions to bug out. After 30 years, someone has finally bothered to fix it properly.\n\nOther Changes:\n\nBeyond the highlights above, some other notable changes in Linux 6.17:\n\nBPF subsystem adds standard string operations\n\nBPF programs have output and error streams for userspace communication\n\nExtended attributes support for pidfds\n\nNew DAMON_STAT kernel module for simplified memory activity monitoring\n\nTCP stack now enforces receive window limits more strictly\n\nASoC adds AMD ACP7.2 platform support\n\nKernel live patch support on 64-bit ARM\n\nTurbostat utility gains L3 cache topology display\n\nFor more detail on the release as whole read through the comprehensive merge report recaps (first half & second half) put out by the folks at LWN, or sift through the thousands of kernel commits on GitHub (grab a coffee before doing that, eh).\n\nUpgrade to Linux 6.17\n\nLinux 6.17 is available for download from kernel.org as source, but you will need to compile that source code by hand to make use of it — not for the faint of heart!\n\nUbuntu 25.10 includes Linux 6.17 by default, and the release will be back-ported to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS users in early 2026.\n\nIt will not be packaged for and uploaded to Ubuntu repositories for other supported releases officially, but it is possible to make use of Canonical Mainline DEBs or third-party PPAs unofficially — not without caveats, however.\n\nInstalling newer Linux kernels on Ubuntu from outside of the main repos comes with no guarantees and no support. They may lack Ubuntu-specific patches and drivers, not work in with some hardware or lack feature integrations.",

      "headline": "Linux 6.18 To Deliver Many Notable Features For AMD CPUs",
      "content": "There is a lot coming for AMD processors with the Linux 6.18 kernel. Of the early pull requests submitted in advance of the planned Linux 6.17 kernel release later today, there are a number of changes already lined up with some exciting AMD CPU feature additions for the next kernel version. These AMD changes for Linux 6.18 are all the more important with that kernel expected to become this year's Long Term Support (LTS) kernel version.First up, the EDAC pull request was already submitted in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window. Notable here are some new Family 26 (0x1a) additions to the AMD64 EDAC driver.The AMD64 Error Detection And Correction \"EDAC\" driver for Family 26 models 0xc0 to 0xc7 and 0x50 to 0x57 are now supported. These new IDs are likely for AMD EPYC Zen 6 \"Venice\" processors. The patch confirms those models support 16 channel memory compared to 12 channels with current generation AMD EPYC processors. So the next-gen EPYC processors should now have EDAC support with Linux 6.18 and the first to support 16 channel RAM.\n\nThe same patch also adds models 0x90 to 0x9f and 0xa0 to 0xaf to Family 26 for the AMD64 EDAC driver. Those models meanwhile max out with eight memory channels. With only eight channel support, perhaps these models are for the AMD EPYC 8004 \"Siena\" successor? EPYC 8004 supports six channel memory and we haven't heard much yet about AMD EPYC 8005 series but short of being for some new Threadripper PRO parts, that would be my guess for those eight channel Zen 5/Zen 6 parts.The x86/cpu pull request for Linux 6.18 meanwhile cleans up and corrects AMD CPU topology detection. With the x86/microcode pull request from AMD's Borislav Petkov are new microcode loader additions to help in debugging CPU microcode issues.\n\nWith the x86/cache pull request for Linux 6.18 is support on AMD EPYC processors for assigning QOS bandwidth counters to resources. This is about the AMD Assignable Bandwidth Monitoring Counters \"ABMC\" support . This code has long been going through review but is now ready for the mainline kernel.The x86/apic changes also are bringing some interesting work for AMD. There is now support for runtime firmware updates for the non-x86 parts of AMD platforms like for the security processor, modules, etc.That x86 APIC pull also includes Secure AVIC support for better security and performance in helping Secure Encryption Virtualization (SEV).Meanwhile over on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine \"KVM\" side there is code now ready for SEV-SNP CipherText Hiding. This is an opt-in SEV-SNP feature to prevent unauthorized CPU accesses from reading the cipher text of SNP guest private memory. This can help prevent offline attacks against AMD VMs using SEV-SNP on EPYC processors.Via this pull is also now enabling AVIC by default on Zen 4 CPUs and newer if x2AVIC is supported. Plus there is support for Secure TSC to prevent untrusted hosts from tampering with the guest's TSC frequency. That AMD Secure TSC support is another Linux kernel feature that's taken years to bake.The Linux 6.18 merge window hasn't even officially begun yet but already there is quite a bit on the AMD processor side for this next kernel cycle. Stay tuned to Phoronix for more details as the two week Linux 6.18 merge window gets underway. Linux 6.18 stable meanwhile should be out in December.",

      "headline": "Trump’s tariff‑shaped stick can’t beat reality on US chip fabbing",
      "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

In particular, some nice performance optimizations once again for the Linux kernel.Google engineer Eric Biggers continues leading some very nice performance improvements in the cryptography space for the Linux kernel.First up is a pull request adding interleaved SHA-256 hashing support . This 2-way interleaved SHA-256 hashing is immediately used by the FS-VERITY module for faster file data verification. In turn it's been observed that FS-VERITY performance improves nicely across many Intel/AMD x86_64 and AArch64 processors. Eric Biggers reported in the patch that it's roughly 35% faster performance.\n\nAlso sent in was the FSCRYPT pull request for Linux 6.18. The focus there is on using HMAC-SHA512 library functions rather than going through crypto_shash. In turn FSCRYPT should enjoy this simpler and faster and more reliable code path.Lastly there was a pull request sent out on Saturday for crypto library updates . This pull brings RISC-V optimized code for Poly1305, simplifies other code, and always enabling architecture-optimized BLAKE2s code.",

      "headline": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): A Bull Case Theory",
      "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. on Phaetrix Investing’s Substack by Phaetrix. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMD. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s share was trading at $159.79 as of September 22nd. AMD’s trailing and forward P/E were 95.68 and 26.88 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nBenchmark Rates Canaan Inc. (CAN) as a ‘Buy’ as Bitcoin Treasury Grows\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) presents a compelling 12–18 month investment opportunity, targeting 12–18% base case returns ($168–$177) and 20–25% upside ($180–$187) if Nvidia’s execution issues persist. While markets focus on AMD’s CPU gains, the company’s transformation into a diversified GPU powerhouse is underappreciated, particularly as Nvidia faces unprecedented reliability problems.\n\nAMD’s Q2 2025 results were strong, with 32% year-over-year revenue growth to $7.7 billion, driven by gaming revenue up 73% to $1.1 billion and data center revenue up 14% to $3.2 billion, signaling successful GPU diversification. Near-term margin pressure arose from export controls on MI308 accelerators, resulting in an $800 million inventory charge, but Wall Street forecasts support a 15–20% EPS CAGR through 2027.\n\nNvidia’s structural GPU reliability failures, including melted RTX 4090 connectors and boot issues with the RTX 5090/5080 series, create a rare competitive window, positioning AMD as a stable alternative. The RX 9070 XT demonstrates strong 1440p performance and improved power efficiency, while AMD’s open-source ROCm platform strengthens its data center positioning, despite export restrictions limiting near-term revenue. CPUs continue to provide stability, contributing roughly 50% of revenue and anchoring growth in consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nAMD’s potential market share gains in the $120 billion discrete GPU segment could generate $3.6–$6 billion in incremental revenue, though Nvidia’s ecosystem dominance and limited RDNA 4 portfolio constrain high-end capture. Macro risks, including Fed rate hikes or AI capex slowdown, could pressure valuations. Nonetheless, AMD’s diversified revenue streams, competitive GPUs, and proven data center scale support multiple expansion. Key risks include Nvidia’s rapid fixes, export control tightening, and semiconductor cyclicality. Overall, AMD offers a strong risk/reward profile, with Nvidia’s vulnerabilities and AMD’s execution creating meaningful upside potential.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) by StockOpine in May 2025, which highlighted strong Q1 revenue growth driven by Data Center and Ryzen processor sales, AI demand, and EPYC market share gains. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately 39% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as AMD’s diversified CPU and GPU business supports growth. Phaetrix shares a similar view but emphasizes Nvidia’s execution issues and AMD’s opportunity to gain GPU market share.",

      "headline": "Hyte X50 PC case review",
      "content": "The Hyte X50 dares to do something different. It won't be for everyone. I'm not even sure it's for me. But I do like having the option to go bright and brave with my next PC build.\n\nPC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\n\nFrom a company that specialised in plastering its cases with anime characters, the X50 is, somehow, its most ostentatious PC case yet. Let's just say it has a look, a strong look, and one crying out for an equally flashy build within. There's more to this case than a gaudy form; it's well suited to housing a pretty powerful PC in pink. If you don't mind paying a pretty penny—okay, I'll stop now.\n\nAvailable in Snow White (white), Pitch Black (black), Wild Cherry (red), Taro Milk (purple), Strawberry Milk (pink, as reviewed), and Matcha Milk (green), it's actually a pretty tough decision to choose between them all. To make your decision all the more difficult, it also comes in two variants: with a glass side panel (X50) or without (X50 Air). Oh, and the milk options come with little round feet, while the rest feature long, flat feet—decisions, decisions.\n\nNailed at $160 in the US, the X50 is not the cheapest case around, especially for the lack of any included fans. It is a little cheaper outside of the US, however, to the tune of around $10 or the local equivalent, as Hyte is still wrestling with price disruption from tariffs. The company had largely dropped prices back to pre-tariff pricing earlier in the year, though some cases remain inflated, and the X50 is seemingly one of those affected.\n\nThe X50 Air is considerably cheaper than the X50 for its perforated side panel, to match the front and rear side, at the equivalent of $120 worldwide or $130 in the US.\n\nHyte X50 specs (Image credit: Future) Form factor: Mid-tower\n\nDimensions: 51.3 x 25.7 x 51.7\n\nMotherboard support: Up to E-ATX\n\nMax GPU length: 430 mm\n\nMax CPU cooler height: 170 mm\n\nFan support: Up to 3x 140 mm (front), up to 3x 120 mm (side), up to 3x 120 mm (bottom), up to 1x 120 mm (rear)\n\nFront IO: 2x USB 3.2 (5 Gbps) Type-A ports, 1x USB 3.2 (20 Gbps) Type-C port, audio jack\n\nStorage support: 2x 2.5-inch, 1x 3.5-inch\n\nPrice: $150 (worldwide, equivalent to), or $160 in the US; X50 Air $120 (worldwide, equivalent to), or $130 in the US\n\nThe X50 is not hugely price competitive with other similar sized chassis. The cases that Hyte has cherry-picked to compare it to include some amount of fans pre-installed, such as the Lian Li Lancool III or NZXT H7 Flow, whereas the X50 does not. So that's an added cost here. I can go one further with the cases I've personally reviewed in recent months, such as the Phanteks Eclipse G400A at $110 and Asus ProArt PA401 at $130—both good-looking cases with fans included for less—or the Corsair Frame 4000D at $95 with no fans included but a much lower price tag.\n\nYou can pick up colour-matched fans from Hyte, specifically the FA12, available in a handy four-pack for $40. I have eight of these in Strawberry Milk for testing, or $80 worth. They perform pretty great in terms of pure airflow through the rpm range, which means they're easy enough to tune to lower speeds and noise levels with a fan curve while maintaining admirable performance. You're going to want to do that, too, as they are pretty loud at top speed (which is only a tepid 1500 rpm).\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nOnto the case proper, and it's a fairly small chassis by today's standards. I measure it at 51.3 x 25.7 x 51.7 cm (H x W x L). Definitely desktop-sized if you wanted to store it in plain view atop of your desk, which seems likely with a case so bulbous and, er, I wanna say eye-catching?\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThere's a gorgeous curve to the windowed side panel on the X50, reaching from the side panel, up and over two thirds of the top of the case, stretching all the way over to the IO panel with two USB 3.2 (5 Gbps) Type-A ports and a single USB 3.2 (20 Gbps) Type-C port. This panel slides up and off—the rear panel works the same way—which keeps the exterior of the case clear of any screws. You'll want to keep a cloth close by to get rid of any fingerprints on the glass, however, as you will likely have to handle the glass to get it fitted back into place.\n\nThe front panel has a perforated finish and only gives way slightly under pressure. Altogether, it feels really solid, as does the rest of the case, thanks to some clever venting on the rear IO that Hyte calls 'Louvered Blade Ventilation'. The front panel also doubles as a dust filter, which is to say, there's no filter underneath. Dust should be collected on that outer surface, meaning it likely only needs a quick wipe down every so often, though I've not had the case for long enough to really test it out for myself.\n\nImage 1 of 8 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nThis front panel reduces airflow to the innards (with front-mounted fans) by around 0.6 m/s—which is a somewhat significant amount but not totally unusual for a case in my own testing. The same reduction applies to the rear side panel, too, which is important if you plan to stick any fans besides the motherboard.\n\nThis case has plenty of room for fans. We're spoiled for choice. There's space for up to 3x 120/140 mm fans in the front of this chassis, 3x 120 mm to the side of the motherboard, and another 3x 120 mm in the bottom. The bottom also includes a magnetic dust filter attached to the outside of the case. Then there's 1x 120 mm in the rear for exhaust.\n\nFor my test build, I opted first for what I thought would be the most beneficial layout for airflow: three intake fans in the front, three intake fans in the bottom, and one exhaust fan in the rear. Though, being such a good guy, I've also tested other likely configurations. Here are the results:\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Average temp | Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition | 1080p Row 0 - Cell 0 GPU (°C, average) CPU (°C, average) Front/bottom intake 60 66 Front intake only 62 66 Side/bottom intake 61 66 Side intake only 62 67 Bottom intake/side exhaust 61 66 Bottom intake only 60 67\n\nTest build\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X | Motherboard: Gigabyte X870 Aorus Elite WiFi 7 Ice | RAM: Crucial Pro 64 GB DDR5-6000 | SSD: Biwin X570 Pro | Graphics card: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Eagle | Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 612 Apex | PSU: Corsair RM850x\n\nAfter the sixth test with near-enough the exact same results, I called it. You can't really go too wrong here, as nearly every config landed me within a few degrees of any other. Though for a smashing appearance, I'd argue for three intake fans in the bottom, three to the side of the motherboard, and one as exhaust out the rear. It's just a shame Hyte doesn't sell reverse versions of the FA12 fans, as it'd look a lot better with all the fans facing inwards. The backside of the FA12 is pretty ugly, which is a shame for a case so prepossessing.\n\nThere's no room in the top of the case for a liquid cooler's radiator, as that's taken up by the power supply. You're better off mounting it to the side of the motherboard, which isn't too far to go for most liquid coolers in this compact case, with the fans exhausting out of the back panel.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nI can see why Hyte has chosen the top-mounted PSU here, as the case would have to be made wider to make room for one in the rear chamber or risk cutting off height to the CPU cooler, of which mine only just fits already. Though I'm not a huge fan of the end result. It feels pretty retro, which isn't out of character for the case, but it also blocks a good part of the windowed side panel and feels a little out of place above the motherboard. Maybe if the lower edge was more rounded to give a floating appearance I'd be more into it?\n\nThat said, the main issue with this approach is cable length. The Corsair RM850x PSU I'm using here has a native 12V-2x6 connector that only just reaches from the PSU, round the back of the case, through to the front, and then underneath the graphics card. And you really want this connection to be secure and, if possible, not at a weird angle. I couldn't really manage that here, due in part to the length of my cable and also the position of the PSU.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nBuy if... ✅ You can't stand a boring black box: I get it, cases can be pretty dull, and this is one way to have something that stands out without any RGB lighting.\n\nDon't buy if... ❌ You want the best value: With no fans as standard, you could save a pretty penny (there I go again) on an admittedly more boring-looking PC case.\n\nHyte includes plenty of velcro straps to tidy up cables in the rear of the case, with extras included in the box. There are no cable management channels, however, and the approach is a bit minimal compared to some modern cases. The cables are covered up with excellent colour-matched rubber grommets leading to the front-side of the case. All except the cutout below the motherboard, which looks a bit slapdash as a result.\n\nThe X50 might be cutesy and compact but it offers wide compatibility for cooling and components. In that sense, it's not form over function like some eye-catching alternatives. But it's not objectively pretty, either. I've asked around our team and it fell a bit flat, even with the members of the team that enjoy some of Hyte's weebier cases. But you might be more susceptible to its charm than any of us.\n\nThe Hyte X50 dares to do differently in a world of pretty plain boxes that let RGB lighting effects do all the heavy lifting for them. It's the antithesis of most cases today: bright, colourful, retro, and rounded. I feel like some builders will be very into it, but most won't. It could be stunning as a part of a wider themed cozy desktop, or it could look out of place alongside more serious kit. It seems to be a perfect base for modding and further personalisation, but that depends on who gets their hands on it.",

      "content": "Thirteen years after the AMD GCN 1.0 \"Southern Islands\" GPUs initially launched as the Radeon HD 7000 series, recently there has been an effort to improve the support for both GCN 1.0 and the GCN 1.1 graphics processors with their open-source Linux driver stack. This recent effort has been led by one of the developers on Valve's Linux graphics team.As noted back in July, a Valve Linux engineer has been working on big improvements for old AMD Radeon GPUs from the GCN 1.0 and GCN 1.1 generations. By default those GPUs use the older \"Radeon\" Linux kernel graphics driver rather than the newer \"AMDGPU\" kernel graphics driver used by GCN 1.2 and all newer AMD Radeon/Instinct hardware.Using the AMDGPU kernel driver is important for RADV Vulkan, various performance optimizations, and all around better support compared to the legacy Radeon driver that rarely sees any significant improvements these days. But for making GCN 1.0/1.1 more suitable for AMDGPU, Valve contractor Timur Kristóf has been working to enhance the AMDGPU DC display support for these GPUs and other fixes/adjustments.\n\n\"This series has a few minor patches to address some SI issues.\n\n\n\nWhen a 4K 60Hz display is connected to Tahiti or Pitcairn there is a slight flickering near the bottom of the display. Disabling MCLK switching fixes that. (Other SI parts are likely affected too, but I didn't test them thoroughly enough to say.)\n\n\n\nWhen enabling ASPM on Zen 4 with Tahiti and Oland, there are random hangs when the GPU usage is low. Disabling ASPM fixes that. At the moment I don't know if this is a platform-specific or GPU-specific issue and I don't think we can reasonably determine that without spending more time than we have. (Other SI parts may be affected, but I didn't test them for a long enough time to judge that.)\n\n\n\nFinally, there is a DC patch to change the minimum PLL dividers to the same value as the legacy non-DC display code. This doesn't fix any visible issue but I think it's still good to have just in case.\"\n\nSome of those patches from Timur are queued up for merging to the Linux 6.18 kernel while on Friday some additional work was posted. The new patches are to address some issues Timur observed recently with AMDGPU on GCN 1.0 Southern Islands hardware. He commented on the patch series The code is now on the mailing list awaiting review.",

      "headline": "‘Bro Completely Violated’: Seattle Woman Accidentally Backs Tesla Into Horse Trailer. Then The Car Roasts Her For It",
      "content": "Audio By Carbonatix\n\nMost cars are getting smarter. But is your car smart enough to make fun of you?\n\nTesla drivers know that every time you turn on your car, you might be greeted with a surprise. Sometimes, these surprises aren’t the best. But other times, you’ll turn on your electric vehicle and be greeted by a brand-new piece of software that can make your driving experience more enjoyable.\n\nOne update recently pushed to Tesla vehicles was the addition of the artificial intelligence chatbot Grok, a product of Elon Musk’s company xAI. One user recently shared her experience talking with the chatbot, and it didn’t go great.\n\nWhat Did This Tesla Chatbot Say To A Woman Who Just Crashed Her Car?\n\nIn a video with over 156,000 views, TikTok user Christine (@christinedalenn) shows the infotainment screen on her Tesla.\n\nShe prompts it to repeat what it last said, describing it as “rude and uncalled for.” At this point, the car goes into the following diatribe:\n\n“Night, you whiny little s—. Get some sleep, and maybe dream of a world where you don’t crash into horse trailers. This dumb b—- will be here ready to roast your a– when you wake up. Sweet f—— dreams, Tacoma style. Shove some sheep under your pillow for extra chaos. You want me to be rude again for your video? I’ll crank it up, you sensitive f—–. How about this? I’ll call you a tire-humping, [unintelligible] trailer-banging crybaby. … Record that. Post it, and let’s go viral, you Tacoma tornado. Want me to keep going, or what?”\n\nChristine responds that she’s “done” and thanks the car.\n\n“No problem, you glorious f— up. Now go record that video before you crash into another trailer in your dreams. Need me to spit more fire for the ‘gram, or you good?” the car continues.\n\nDo All Tesla Vehicles Do This?\n\nWhile many in the comments were entertained by this interaction, some wondered how it was possible—or if it was normal for Tesla vehicles to talk to their drivers in this manner.\n\nThe answer is that the Grok is currently only available in certain Tesla models, though Musk claims it will one day be rolled out to all models.\n\nAs for why Christine’s car was swearing at her, this is a feature of Grok. Tesla drivers can decide how they want Grok to speak to them. For example, there’s a “storyteller” mode that will make Grok more verbose and descriptive. There’s also an “Unhinged” mode where Grok will swear and make suggestive remarks. This is likely the mode being used by Christine.\n\nHow Do I Activate Grok In My Tesla?\n\nIf you have a Tesla and want it to swear at you, or if you’d just like an AI assistant in your car, it’s easy to use Grok in your car.\n\nFirst, you have to make sure that your car meets Grok’s current requirements. This includes having an AMD processor, running vehicle software version 2025.26 or later, and having Premium Connectivity or a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nTesla owners can enable Grok by opening the App Launcher and selecting “Grok” or by holding the voice button on their steering wheel. That said, the software is currently in beta and doesn’t control the vehicle. Existing voice commands for the vehicle still work as before.\n\nCommenters Aren’t Sure\n\nIn the comments section, users weren’t exactly sure what to make of this software.\n\n“Imagine having the worst day of your life only for your car just to rub it in your face,” wrote a user.\n\n“Don’t get a tesla. they verbally abuse you,” declared another.\n\n“Yup getting a Tesla just to argue with it,” shared a third.\n\n“This the stuff that makes me want a tesla,” offered a further TikToker.\n\nBroBible reached out to Tesla and Christine via email.",

      "headline": "Investors Heavily Search Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Here is What You Need to Know",
      "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Advanced Micro falls in, has gained 14.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAdvanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.3%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.9 indicates a change of +49.4% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.",

      "url": "https://boilingsteam.com/orange-pi-5-ultra-review/",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-23",
      "content": "Following our review of their recent RV2 RISC-V board, OrangePi has offered us to review one of their latest ARM64 based hardware, the OrangePi 5 Ultra. This is currently their highest specs ARM64 SBC.\n\nSo what can we expect from the OrangePi Pi 5 Ultra board ? Let’s go through the specs first.\n\nSpecs\n\nThe board is fairly small in size, very close to what you get with the Raspberry Pi.\n\nFeature Specifications Master Chip Rockchip RK3588 (8nm LP process) CPU • 8-core 64-bit processor\n\n• 4 Cortex-A76 and 4 Cortex-A55 with independent NEON coprocessor\n\n• Cortex-A76 at 2.4GHz, Cortex-A55 at 1.8GHz GPU • Integrated ARM Mali-G610\n\n• Built-in 3D GPU\n\n• Fully compatible with OpenGL ES1.½.0/3.2, OpenCL 2.2 and Vulkan 1.2 NPU Embedded NPU supports INT4/INT8/INT16/FP16 hybrid computing with up to 6TOPS PMU RK806-1 RAM LPDDR5 496PIN: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB optional Memory • eMMC flash socket\n\n• eMMC IC\n\n• Note: Either eMMC flash socket or eMMC IC, supports: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, 256GB optional\n\n• QSPI NOR flash: 16MB\n\n• MicroSD card slot\n\n• M.2 M-KEY slot: supports NVMe SSD (PCIe 3.0 4Lane) USB 2 × USB3.0; 2 × USB2.0 Video • 1 × HDMI 2.1 output up to 8K@60FPS\n\n• 1 × HDMI 2.0 input up to 4K@60FPS\n\n• 1 × MIPI DSI TX 4 Lane Camera • 2 × MIPI CSI 4 Lane\n\n• 1 × MIPI D-PHY RX 4 Lane Audio CODEC: ES8388\n\n• 1 × Audio 3.5mm jack with mic\n\n• 1 × MIC In\n\n• 1 × HDMI 2.1 eARC Ethernet 1 × PCIe 2.5G LAN (RTL8125BG) Wi-Fi + BT Module Onboard Wi-Fi 6E + BT 5.3/BLE module: AP6611\n\n• Wi-Fi interface: SDIO3.0\n\n• BT interface: UART/PCM Expansion Port Dual-row pin: 2.54mm 40Pin\n\n• Supports DC 5V and 3.3V power output\n\n• Configurable UART, PWM, I2C, SPI, CAN, GPIO and other functional interfaces Button 1 × MaskRom key, 1 × On/Off key Power Source Supports Type-C power supply, 5V @ 5A LED RGB LED side illumination FAN 5V 2PIN 1.25mm socket RTC 3V 2PIN 1.25mm socket Debugging Debug serial UART included in 40PIN expansion port Supported OS Orangepi OS (Droid), Orangepi OS (Arch), Orangepi OS (OH), Ubuntu, Debian, Android 13 PCB Length: 89mm, Width: 57mm, Thickness: 1.6mm Weight 60.5g\n\nThe model I received for this review was a 8 GB one. One of the key reasons to use this SBC over other versions, is that it leverages LPDDR5 memory capable of very good speeds.\n\nWhat I like about the specs is the numerous options for storage (one eMMC and another NVME M2 slot), the 2 Gigabit Ethernet port (a single one this time, so don’t expect to make it into a router), the 4 USB ports (sufficient to connect keyboard, mouse, and something else).\n\nOn paper, the specs are impressive with the fairly recent Rockchip processor. There is a NPU as well, but don’t expect to have it supported easily in Linux, even on AMD the NPU support is shaky at best. For this SBC, it involves cross-compilation, custom binaries before you can exploit a model on this board.\n\nThis is what the layout of the board looks like:\n\nHere’s the back view:\n\nNow you should be aware of the following:\n\nMobile GPUs don’t support OpenGL, only the OpenGLES subtype. You can get some Vulkan support (1.2), but as we will see later, hardware support is unfortunately not there yet.\n\nThe board is priced at around 130 USD for the 16GB version (it seems to be the main one being sold right now). Which is roughly equivalent to the Raspberry Pi 5 price for the same amount of memory. However, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra board is much more powerful in comparison, so depending on your use case, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra would represent a better value for money.\n\nOf course, the usefulness of such a board depends entirely on the quality of the software support.\n\nSoftware Support\n\nA Full Ubuntu Experience\n\nThere are many images available for this board. Ubuntu, Debian, Arch… at first I was wondering which one to go for. Even in each category you have a bunch of different images:\n\nFocal (20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version.\n\n(20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version. Jammy (22.04 LTS), desktop with GNOME or Xfce, or a server version. But it goes deeper than that. You get two different kernel available. An old 5.10 kernel or a 6.1.\n\nI went for the Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS with the 6.1 kernel, the desktop build using Xfce (GNOME was not available for that kernel).\n\nAs you can see, the Ubuntu 24.04 distro is missing from the list, and this is a shame, since this is a board released late 2024. I contacted OrangePi and they mentioned that they would eventually release a 24.04 version, but there was no clear timeline for that.\n\nTo install Ubuntu, you use dd or Balena Etcher to image a micro-SD card first, and then you get some helper scripts (using ncurses) that make it super easy to image either a eMMC chip, or a NVME drive that’s attached to the board (I don’t recommend using a micro-SD card as the main media).\n\nOnce you reach the desktop, you will see that things work pretty much as expected. Wifi, Bluetooth, and even the HDMI port could properly recognize my Ultra Wide Screen and display the full resolution. This was an issue with the RV2 board from Orange Pi (probably hardware/drivers related) but on ARM64 it seems like things are much more robust.\n\nGPU Support?\n\nSadly, but this was almost expected, there does not seem to be any kind of GPU support in the version that I have chosen. A quick check with glxgears confirms that there is just a software pipe for rendering.\n\nThis being said, the software rendering is very very fast - you can see that there’s a lot of power under the hood on the CPU side. The same glxgears was only running at 35 FPS on the RV2, here it’s 10 times faster!\n\nThere is however hope. It looks like there are efforts to mainline the GPU drivers on the Linux kernel, so when this happens you could expect a standard distro like ARMbian to offer full support of the GPU capabilities. Too early to say, but we will come back on that later.\n\nBecause of the lack of GPU support, I will be skipping the gaming aspects of this board for now. I will revisit it in another article once we have proper GPU drivers, to actually see what we can expect from this SBC once we have the Mali ready for some action.\n\nApplications\n\nI installed and tried bunch of things:\n\nChromium is installed by default and works very well, but is limited to the 110 version which is old by now. Using Flathub and Flatpak I could install a much more recent version, that has proper extensions support. Firefox works fine, too - its fork, Zen browser, also works via Flatpak but is very slow for some reason. I also tried a non-Flatpak install for Zen, but it was also slow, so it’s probably not related to Flatpak itself.\n\nThis is now a good time to talk about Flatpak. When I was reviewing the RV2 board which sports a RISC-V chip, I remarked that there are very few Flatpaks that actually support that architecture. So in effect, while flatpak is supposed to work regardless of the architecture, if you don’t have any binary built for your architecture, you won’t be able to make much use of Flathub and the like. For ARM64, the support is not 100% either, but there is a massive footprint of applications that support ARM64. I tried quite a lot of applications and I was constantly surprised wow, they even have ARM64 for that!. I surmise that this is the effect of having a mainstream ARM64 desktop machine out there running Linux with the Macbooks equipped with the M chipsets, running Asahi. (and a lot of folks who have such machines being developers themselves, of course).\n\nWhile most applications worked with the RV2 (which is roughly equivalent to a Raspberry Pi 3), it showed its limits when you wanted to do video editing for example. Kdenlive and Openshot were barely working. Here, with the OrangePi 5 Ultra, Kdenlive works like a breeze and had no issue dealing with a bit of video editing and rendering. The final video render was certainly not as fast as what you’d expect on a regular X86_64 platform, but you know, it’s workable if you are not dealing with very long videos (also, avoid 4k). We are certainly dealing with a much more capable SOC here.\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried some more professional applications like Dbeaver (for databases interactions), and it worked as expected.\n\nThe same with Memgraph (graph database), used via Docker (since they don’t have a client for ARM64, I used the web client instead). Of course, I did not try to load a massive graph database with this, but the system was very responsive and usable. Honestly, very impressive to see Memgraph running so well on a SBC.\n\nI wasted a lot of time trying to make R and Rstudio for ARM64 work togeher from the distro (without success, there was some kind of issue with the tools base package not being recognized), until I switched gears and used a Docker version of R/Rstudio instead. Once again this proved to work very well (Rstudio is a Java application so the browser IDE is basically identical).\n\nThe only appplication that did not work well was Blender. It launched, but afterwards it was a slideshow with 3 seconds between an interaction and the refresh of the screen. I assume this is because Blender requires GPU support even for its innerworkings, and since we don’t have GPU acceleration in this OS, it’s just not going to cut it.\n\nBut honestly… that’s it! Everything else I tried worked as expected on a usual desktop or laptop. At no time did I feel this is too slow, I can’t wait to stop my review - instead, if you told me that I would only have that SBC to do regular work, well, I could totally see myself living with it for 90% of my use cases.\n\nVery impressive to see this kind of performance in this form factor. And this is a board running only at 1.8 Ghz! I can only imagine how things will improve once they go to a better lithography and manage to increase the frequency of the CPU.\n\nTemperature Control\n\nThe temperature does rise a little when using all cores at once, but it remains at a manageable level. When doing some bursts of compilation the temperature rises up to about 78~80C, and when running LLMs on the CPU (full 100% CPU usage), we get up to 84, 85C.\n\nThis looks like the hard limit - I am not sure if the SBC goes into throttling then, but I did not observe higher temperature. In any cases, in all situations (apart from Blender), the system remained very responsive.\n\nPower Draw\n\nI don’t have a way to measure power draw, but according to AndroidPIMP you can expect an idle power draw between 3W and 5W, and an usage under load on average around 10W. Since the power source can produce 25W maximum, I guess you can imagine the board going up to 15W or so in spikes. In any case, its low power profile and the fact that the temperature remains well under control tells me that this is a great little machine for a server.\n\nAI - LLM Performance\n\nFor this part, I compiled both Ollama and llama.cpp and run some benchmarks on llama.cpp. I tried only smaller models, as I had low expectations that it would be running at usable speeds. The results are below, produced with the llama-bench command.\n\nmodel size params backend threads test t/s gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 pp512 23.37 ± 0.94 gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 tg128 2.49 ± 0.62 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 pp512 36.34 ± 1.78 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 tg128 5.06 ± 0.10\n\nFor dense models like Gemma 1B, it’s kind of slow and not really good for chatting. If you plan to use LLMs with this, however, MOE models like granite 3.1 3B work at a decent speed (5 tokens by second, not bad). I would certainly prefer 10 tokens by second minimum, but this is what we have to live with, at least when using the CPU mode. It’s certainly a lot more usable than the RV2 review previously.\n\nOnce we have a capable Vulkan driver working, I wonder if Vulkan can be leveraged to increase the token generation speed on this SBC. It works well on AMD configurations because they can share the overall memory with the iGPU. On ARM, I am not sure if the same flexibility exists.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe go-to suite to evaluate performance is Geekbench, because it can provide some comparison between the speed of similar tests across different architectures. Here, let’s compare it against another flagship ARM64 board, the Raspberry Pi 5 running at 2.4 ghz.\n\nSpec OrangePi 5 Ultra Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.1 Operating System Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) Processor ARM ARMv8 @ 1.80 GHz, 1 Processor, 8 Cores ARM ARMv8 @ 2.40 GHz, 1 Processor, 4 Cores” Memory 8 GB model 8 GB model\n\nSingle Core Performance\n\nBoth boards end up with a very similar performance on average in single core tests.\n\nThere are some differences, but it’s fairly marginal.\n\nMulti-core performance\n\nWhen doing multi-threaded, multi-core workflows, this is where we see the 8 processors that are available on the Orange Pi 5 Ultra shine.\n\nIts performance surpasses the Raspberry Pi 5 in almost all activities, and usually by a good 30% advantage.\n\nPerformance overview\n\nAs you can see, for parallel workloads, this board is much better than the Raspberry Pi 5.\n\nNow let’s look at the potential use of such boards as servers.\n\nServer Use\n\nYou can use this board as a server, of course. You have several distro images just for the server use, too. Docker works very nicely with this SBC, and unlike what we have seen for the RV2 and the general Risc-V ecosystem where there are very few Docker images available for that architecture, the ARM64 scene is completely different.\n\nHere, it’s almost rare to find a Docker image where there is no ARM64 build. Not surprising since ARM64 is a thing on servers nowadays - Amazon has famously pushed their own ARM Gravitron servers as an option to reduce cloud computing costs. So most companies and providers operating on the cloud pretty much need to have ARM64 builds.\n\nOn the server, you also don’t need to care as much about the lack of GPU support since you are running headless, so any distro provided by OrangePi should do: Debian, Ubuntu, or even Arch.\n\nSince this is a board that operates at low wattage and passive cooling, it’s an excellent choice if you want to build a small server for the home. For a NAS use case I would probably go for the RV2 instead since it has more storage ports, but this one could also work considering you can have an eMMC drive together with another M2 drive (NVME) at the same time.\n\nVerdict\n\nLittle boards that were previously only used for fun or small projects have come a long way. Desktop environments were rarely usable before even on the later iterations of the Raspberry Pi. Things changed a couple of years ago, and the Raspberry Pi 5 and this Orange Pi 5 Ultra fall into a category where you could actually use them as real, daily general purpose computers and not be bothered by their responsiveness, or their performance. Not only will it work well for server use, but it can do desktop work without sweating either.\n\nPrice wise, the 16 GB version is competitive. If you want similarly specced Celeron-equipped mini-PCs you would probably need a configuration with a N100 processor (that seems to be faster than the RK3588), but that is more expensive. So the value for money of this SBC seems to be pretty good at the moment, even for the 16G configuration.\n\nThe only negative points are the moment are:\n\nlack of recent distro images (Ubuntu 24.04 would be nice)\n\nlack of GPU support (potentially because I was using the 6.1 kernel?)\n\nincomplete mainline support\n\nwhich may be some killer aspects depending on your use case. The wide availability of software for ARM64 on Flatpak and Docker somewhat mitigates such issues for now.\n\nThe real solution will come when the RK3588 support will be properly mainlined. Currently only parts of it are supported but it’s not complete and bug-free from what I could read. I am following news around the Arch-based BredOS as they are actively working on bringing proper support for this chip. Once this is done, the benefits should be apparent such as:\n\nMuch better Vulkan performance (compared to proprietary driver)\n\nProper video acceleration in browsers like Chrome\n\nNo more patches to chase from one kernel to the next!\n\nOnce there are news in this regard (hopefully in 2025) I plan to revisit my review of this SBC.\n\nPractical Details\n\nIf you are interested to grab one, there are currently a few shops that sell it online:\n\nAliexpress store: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB at 220 USD (without shipping). Expensive if you are in the US.\n\nAmazon OrangePi Official: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB sells for 158 USD on Amazon.com. (without shipping) - the cheaper option.\n\nThere are probably some more third parties depending on where you are based in the world.\n\nOther valuable resources:\n\nThe OrangePi 5 Ultra Product Page\n\nThe user manual for the board\n\nThe distro page on the OrangePi website.\n\nFinal note, we have been provided with a review unit of this SBC by OrangePi themselves for this article."

      "content": "As a proud American company, Meta is committed to playing its part in ensuring the United States and its closest allies have the best tools at their disposal to defend themselves and keep their citizens safe.\n\nLast year, we began making our Llama models available to US government agencies, including those working on defense and national security applications, as well as to private sector partners supporting their work. Llama is particularly well-suited to these sensitive use cases because, as an open source platform, it can be securely downloaded and deployed without the need to transfer sensitive data through third-party AI providers. Governments can also fine-tune Llama models using their own sensitive national security data, host them in secure environments at various levels of classification, and deploy models tailored for specific purposes on-device in the field.\n\nSince late last year, we have also made Llama available for national security use cases to America’s Five Eyes security partners — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK — and their private sector partners. We are now expanding this access to a number of key US democratic allies in Europe and Asia: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, as well as NATO and European Union institutions.\n\nLlama has been used to help develop advanced AI tools for the US military and national security agencies, enhancing decision-making, mission-specific capabilities, and operational efficiency. For example, Meta is working with the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command on a pilot project to demonstrate how AI and technologies like augmented and virtual reality can help to speed routine repairs and help the Army get equipment back into the field more quickly.\n\nTo bring Llama-based solutions to these US allies, our partners include Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anduril, Ask Sage, Booz Allen, C3 AI, Circus, Cyberspatial, Databricks, EdgeRunner AI, Google Cloud, IBM, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, Snowflake, and others.\n\nWe are also supporting US national security through our work developing augmented and virtual reality technologies. Through our partnership with Anduril, we are developing a range of wearable products to help maintain America’s technological edge. This program represents the largest effort of its kind to equip US soldiers with enhanced perception and decision-making capabilities.\n\nIn a world where geopolitical power and national security are deeply intertwined with economic output, innovation, and growth, the widespread adoption of open source models like Llama will be essential to maintaining US and allied AI leadership and ensuring our shared values underpin the systems and standards adopted elsewhere. This is recognized by the US government in its AI Action Plan for America, which Meta endorses.\n\nIt is the responsibility of countries leveraging AI for national security to deploy AI ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with relevant international law and fundamental principles, principles the United States and many of its allies have committed to in the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.\n\nWe are taking a step-by-step approach to extending access to Llama for defense and national security purposes, and will consider adding further countries in the future in consultation with the US government."

The target represents about 27% upside from current levels.\n\nArya said AMD's share gains in AI and data-center markets outweigh slower trends in cyclical businesses such as consoles and embedded chips. The company's accelerated roadmap includes the MI325X entering mass production this year and the MI350 coming later in 2025, followed by a new AI server platform in 2026.\n\nThe call comes as investors digest Nvidia's $5 billion investment and product pact with Intel, a move seen as strengthening competition in data-center and PC processors. Arya argued the deal could actually benefit AMD, since both companies rely on the x86 ecosystem that AMD also licenses, making the market more robust overall.\n\nAMD stock is up more than 30% this year, though it has been volatile, trading between $76 and $187 over the past 12 months.

      "content": "The MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is, you guessed it, a dedicated AI laptop. It excels at delivering increased productivity when doing word processing, photo editing, and some 3D modelling, but as soon as I tried to do anything seriously demanding, I wished I had a laptop with a discrete GPU. Aside from performance, this is a good-looking laptop that boasts a bright and vibrant IPS display.\n\nWhy you can trust Creative Bloq Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nAnother month, another \"AI\" laptop. This time, it's the MSI Prestige A16 AI+.\n\nMSI has been relentless in its pursuit of the best AI laptop to appeal to people looking for good graphic design laptops, releasing three different models in the past 18 months alone. I’ve reviewed a number of them, from the ultra-portable Prestige 13 AI+ Evo that lacked power to the balanced Prestige 14 AI and the surprisingly capable Prestige 16 AI.\n\nThese three reviews show that the world of AI laptops is still very much hit and miss. If you're seriously into AI image generation, are running AI-powered effects in video editing, or need a finely tuned machine for 3D rendering, then you're likely to come up short. More often than not, dedicated creative workflows will still benefit from dedicated machines.\n\nSo, can the new MSI Prestige A16 AI+ finally buck the trend and deliver on its promise? Let's find out.\n\nKey specifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Specs as tested CPU: AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 365 NPU: 50 NPU TOPS (73 total AI TOPS) Graphics: AMD Radeon™ 880M Memory: 32GB LPDDR5 Storage: 1TB Screen size: 16 inches Screen type: IPS-Level Resolution: QHD+(2560x1600) Refresh rate: 165 Hz Colour gamut: 100% DCI-P3 Brightness: 400 nits Ports: 2x USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, microSD card reader, audio combo jack Wireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v5.4 Dimensions: 358 x 258.55 x 16.9 -17.35 mm Weight: 1.9 kg\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nDesign, build and display\n\n• Modern aesthetic with tapered edge\n\n• IPS-panel 100% DCI-P3 and 16:10 ratio display\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ makes a strong first impression with its minimalist silver aluminium chassis, which exudes a sleek and professional aesthetic. The base panel consists of a number of design touches that attempt to reduce any sense of bulk and clunkiness that is often associated with 16-inch laptops. These include a tapered edge, a recessed keyboard panel, and a hinge that drops the display down to desk level.\n\nThe laptop's 16-inch IPS panel might not be as superior as an OLED alternative, but it's still pretty bright and vibrant. Using it to edit photos and videos was a joy, even in a light-filled room. It also delivers an impressive level of colour accuracy as well as high levels of contrast. Additionally, the 16:10 aspect ratio provides valuable vertical screen real estate, which is excellent for video timelines and document editing.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe display also includes the professional DCI-P3 colour space with 100% coverage. This will be sufficient for most users wanting to make the most of HDR content, but if your work requires an even broader range of colours, then you'll need a display that supports either Adobe RGB or Rec. 2020.\n\nThe keyboard is relatively comfortable, although the size of the keys and distance of travel between keys is a little more than I would have liked for an optimum experience. The trackpad is central to the keyboard, which I like. However, for any task requiring precision, such as graphic design or detailed video editing, a dedicated mouse remains a necessity. The base panel also includes a fingerprint reader to the side, which allows for a quick and easy login.\n\nWeighing in at 1.9 kg (4.2 lbs), the laptop is definitely at the lighter end of the spectrum for 16-inch laptops. This makes it easy to pop in your bag and carry it with you wherever you go. Given that it could cope with some extra weight, I think MSI could have bulked out the display panel to make it less flexible. I want my laptops to be as robust as possible, and even though the base is super durable, the display panel needs more work.\n\nIn terms of external ports, MSI has opted for a pretty simple offering with two USB-Cs, a USB-A, an HDMI, a microSD card reader, and an audio combo jack. For creatives, the most valuable feature is the two Thunderbolt 4-enabled USB-C ports. These not only provide fast 40Gbps data transfer speeds for quickly moving large video and photo files but also support Power Delivery 3.0, allowing you to charge the laptop and connect high-resolution external displays simultaneously.\n\nDesign score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nFeatures\n\n• Supercharged performance thanks to AI smarts\n\n• An IPS display designed with creatives in mind\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is designed with several features specifically targeted at creative professionals and content creators. These features focus on performance, display quality, and AI-powered tools.\n\n1. AI-powered performance\n\nTo begin with, the laptop is equipped with a powerful AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor, which includes a Neural Processing Unit (NPU). More on how this performs in the dedicated performance section.\n\nThe MSI AI Engine will automatically detect what you're doing (content creation, work, entertainment, etc.) and adjust the hardware settings for optimal performance. I appreciated this, especially when I was flipping between Photoshop, Premiere Pro, SolidWorks, and other applications.\n\nAdditionally, the laptop provides access to Copilot+, Live Captions, Cocreator, and Recall. These combined provide a set of tools which will boost and enhance your productivity (if you use them wisely). Integration into dedicated creative workflows is still lacking, but if you embrace what's there already, then you'll notice some performance benefits.\n\n2. QHD+ Display\n\nMost of this was covered in the above design section, but it's worth stating that the display is specifically set up for creative professionals. The 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, 16-inch QHD+ resolution (2560 x 1600), and 165Hz refresh rate find their benefits across rendering, animation, video editing, and office applications. I found using the display an absolute joy, no matter whether I was browsing the web, doing some word processing, or getting knee-deep in video editing.\n\n3. Connectivity\n\nUSB Type-C with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility and a MicroSD card reader will help creatives to transfer files quickly and efficiently. I loved how quickly I was able to move files onto the machine, no matter whether I was dealing with MB or GB. This is a machine that can handle large files with ease.\n\nFeature score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nBenchmark scores\n\nWe test every one of our laptops using the same benchmarking software suite to give you a thorough overview of its suitability for creatives of all disciplines and levels. This includes:\n\n• Geekbench: Tests the CPU for single-core and multi-core power, and the GPU for the system's potential for gaming, image processing, or video editing. Geekbench AI tests the CPU and GPU on a variety of AI-powered and AI-boosted tasks.\n\n• Cinebench: Tests the CPU and GPU's ability to run Cinema 4D and Redshift.\n\n• UL Procyon: Uses UL Solutions' Procyon software suite to test the system's ability for AI image generation in Stable Diffusion, its Microsoft Office performance and its battery life in a looping video test.\n\n• Topaz Video AI: We use Topaz Video AI to test the system's ability to upscale video and convert video to slow-motion.\n\n• PugetBench for Creators: We use the PugetBench for Creators benchmarking suite to test the system's ability to run several key tasks in Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro, as well as its performance when encoding/transcoding video.\n\n• ON1 Resize AI: Tests the system's ability to resize 5 photos to 200% in a batch process. We take the total time taken to resize the images and divide by 5.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Header Cell - Column 1 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ GEEKBENCH 6 CPU Single-core: Row 0 - Cell 2 Row 1 - Cell 0 CPU Multi-core: Row 1 - Cell 2 Row 2 - Cell 0 GPU OpenCL: Row 2 - Cell 2 CINEBENCH 2024 CPU single-core: Row 3 - Cell 2 Row 4 - Cell 0 CPU multi-core: Row 4 - Cell 2 Row 5 - Cell 0 GPU: Row 5 - Cell 2 UL PROCYON AI Image Generation (Stable Diffusion 1.5) Row 6 - Cell 2 Row 7 - Cell 0 Office Productivity Benchmark: Row 7 - Cell 2 Row 8 - Cell 0 Battery Life Benchmark: Row 8 - Cell 2 TOPAZ VIDEO AI Enhancement: Row 9 - Cell 2 Row 10 - Cell 0 Slowmo: Row 10 - Cell 2 Row 11 - Cell 0 Combined: Row 11 - Cell 2 ON1 RESIZE 200% resize time: Row 12 - Cell 2 PUGETBENCH for PHOTOSHOP Overall: Row 13 - Cell 2 Row 14 - Cell 0 General: Row 14 - Cell 2 Row 15 - Cell 0 Filter: Row 15 - Cell 2 PUGETBENCH for DAVINCI RESOLVE Overall: Row 16 - Cell 2 Row 17 - Cell 0 GPU Effects: Row 17 - Cell 2 Row 18 - Cell 0 Fusion score: Row 18 - Cell 2 Row 19 - Cell 0 AI score: Row 19 - Cell 2 Row 20 - Cell 0 H.264 encoding: Row 20 - Cell 2\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nPerformance\n\n• Strong performance when using Adobe Photoshop\n\n• The lack of a discrete GPU means creative professionals will struggle\n\nOne of the current issues that I have with AI laptops is that they promise so much and pitch themselves as the solution to all problems. The advertising makes them sound like their AI technology will provide you with instant results, no matter the application and workflow. Maybe I'm overstating it, but it certainly feels like that to me.\n\nThat's why I was left pleasantly surprised by the Prestige A16 AI+. The lack of a discrete GPU was problematic for 3D rendering and colour grading, but the CPU and integrated GPU actually did a great job in Photoshop and Premiere Pro. The fact that it was able to handle complex video compositions and layered effects was not what I expected.\n\nAlongside photo and video editing, I also spent a lot of time browsing the web, watching videos, and carrying out general-purpose office work. The laptop served up a responsive and snappy experience in this area, which further contributed to the laptop's impressive performance.\n\nI was also impressed by the laptop's ability to perform across a broad range of applications. I think this was in part thanks to the MSI AI Engine that was adjusting hardware settings behind the scenes. It really does excel in this role, as demonstrated by its Geekbench scores. With a reasonable multi-core score, this laptop is good at multi-threading, but not to the degree of something like the ASUS ProArt P16 (2025).\n\nThe laptop's battery life, however, proved to be a significant limitation, lasting a relatively short eight hours. That means you'll either need to consign it to a permanent desk setup or be happy carrying the charger around with you. I thought I could overcome this by utilising a lightweight third-party charger, but the apparent lack of wattage meant that the system slowed to a total standstill. By way of comparison, you'll get similar battery performance on the ASUS V16 and Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.\n\nWith all this considered, the Prestige A16 AI+ is a high-performing laptop for most types of creative applications. Keep in mind, though, that if you need a laptop for more demanding graphics applications, you'll want a device with a discrete GPU.\n\nPerformance score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nPrice\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is a mid-range to high-end laptop that costs $1,399/£1,499, although there are often limited-time deals around that bring the price down considerably. If you'd prefer an OLED display with a higher resolution (UHD+ 3840x2400) then a model with that spec is also available.\n\nIn terms of comparison, you might also like the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i Gen 9, although it'll set you back at least £1,635. If you'd like something a bit more middle of the road, then the Dell XPS 16 is a great alternative, especially if you're keen on customising your own machine.\n\nValue score: 4/5\n\nWho is it for?\n\n• Content creators who don't need a discrete GPU\n\nHopefully it goes without saying, but if you're into 3D modelling, animation, rendering, high-resolution video editing, and colour grading, then you'll need a laptop with a discrete GPU. If you're creating other types of content, performing low-demand creative tasks, or needing a laptop that can boost your productivity, then the MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is well worth a look.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally MSI Prestige A16 AI+ score card Attributes Notes Rating Design: A modern aesthetic with a bright IPS display. Also perfect for portability. 4/5 Features: AI-powered performance takes centre stage, and at times it delivers, but not always. 4/5 Performance: Great for most creative projects, but the lack of a discrete GPU will be a problem for some. 4/5 Value: A relatively affordable laptop, but keep in mind it doesn't have a discrete GPU. 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou value AI-accelerated performance\n\nYou want a bright and accurate display\n\nYou need excellent portability\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou need a discrete GPU\n\nYou're only going to be web browsing"

      "content": "OBS Studio 32.0 has been released. The update sees this streaming and screen recording stable gain a nifty new plugin manager, change a few of its default settings and expand its support for NVIDIA RTX effects.\n\nThe new plugin manager is described as “basic” because it is: it shows a list of installed plugins with a checkbox to enable/disable, but ‘Browse’ and ‘Update’ options are greyed out (those options being there suggests it will be possible to find and install plugins in OBS directly).\n\nOBS Studio 3.20 increases the default bitrate from 2500 to 6000 Kbps.\n\nThe old value was decided upon a decade ago, and expectations in quality have shifted. OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.\n\nUsers with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.\n\nHybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.\n\nOn Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.\n\nOther notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:\n\nOpt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)\n\nExperimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs\n\nAudio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc\n\n--disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed\n\nPlugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded\n\nBeyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.\n\nThough a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.\n\nHow to Install OBS Studio 32.0\n\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).\n\nOn Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.\n\nThere’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).\n\nTo install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\n\nThen, install OBS Studio using apt :\n\nsudo apt install obs-studio\n\nFinally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team."

It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.\n\nThis announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.\n\nWhile an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.\n\nStill, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.\n\nNevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.\n\nEven though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "headline": "Dean of Valuation Aswath Damodaran Says He’d Rather Have His Money in Intel Than NVIDIA (NVDA)",
      "content": "We recently published These 10 Stocks are Buzzing After Important Analyst Calls. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.\n\nAswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance, often known as the “deal of valuation,” recently said in a program on CNBC that he’s still owning a stake in Nvidia, but called the stock “richly priced.” Damodaran said his Intel investment has done better than his Nvidia position.\n\n“I own half of the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) that I owned a year ago. And I’m okay with that even though it’s gone up because I think it is so richly priced that I’d rather have my money in Intel than in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). And actually my Intel investment’s done better since September of last year than my NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) investment. Yeah, Intel Intel’s caught a nice wave here.”\n\nAswath Damodaran Says He’d Rather Have His Money in Intel Than NVIDIA (NVDA)\n\nNvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.\n\nWith its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.\n\nNvidia recently impressed the market by signing an AI infrastructure deal with Intel. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel. Jensen Huang said the deal would open up $50B in TAM for both companies in the data center and PC business.\n\nAnalysts believe the deal would allow Nvidia to take market share from AMD in the data center and PC business and diversify away from Arm-based designs.\n\nMacquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) performed strongly in the quarter on renewed AI optimism and reduced concern that an individual customer or two will moderate capital expenditures. Though the Fund’s weight was among our largest positions at over 4.5% during the quarter, the relative underweight (the benchmark weight averaged 6.3%) negatively affected relative returns.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "headline": "Windows ML is Generally Available with Windows App SDK 1.8.1",
      "content": "Microsoft today announced the first stable release of Windows ML, its AI inferencing runtime for Windows 11. Windows ML (Windows Machine Learning) is optimized for inferencing on-device AI models, like those used by Copilot+ PCs, though it offers streamlined model dependency management across CPUs, GPUs and NPUs. It’s also the basis for the Windows AI Foundry, which was originally called the Windows Copilot Runtime.\n\n“The future of AI is hybrid, utilizing the respective strengths of cloud and client while harnessing every Windows device to achieve more,” Microsoft distinguished engineer Logan Iyer explains. “At Microsoft, we are reimagining what’s possible by bringing powerful AI compute directly to Windows devices, unlocking a new era of intelligence that runs where you are. With groundbreaking advancements in silicon, a modernized software stack and deep OS integration, Windows 11 is transforming into the world’s most open and capable platform for local AI.”\n\nMicrosoft first announced Windows ML (and the Windows AI Foundry) at Build 2025 this past May, so this is a pretty quick turnaround. (Compare this to the Windows Copilot Runtime, which was announced at Build 2024 and never shipped in stable.) With this release, developers can use Windows ML capabilities in production, and that tells me that there must be a new stable release of the Windows App SDK, the framework that developers use to access Windows ML. And there is: Windows App SDK 1.8.1 is now available with support for Windows 11 version 24H2 and newer. (You can download that here.)\n\nIn keeping with the nature of Windows itself, Windows ML acts as a hardware abstraction layer so that developers can target specific local AI capabilities without worrying about which hardware architectures or chipsets are available on the PCs on which their apps will run. Apps built with Windows ML will automatically download any necessary execution providers, so they don’t need to be bundled with specific (or multiple) runtimes. But developers can also create device policies to optimize their apps for low power (NPU) or high performance (GPU), or to specify the silicon used for a model.\n\n“Windows 11 has a diverse hardware ecosystem that includes AMD, Intel, NVIDIA and Qualcomm and spans the CPU, GPU and NPU. Consumers can choose from a range of Windows PCs and this variety empowers developers to create innovative local AI experiences,” Iyer continues. “Windows ML can fully leverage their latest CPUs, GPUs and NPUs for AI workloads … Leading software app developers such as Adobe, BUFFERZONE, Dot Inc., McAfee, Reincubate, Topaz Labs and Wondershare are among many others working on adopting Windows ML in their upcoming releases, accelerating the proliferation of local AI capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications.”\n\nYou can learn more about Windows ML on the Microsoft Learn website.",

Unveiled last month, the ExpertBook P3 come with with AMD Ryzen AI Pro 300 chips in both 14\" and 16\" variants with a max memory of 32GB and 1TB storage.\n\n4 Reviews ← exclude selected types\n\nThe latest notebooks from Asus are the AMD-powered siblings of the ExpertBook P3 series: the 14-inch PM3406 and 16-inch PM3606. The Taiwanese company has equipped them with Krackan Point chips and lets users choose between AMD Ryzen AI Pro 7 350 and AI Pro 5 330 processors.\n\nBoth laptops have WUXGA (1920 × 2100) anti-glare displays with a 144Hz refresh rate, backlit chiclet keys and 70 Wh battery life. Like the Intel-based versions, they work with triple band WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, and come with a bevy of ports including two USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C ports, two Type-A ports, an HDMI port and an audio jack. Asus is marketing the ExpertBook P3 for professional and enterprise settings which justifies the inclusion of a 2.5m nano Kensington lock slot.\n\nThere are some bold ruggedness claims made here. These notebooks have reportedly passed MIL-STD-810H testing, giving them what Asus calls \"military-grade durability\". Among other things, the tests include a 100mm drop while the notebook is powered on, although attempting to replicate these results on your own will conveniently void the warranty.\n\nThe PM3406 and PM3606 variants of Asus' AMD-powered ExpertBook P3 are available in only two possible configurations. The four-core AMD Ryzen AI Pro 5 330 chip comes with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and is priced at $1,149.99 for the 14-inch version or $1,179.99 for the 16-inch display. The higher-end processor (AMD Ryzen AI Pro 7 350) is paired with 32GB memory and 1TB of storage, and costs either $1,479.99 or $1,509.99, depending on the choice of display.\n\nAsus mentions in its press release that additional configurations are forthcoming in Q4 of 2025. All models are available for order on Asus' product page, with discounts on Amazon.",

      "content": "Tech Monitor recently consulted Scandinavia’s IT leaders about the practicality of deploying AI within their businesses. First stop: Copenhagen. (Photo: fantasyform / Shutterstock)\n\nThis month, Tech Monitor found itself back in the northern latitudes of Scandinavia, almost a year after it consulted the region’s IT leaders about the efficiency-creating potential of AI for their businesses. Our first stop was Copenhagen, to take stock of AI deployments throughout Denmark and to explore how companies in the country are balancing power, performance and place.\n\nWhat became clear during a lively two-hour discussion in Copenhagen’s Nimb Hotel is that maturity levels have risen. Today, most organisations are either deploying AI applications or are in the advanced stages of moving from proof of concept to rollout.\n\nThe merits of generative AI, especially when it comes to serving internal users and bringing efficiencies to internal processes, is clear. Less apparent is what AI means for the future of the workforce, coding, or the IT department itself. As a result, these existential questions – rather than the day-to-day concerns about infrastructure, compute power and the merits of cloud computing as home for AI experimentation – dominated the roundtable.\n\nAttendees at a Tech Monitor roundtable in Copenhagen, held in association with AMD. (Photo: Tech Monitor)\n\nThe end of the IT department?\n\nOne of the senior technology leaders present offered a vision of the future organisation that doesn’t include a traditional, centralised IT function. Given how GenAI is democratising software engineering, he argued that there is an opportunity to federate application development to every organisational function that requires it, from marketing to human resources and from finance to operations.\n\nNot only do these functions know best what they need (and control their own budgets), AI now allows them to build what they need, too. The net result? Devolved IT leaving the proponent of this argument not only talking himself out of a job but threatening the employment status of most people around the table, too.\n\nUnsurprisingly, not everyone was ready to accept this future vision. As another attendee pointed out, multiple departments responsible for their own development means multiple processes, multiple visions of business need, and, most likely, multiple versions of the same software tools. Another attendee put it simply: “It’s a disaster for compliance, complexity, and cost.”\n\nNot everyone thought this way, however. Some felt compliance could be centralised in this federated model and that the IT function could be reinvented as a quality assurance-led department.\n\nThe future of coding\n\nIf not the end of the IT department, what about the demise of the human coder? Most organisations represented around the table – drawn from sectors including financial services, healthcare, and retail – are currently augmenting human coders with coding co-pilots. Broadly speaking, they are automating the “grunt work,” leaving software engineers to specify needs, build requirements, and validate outcomes (though the co-pilots happen to be pretty good at validation, too).\n\nThat is the division of labour, for now at least. But what if we no longer need developers at all? That question was posed by an attendee who, like others around the table, has spent his career being taught the value of coding.\n\nDespite this, he wasn’t sentimental about its potential demise. Rather, he questioned an ongoing necessity in its manual incarnation. Another attendee compared today with Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of the movable-type printing press in the mid-15th century. For the monks whose job it had been to transcribe holy manuscripts, new technology rendered their role – but, critically, not their overall purpose – redundant.\n\nFor the tech optimist, automation opens up new opportunities. Human expertise gets deployed elsewhere, more effectively. And, to extend the comparison, in at least one telling of the arrival of the Gutenberg Press, few 15th-century scribes lamented the passing of a tedious job that took place in damp, cold conditions and increased the likelihood of poor and deteriorating eyesight.\n\nThe talent gap\n\nBeyond questions of potentially deskilling a future generation, some organisations are struggling to plug wider gaps in their AI talent pool. As one attendee put it, it’s no longer a problem for firms to figure out where AI can help. “We have 140 use cases,” they said. Rather, “it’s about figuring out how to do it”. For her, it is now a question of how to identify and prioritise talent need. Data modelling, validation and implementation are among the skills that are in short supply, she said. Legal and compliance oversight capabilities are also lacking.\n\nElsewhere, organisations are seeking to reskill their existing workforce to reflect changing requirements. One, for example, is committed to providing at least ten hours of training per employee per year. The mission: to transform the organisation so it is AI-ready. This is perhaps an example of organisations playing catch-up when it comes to artificial intelligence. Once again, the speed of the AI opportunity means organisational readiness is a long way behind the capability and availability of the technology.\n\n‘Deploying AI: Balancing Power, Performance and Place’ – a Tech Monitor / AMD executive roundtable discussion – took place on Tuesday, 16 September 2025 at the Nimb Hotel, Copenhagen, Denmark.",

      "headline": "Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options - and 3 weeks to act",
      "content": "DimaSobko/iStock/Getty Images Plus\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nZDNET's key takeaways\n\nWindows 10 support ends on Oct. 14, 2025.\n\nYou have free and paid options for extended updates.\n\nDoing nothing is not a safe option.\n\nHave you decided what to do with your old Windows 10 PCs when they reach their official end-of-support date in two weeks?\n\nThe official deadline is October 14, 2025. Microsoft is not going to back down at the last minute and offer an extension. The hardware requirements aren't going to change, either. So, if you have a laptop or desktop PC that doesn't pass the compatibility checks, Microsoft will block you from upgrading through Windows Update, and they will encourage you to buy a new PC instead.\n\nBut you have other alternatives, including some new ways to continue getting security updates for an extra year at no cost. Don't procrastinate, though -- if you're responsible for one or more Windows 10 PCs that fail Microsoft's Windows 11 compatibility tests, you need to choose one of these five options soon.\n\nAlso: How to get free Windows 10 security updates through Oct. 2026\n\nEven if you and your business aren't affected by this deadline, it's likely that you have friends and family members who own older PCs that are still perfectly functional but can't be upgraded to Windows 11. They've probably been ignoring warning messages for a few months now, but those messages are going to get more insistent as the deadline approaches. You can help them out by sending them a link to this article.\n\n1. Sign up for extended security updates\n\nMicrosoft will continue developing security updates for Windows 10, but they won't be free for everyone. Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows 10 will be available on a subscription basis for up to three years.\n\nAlso: Consumer Reports calls Microsoft 'hypocritical' for stranding millions of Windows 10 PCs\n\nHow much are these paid-for updates going to cost? That depends.\n\nConsumers have the option to receive security updates for one additional year after the end-of-support date, with the deadline pushing out to October 2026. The list price for that subscription is $30 a year, but you can cut the cost to zero by using Microsoft Rewards points earned by using the Bing search engine or the Windows Backup tool. (For details, see How to get Windows 10 extended security updates for free.) That's the obvious choice if you simply want to postpone the decision. Just be aware that the consumer ESU subscription is only good for one year. At the end of that year, you'll have an unsupported PC once again, so make sure you use that time to figure out your exit strategy for October 2026.\n\nAlso: I replaced my Microsoft account password with a passkey - and you should, too\n\nIf you're an administrator at an educational institution with a deployment of Windows 10 Education edition, you're in luck. You can purchase extended updates for up to three years, and the cost will bea mere pittance: $1 per machine for the first year, $2 for the second year, and $4 for the third and final year, taking you all the way to October 2028.\n\nIT pros who manage a fleet of business PCs aren't so lucky and will need to pay dearly to stick with Windows 10. A license for the Extended Security Updates program is sold as a per-device subscription. For the first year, the cost is $61 per PC. For year two, the price doubles, and it doubles again for year three. Do the math, and the cost is staggering: a three-year ESU subscription will cost $61 + $122 + $244, for a total of $427.\n\n2. Buy a new PC (or rent a virtual PC)\n\nMicrosoft and its partners would like you to replace that unsupported hardware with a new PC. You might even be tempted by one of the shiny new Copilot+ PCs, with their dedicated neural processing units, or maybe a powerful gaming PC. But throwing away a perfectly good computer seems wasteful, and it's not an option if you're hanging on to Windows 10 because you have mission-critical software or an expensive hardware device that's incompatible with Windows 11.\n\nAlso: I never pay full price for PCs or Macs, thanks to these 7 money-saving tricks\n\nYou also have the option to rent a new virtual PC by signing up for Windows 365, which allows you to connect remotely to your own Windows 11-powered virtual PC in Microsoft's cloud. A Windows 365 subscription works on Windows 10 and includes extended security updates for the host PC for up to three years. Windows 365 isn't cheap (plans start at $28 a month), but that option probably costs less than a new PC.\n\nFor businesses, replacing a PC that is more than six years old is absolutely the correct option. Ask your CPA about depreciation deductions.\n\n3. Upgrade your 'incompatible' hardware to Windows 11\n\nThat pesky compatibility checker might insist that you can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC to Windows 11, but there are indeed documented ways to bypass those restrictions. You just have to jump through a few technical hoops. Frankly, if you have a PC that is less than 10 years old, this is the easiest, cheapest, and most reliable option.\n\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\n\nYou can find all the details in this article: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11. Here's the short version:\n\nFor PCs originally designed for Windows 10 (basically anything designed in 2016 or later), you need to make one small registry edit and then ensure that your PC is configured to use Secure Boot with the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) enabled. Even an old TPM 1.2 chip will do. As many readers have confirmed via email, this process works seamlessly as long as you've got those configuration details set properly. This option will work even with PCs that are 10 years old.\n\nFor older PCs originally designed for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, you might need to use a third-party tool called Rufus to bypass installation challenges. That's especially true on PCs that use a legacy BIOS instead of UEFI firmware and for those that don't have access to a TPM. Make sure you have the most recent version of Rufus (version 4.9 or later) to keep up with Microsoft's latest compatibility checks.\n\nThose upgrade options can't save a device whose CPU lacks support for two specific instruction sets -- POPCNT and SSE 4.2. Most PCs built using Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will pass this test; AMD CPUs from 2015 or later should also be OK. As I note in this article, there is no workaround if you own one of those very old PCs that fail this test.\n\nAlso: How to upgrade from Windows 11 Home to Pro - without overpaying\n\nIf you do use one of these upgrade hacks, don't be alarmed by the threatening message you might see when trying to do an unsupported upgrade: \"If you proceed with installing Windows 11, your PC will no longer be supported and won't be entitled to receive updates. Damages to your PC due to lack of compatibility aren't covered under the manufacturer warranty.\"\n\nThat's deliberately misleading language from Microsoft. As I've noted before, that warning doesn't really say that Microsoft is going to cut off your access to updates; it simply says your PC is no longer supported, and you're no longer \"entitled\" to those updates. That bit of legalese is a tell on Microsoft's part, disclaiming corporate responsibility without actually saying what it will do.\n\nIf you don't want to mess with the registry and you're willing to do a clean install on a system that has a TPM but fails the CPU check, just use Rufus to create a bootable Windows 11 installation drive, which bypasses the compatibility checker completely. You'll need to restore your data files from a backup or from the cloud, and you'll also need to install your software from scratch, but that's no more difficult than setting up a new PC.\n\n4. Ditch Windows completely\n\nYou could keep your old hardware and replace Windows 10 with the flavor of Linux you prefer. If you've got the technical know-how and experience to manage the transition, that option is worth considering. Thanks to Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and a million or so web-based services, you can do just about all your basic work in a web browser these days. You might not even notice what operating system is running that browser.\n\nAlso: Yes, you can run Windows apps on Linux - here are my top 5 ways\n\nSwitching to Google's free ChromeOS Flex might also be possible, although the compatibility requirements for that alternative are just as likely to get in your way. I wrote about my experience here: Installing ChromeOS Flex? 5 things you need to do first to avoid headaches. As I pointed out, \"If you've got an old PC or Mac and you're thinking of installing ChromeOS Flex on it, don't do anything until you check Google's official ChromeOS Flex certified models list.\"\n\nPay special attention to the end-of-support date for the PC you're thinking of upgrading. It doesn't make much sense to replace Windows 10 with a release of ChromeOS Flex that's also set to end support in the next year.\n\nAlso: 7 most Windows-like Linux distros - if you're ready to ditch Microsoft\n\nSwitching to Linux or some derivative of Linux might be a good way to repurpose an old PC. For consumers and businesses with existing investments in Windows software, it might not be a realistic alternative, but it's worth considering.\n\n5. Ignore the end-of-support deadline completely\n\nYou could do nothing at all -- just continue running your unsupported operating system and hope for the best. That's a bad idea that exposes you to the very real possibility that you'll fall prey to a security exploit. Unfortunately, a lot of people are going to do just that. Some percentage of them will end up regretting their decision.\n\nI've heard from some folks who believe that being extra careful and using third-party antivirus software will protect them from harm. I wouldn't bet my business on that strategy.\n\nAlso: Stop paying for antivirus software. Here's why you don't need it\n\nIf you're intent on doing so, consider installing the third-party 0patch agent to deal with any security issues that aren't addressed by Microsoft. The free 0patch personal plan includes patches for known 0-day vulnerabilities, but if you want all Windows 10 patches, or if the PC is used for business or enterprise tasks, you'll need to pay for a 0patch Pro plan at a per-PC rate of €24.95 per year -- for customers in the US, at current exchange rates, that equates to less than $2.50 a month.\n\nI wouldn't recommend that for a PC that you use for business, but if you have a device you use for casual tasks at home, you might be willing to take the risk.\n\nWhat does 'end of support' mean?\n\nFor nearly a quarter-century, Microsoft has had a formal policy of supporting each major operating system release for 10 years. Windows 10 was released in 2015, so its 10 years are up, as expected, in 2025.\n\nThe end date is right there on the Microsoft Support document that lists products retiring or reaching the end of support in 2025. Every retail edition of Windows, as well as the Enterprise and Education editions, is slated for retirement.\n\nIf you have a Windows 10 PC, it faces mandatory retirement in 2025 Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nThat schedule is defined by Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy, which is documented on the Microsoft Lifecycle page: \"Windows 10 will reach end of support on Oct. 14, 2025. The current version, 22H2, will be the final version of Windows 10, and all editions will remain in support with monthly security update releases through that date.\" In a separate support article, Microsoft reiterates that as of Oct. 14, 2025, it will no longer provide technical support or security and reliability fixes for PCs running Windows 10.\n\nAlso: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for free\n\nWhen a Windows version reaches its end-of-support date, the software keeps working, but Windows Update stops delivering security and reliability fixes:\n\n[There] will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service. Paid programs may be available for applicable products.\n\nThat part in the middle sounds encouraging, doesn't it? \"Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.\" Unfortunately, that's not a supported option for customers running Windows 10 on hardware that doesn't meet the stringent hardware compatibility requirements of Windows 11. If you try to upgrade one of those PCs to Windows 11, you'll encounter an error message.\n\nAnd then you'll have to choose one of the five options above.",

      "headline": "Talk Python to Me: #520: pyx - the other side of the uv coin (announcing pyx)",
      "content": "pyx brings Python packaging closer to fast, predictable, and boring by pairing a smart server with the smart clients many of us already use. If PyPI is the public square, pyx is your team’s front desk: it mirrors the world, applies your rules, and keeps installs humming from everyday web apps to CUDA-heavy ML stacks. The result is less friction, more reliability, and a packaging flow that respects your time.\n\nHere are resources to go deeper on the themes from this episode, from beginner Python to modern packaging and ML installs. Course links include a tracking parameter so we know these came from the podcast.\n\n\"The biggest PyTorch wheels are like almost three gigs, I think.\" -- Charlie Marsh\n\n\"You also don't have to use pyx to use uv obviously.\" -- Charlie Marsh\n\nAstral’s ecosystem context: Ruff, uv, and pyx pyx joins Ruff and uv to form a coherent toolchain focused on performance and reliability for Python at scale. The blog history shows steady investment across these tools.\n\nFits existing publishing and packaging flows Package authors can keep building wheels and sdists, push via Twine, and follow the canonical PyPA guidance. Ops teams can layer promotion and retention policies in the registry rather than bespoke scripts.\n\nRelease philosophy: conservative about dates, quality first Astral avoids promising dates publicly to keep quality high and reduce pressure on shipping. In the episode, Charlie describes this as a deliberate policy to prevent over-promising. (From the transcript.)\n\nNot a PyPI replacement, but a complement PyPI remains the public commons; pyx is an organization’s front door. Mirror the world, host private packages, and apply your rules without breaking compatibility with standard clients.\n\nWhy this matters to app devs and data scientists App teams get faster CI and fewer resolution surprises; data scientists get correct CUDA-matched wheels and less time fighting install matrices. The result is more time building and less time debugging environments.\n\nSecurity and supply-chain posture improves with mirroring and policy A controlled mirror helps you react to supply-chain issues and reduce exposure to typosquatting or account-takeover campaigns that target public indexes. This builds on PyPI’s ongoing security initiatives.\n\nGPU-aware installs target real ML pain points Installing GPU stacks is tricky because CUDA versions, OS, Python versions, and large binary wheels must align. pyx focuses on making the PyTorch path smoother by serving the right artifacts for your environment and avoiding unnecessary rebuilds.\n\nCentralized policy and composition give orgs control Rather than scattering config across developer machines, pyx lets teams set server-side rules: prefer internal packages, mirror from PyPI, and control what gets promoted or blocked. That turns the registry into a system of record for your Python artifacts.\n\nSmart client + smart server is the design pattern Uv is already fast at resolving and installing; pairing it with a registry that understands Python packaging details reduces edge cases and enables new optimizations. This is the \"meet in the middle\" model adopted by mature ecosystems.\n\nWorks with pip, uv, and standard publishing tools pyx speaks the same registry protocols, so you can install with pip or uv and continue publishing with Twine . Using uv with pyx can unlock additional fast paths, but it is not required. (Stated in the episode and aligned with docs.)\n\npyx is a Python-native package registry that mirrors PyPI and adds team-friendly controls pyx runs on the server side and mirrors PyPI while exposing Python-focused features for speed and reliability. It slots into existing workflows so teams can keep using familiar tools while gaining predictability and performance.\n\nIf package installs have felt slow or flaky, this episode explains why and how smarter tooling fixes it. You’ll hear how registries (servers like PyPI or pyx) and clients (tools like pip or uv) cooperate, why wheels are faster to install than building from source, and why GPU-heavy stacks like PyTorch complicate versioning and artifact selection. Skim the PyPI overview and PyTorch’s install matrix to follow along: pypi.org and pytorch.org/get-started/locally .\n\nCharlie Marsh is the founder and CEO of Astral, the team behind Ruff (a fast Python linter and formatter) and uv (a high-performance Python package manager). In this episode he announces pyx , Astral’s Python-native package registry, and explains how it complements PyPI and today’s tooling to make installs faster and more predictable.\n\nCollapse transcript\n\n00:00 A couple years ago, Charlie Marsh lit a fire under Python tooling with Ruff and then uv.\n\n00:05 Today, he's back with something on the other side of that coin, pyx. pyx isn't a PyPI replacement.\n\n00:13 Think server, not just index. It mirrors PyPI, plays fine with pip or uv, and aims at making installs faster and predictable by letting a smart client talk to a smart server. When the client and server understand each other like uv and pyx do, you get new fast paths, fewer edge cases, and the kind of reliability teams beg for. If your Python packaging has felt like friction, this conversation is traction.

Visit talkpython.fm/sixfeetup. Charlie, welcome back to Talk Python.\n\n01:55 It's awesome to have you here. I'm glad to be back. It's always a pleasure.\n\n01:58 Yes, it is. I want to say, ty, thank you for you to come back. How about that? Last time you were\n\n02:03 here, we talked about ty with you and Carl Meyer, right? That was fun. Yes. And we're hard at work.\n\n02:08 I mean, I get asked basically every day, but we're hard at work working towards the beta release, which will be soon. We have a date for it internally, but we tend to have a policy of not\n\n02:18 sharing deadlines externally. Let us all take AI, that is Apple intelligence, as a deep lesson in corporate history for not getting out over the skis and not releasing.\n\n02:30 I mean, they were running like suites of ads about all the feature for Apple intelligence before even the features existed.\n\n02:37 And then they had to cancel them, which is a little hard.\n\n02:39 So no, I'm here for you.\n\n02:41 I'm here with it.\n\n02:41 Yeah, I think for us, it's like we put enough pressure on ourselves to get it out.\n\n02:45 So we don't need the external pressure to get it out.\n\n02:49 But yeah, we do have a deadline set and we're working hard towards it.\n\n02:51 A lot of this stuff does happen in GitHub.\n\n02:54 So there's ability to like peek over the fence and see what's happening at least, right?\n\n02:57 Yes, if you closely watch our GitHub, Nothing is like ever a surprise.\n\n03:01 Except for that it is a surprise.\n\n03:02 Like Red Knot kind of snuck in there.\n\n03:04 That was the original name for ty.\n\n03:06 Yeah.\n\n03:06 Yeah, exactly.\n\n03:07 Up until the day that we did your podcast.\n\n03:09 Yes, that's right.\n\n03:10 That was awesome.\n\n03:11 I think that was literally the day that we changed the name for Red Knot to ty.\n\n03:14 And I had to tell you, hey, this is what it's going to be done.\n\n03:17 Yeah, I was scrambling like, oh, I got to change my notes.\n\n03:19 Like this morning it's renamed.\n\n03:21 Okay.\n\n03:22 I had to change the title in like the YouTube stream and all that.\n\n03:25 That's right.\n\n03:26 Well, it ended up being a good forcing function for us because we were basically like, Okay, we have to choose a public name by the time we do the Talk Python show.\n\n03:34 I love it. I love it.\n\n03:35 Because we don't want to go on and use the code name.\n\n03:36 Exactly. It's just too hard to find and replace an audio.\n\n03:39 Okay, well, that was really cool.\n\n03:42 I think maybe give us the elevator pitch on Charlie Marsh and Astral.\n\n03:46 Just who are you? I know most people know you from various ways, but at the same time, there's plenty of listeners who don't.\n\n03:51 Yeah, totally. So my name is Charlie. I'm the founder and CEO of Astral.\n\n03:56 we build what we call high performance python tooling so we built a couple of different tools you might be familiar with some or all or none of them the first tool we built was called rough it's a python linter a code formatter and it does a lot of code transformation so it tries to like find issues and fix them for you then we built uv which is our python package manager also manages like your python tool chain everything like that it's kind of meant to be you install it and it hopefully takes care of all your packaging and running Python problems. We're also building a tool called ty, which Michael just mentioned, which is our type checker and language server.\n\n04:30 It's kind of like an alternative to like mypy, Pyright, also PyLance. So you can use it to check your Python types, all that kind of stuff. I've been working on this stuff for about two and a half, three years. So we try to build Python tooling that hopefully solves a lot of the user experience problems I think that people have when they get started with Python, but also tries to\n\n04:49 scale to very large projects. Yeah, it's really interesting. I don't know if people necessarily believed that we had a Python tooling problem. I know they thought we had a packaging problem in the sense that why does Conda and Anaconda exist at all? It's because there were platforms where you basically could not, or it would be very difficult to install a thing, right? Like, oh, do you not have the Fortran compiler? Oh, you do have the Fortran compiler, but it's the new one, not the old. It's like, are you serious? This is the thing I need, But, you know, sometimes there's just weird edge cases.\n\n05:22 So I know people knew they had that, but I don't know they necessarily felt they had a performance problem until they saw Ruff and uv and they're like, oh, okay, that's different.\n\n05:31 What's the reaction been?\n\n05:32 I was a little bit wondering about that question too when I like started working on Ruff, because when I started working on Ruff, I mean, I felt like there was a little bit of a performance problem because I had tried to work on some large projects and they'd struggled a little bit.\n\n05:45 And when I released Ruff, I kind of wanted to see like, well, if things are way faster, would people really care? And so I think it's turned out that if I'd asked people at the time if they cared a lot about a faster linter, I think a lot of people would have probably discouraged me from investing a lot of time into that.\n\n06:00 It's never going to go anywhere. This will never amount to nothing.\n\n06:03 But since then, that's one of the reasons I started working on this stuff full-time is because the interest was just... The adoption was just so fast. And I think a lot of it is with performance, you kind of don't realize that things can be really different until you've experienced it.\n\n06:16 Like with uv now, you can install things much, much faster. And if you go back to a different tool, it can be a little bit jarring to be like, oh, wow, that's really different. So it turns out that people actually really, if you can give them a tool that you hope is, one of the things that we look to do a lot was like, we want this to be kind of as close to a drop-in replacement as we can, but also solve some more problems. And so it was like, if we give you a tool that we think is kind of a drop-in replacement, but it's also way faster, the value proposition was really strong.\n\n06:43 people are like, well, why wouldn't I use this? I've started adding rough commands to just places that they wouldn't normally exist. Like for normal linting type of operations, like in all of my editors that I work with, like the save or format document is just run ruff on that. I have a permanent rules file for when I'm doing agentic coding that says anything that you touch, run ruff format and rough check dash fix on it. Yeah, me too. And it's like, yeah, that was like one of\n\n07:16 the cool things for me was like, it can really change how you use the tool. Like you can run it on a keystroke. Whereas before it was like some expensive heavy step that had to paralyze across all your, like maybe made your machine take off a little bit and like could only run in CI, stuff like that. So yeah, that's been a big part of what we want to try and do.\n\n07:33 Yeah. Instead of being something you've got to choose, I'm going to take a moment and do this.\n\n07:36 It's just so fast that it can just happen automatically on like file save or on get commit or whatever.\n\n07:43 I think that we've learned over time is that the stuff that we're working on, it's not just about performance.\n\n07:49 Like I think performance is a great, it's a, anything we build, we want it to be extremely fast and ideally a lot faster than anything else out there.\n\n07:56 But we're also trying to solve kind of like other problems.\n\n07:58 And I think uv is like a good example of that where yes, performance is a big part of it.\n\n08:03 But I think we also have a lot of users where like the performance doesn't really matter.\n\n08:07 And what they actually care about is the like the overall experience that we're trying to deliver, which is like you install the thing.\n\n08:14 It installs Python for you.\n\n08:15 It manages the virtual environment abstraction for you.\n\n08:18 It does all these things for you.\n\n08:19 And you don't really have to like think and worry about like trying to make a bunch of problems go away.\n\n08:23 Sure.\n\n08:23 And I think you've done that super well.\n\n08:24 I remember when we first talked about uv three episodes ago, maybe before you had come up with the uv lock concept and the package.\n\n08:35 It was the uv pip CLI, yeah.\n\n08:36 Yeah, exactly.\n\n08:37 There was a lot of pushback from people like, why are you not just doing uv install package?\n\n08:44 There's like this uv pip install package.\n\n08:46 And you and I at the time spoke about how you wanted to save space, like room in the namespace for future work.\n\n08:54 I think that came out well, don't you?\n\n08:55 I'm really happy with how it played out.\n\n08:57 There was a period of time where I almost folded because like when we came out was uv pip install. Everyone was like, can we please not write the pip? Can you just make it uv install? And yeah, the whole thing for us was like, we were saying, well, yeah, but we want uv install. I ended up being, we used the name uv sink, but we were like, we want like a very different CLI, like a totally different experience. And so that's why we're doing that. And at the time when we launched with just the uv pip stuff, I mean, that actually grew quite a lot even before we launched the uv sink like that. And it's still like a fully supported, like first class thing in the in uv but when we came out with that yeah there was a period of time where i was like hey maybe we should consider like getting rid of this because people keep complaining about it but we because we do listen we listen when people have feedback we listen when people yeah of course have criticism but we stuck to it and i think ultimately that was the right decision yeah i do too yeah it just meant that we i think things became clearer too once we launched like that other set of apis like uv sync uv run uv lock because then there was like some contrast And it is still a lot to explain, but we're trying to do a hard thing of like both supporting like all these existing workflows, this huge existing ecosystem and innovate on top of it.\n\n10:05 Sure.\n\n10:06 Yeah.\n\n10:06 We kind of try to support those two worlds and I think we made good decisions there, but yeah, it is.\n\n10:11 I'm glad we stuck to it.\n\n10:12 Very good.\n\n10:13 To me, I was kind of like, I don't get the drama because I don't type any of that stuff anyway.\n\n10:19 I have aliases that are way shorter that used to do stuff with pip.\n\n10:24 So I edited my RC file and I put a uv space in front of the commands.\n\n10:27 I'm like, okay, well, that transformation is done.\n\n10:29 We're good to go.\n\n10:30 You know what I mean?\n\n10:31 That was the goal.\n\n10:32 Yeah.\n\n10:33 So for me, I actually feel like it kept it pretty straightforward.\n\n10:36 But yeah, there was...\n\n10:37 But once you came out with the sync concept, the uv tool, maybe riff a little bit on uv tool before we get into pyx and stuff too much, because I think that's actually a bit of a hidden gem.\n\n10:48 And I'll say why, but I want you to riff on it first.\n\n10:49 Tell people about the tool and the script running sort of aspect that maybe is less\n\n10:54 then. uv tool is this, you know, we think of a tool as like an executable application that you can install. So like often, right, when you're using Python, you're like working on a project and you install a bunch of libraries that you need to import. But, you know, there's also a very different way of like installing and using Python packages, which is a lot of packages are just executables. So like when youinstall ruff as a Python package, it's actually really just like a binary that you like unpack and run. When you run uv tool,install ruff, like we just basically install that executable and like make it available on your path. The nice thing about uv tool is like, there are lots of applications and tools that you can install. Like just, you just run like uv tool install or whatever, and then like black or rough or my pie or whatever gets added to your path and you can use it. And we also have this alias uvx. So you can do like uvx rough check.\n\n11:44 That's actually like typically what I use, which is an alias for like install this tool and run it.\n\n11:49 So if you just run like uvx rough check, it will install and run ruff.\n\n11:54 Or if it's already installed, obviously just execute it.\n\n11:56 So like for me, when I'm just like trying to execute random Python tools, a lot of the time I'm just going through uv and it abstracts away this idea of like, have I installed the thing?\n\n12:06 What version did I install?\n\n12:07 Like, where is it?\n\n12:07 All of that.\n\n12:08 It's super nice.\n\n12:09 And the hidden gem part of it, I think, as you talked about an executable, certainly with Rust, that is 100% true.\n\n12:15 I think something that's really interesting is if there's an entry point in the package, or I think it's a scripts declaration in the PyProject.toml, which says this command maps to this function, which might take command line arguments or something, and you uvtool install that package, those become just machine-wide commands that you just have.\n\n12:37 And so I think the reason I think that's so powerful is we've traditionally had a really hard time shipping just machine-wide installed tooling for Python people or anything, as long as they're willing to run the command to install it.\n\n12:50 Because that used to be, well, okay, here's what you're going to, just follow me now.\n\n12:53 What you're going to do, you're going to create a virtual environment, but then you're going to put part of it in the path.\n\n12:57 And then you're going to activate it.\n\n12:58 You're going to pip install that thing.\n\n13:00 And then once you go in there, you'll be able to run this command long as it's active because you don't want to mess up the system Python.\n\n13:05 No, no.\n\n13:06 And it was just like, whoa, all right, well, let's not do that.\n\n13:08 That's a hassle.\n\n13:08 But now if you can just uv tool install, you name it, and it works, well, then all of a sudden, that's a real viable way to ship tooling globally to anyone, even if they don't know anything about Python.\n\n13:19 And we actually see that with a lot of companies that we talk to.\n\n13:22 It's like uv becomes the easiest way for them to actually distribute and run small tools.\n\n13:26 And it's cool because like a lot of things in uv, a lot of this is basically enabled by standards.\n\n13:31 And it's like us just trying to make things that are enabled by standards, like a little more like accessible or like easy to use. Like that idea of defining scripts in your PyProject Toml is just like a standardized concept. And it's just us, we install the thing and we kind of create those little entry points, which are basically Python scripts that run the function.\n\n13:48 Similarly, like a lot of people, I mean, me included like the, these like standalone Python scripts. I don't know if you use those at all, where you have the metadata in the header. So you can have a single file script that says like, I depend on these things. And if you uv run that script, we'll install the packages into like this isolated environment and run the script in that environment. And that too is like, that's not even something that we invented. That's like a standard that, that was put forward. I think it's PEP 723. And again, it's take those standards and those like good ideas and just try to find ways to make them like ergonomic and accessible to people.\n\n14:21 So I don't know. It's something I reflected on a lot, which is like, I don't think those aren't even necessarily great examples of this, but like, it's not actually clear to me that we could really build uv like a few years ago because so much stuff got standardized. Like things that people, things that most users probably don't really think much about, like build backends and like build isolation. And there's just a lot of things that were basically came up organically in packaging and then got standardized. And now that they're standardized, we could actually build a tool that like does all the stuff. And it's not just, it's not like pip is the only tool that can be an installer. Like anyone could build an installer because so much of this has been standardized.\n\n14:59 Yeah, Franklin out of the audience says, uv tool install plus brew install equals heaven.\n\n15:03 Yes, indeed.\n\n15:04 Oh, nice.\n\n15:05 It's definitely good stuff.\n\n15:07 This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Six Feet Up.\n\n15:10 Let me ask you a question.\n\n15:12 What's stopping you?\n\n15:13 Maybe it's an application that won't scale or an AI initiative that just isn't delivering.\n\n15:18 That's where Six Feet Up comes in.\n\n15:20 With deep expertise in Python and AI, they solve hard software problems, modernize platforms, and get teams to market faster.\n\n15:29 These folks have been doing Python since version one.\n\n15:32 They know the frameworks and ecosystems like the back of their hands.\n\n15:35 Six Feet Up's impact speaks for itself.\n\n15:38 Automated healthcare pipelines for hospitals, helping NASA explore Pluto, building severe weather prediction tools, and applying AI to connect farmers with vital crop data.\n\n15:48 When the stakes are high and the problems are hard, Six Feet Up is the partner that delivers.\n\n15:53 See what's possible with Six Feet Up.\n\n15:55 Visit talkpython.fm/sixfeetup.\n\n15:58 the link is on the episode page and in your podcast player show notes thanks to six feet up for sponsoring the show i think people got a sense for uv i do want to actually let's talk about one one thing i was just talking to some folks this morning and they're like hey uv python upgrade awesome new feature oh yeah and i said i have no idea what you're talking about they said it's a new feature of uv i'm like okay after this media i'm gonna go check it out but then i didn't so you\n\n16:21 have to tell me about it what is this is brand new stuff right i mean it kind of does what it sounds like, which is it lets you upgrade Python. It sounds really straightforward, but here's the\n\n16:29 thing. I have, if I go look, if I go run uv tool list, I've got, I don't know, more than a page worth of things. And some of them are super minor, but I've got things like just path, which is a cool thing that shows you stuff that you put in your path that might still be lingering in your path settings, however they come about in the environment, but those folders don't exist anymore.\n\n16:49 So, hey, these are errors. Maybe you should like clean up your path settings a little bit. They're if that gets, if I don't run that very often, like, but it's around, but I have PLS. Are you familiar with PLS? The, instead of LS, the pretty LS? No, I probably, sounds like I should be.\n\n17:07 Oh my God. It's so beautiful. So when you do LS, it will use like the nerd font. So you have to have a nerd font at nerdfonts.com. I think it is nerd font for your terminal. But then like, if there's a Python file, I have a Python logo next to it. And if there's a GitHub, a Git ignore, it'll have like a GitHub logo.\n\n17:25 And it does things like looks at the Git ignore and determines which hidden files to show actually and which hidden files to actually hide or other stuff.\n\n17:32 So like your Git ignore will appear even though it's a regular LS and.vnv will appear and it has like a, anyway, nice.\n\n17:39 If that thing goes wrong, LS stops working on my system.\n\n17:41 And I got to go like a stone man going around typing slash bin slash LS until I can fix the virtual environment.\n\n17:47 So if I like remove the Python that uv installed when I said tool install that thing and I want a newer one.\n\n17:55 And then I try to run it.\n\n17:56 It's like, well, the Python is gone.\n\n17:57 Ah, right.\n\n17:58 Is this uv Python upgrade related to that or is it unrelated to this?\n\n18:02 I was just trying to look at the documentation because I'm trying to remind myself.\n\n18:07 I'm trying to remind myself what's in preview and what's not.\n\n18:09 Yeah, sure.\n\n18:10 We have like a preview mode, which lets you like opt into newer features.\n\n18:16 And one of the things that we wanted to solve with uv Python upgrade and with Python installs in general is basically this, which is when you create like an executable script, you have to put the path to the Python interpreter in the header, like literally the path to it goes in the file.\n\n18:29 So if that path contains like the patch version of Python, like 3.13.0, and then you upgrade your machine to like 3.13.1, suddenly those scripts can break because they point to interpreters that no longer exist.\n\n18:42 So we implemented, again, I don't remember off the top of my head if it's in preview or not, but we implemented a solution to this, which is we basically do some like kind of fancy sim linking stuff so like we have a sim link that's like 3.13 that like points to 3.13.1 and like we read the sim link to those files so if you upgrade\n\n19:01 from 3.13.0 to 3.13.1 we upgrade the sim link and the files i see everything else is transparent because there's like two sim links so you got that level of abstraction to swap it out with right yeah\n\n19:12 i think we took this from homebrew i think homebrew actually does it this way which is they create It's kind of like a sim link for the minor version, like 3.13.\n\n19:19 And then that points to the specific patch version.\n\n19:21 And so when we upgrade the patch version, we also update the sim link.\n\n19:24 And then everything else kind of just works.\n\n19:26 But I can't remember if this is only if you pass preview.\n\n19:30 You all are shipping fast.\n\n19:31 By the time most people hear this, probably it'll be.\n\n19:34 By the time people are here, it won't be in preview, yeah.\n\n19:36 Exactly, yeah.\n\n19:38 I use uv tool install all the time.\n\n19:39 I really love it.\n\n19:41 A lot of neat tools there.\n\n19:42 I think it's the stealth secret way of like, you now have ways of installing CLI apps that are just published at PyPI and a single line to go.\n\n19:51 And that doesn't quite give us full GUIs and things that go into the docs with icons and stuff.\n\n19:56 But that's okay.\n\n19:56 It's definitely a positive step in the right direction.\n\n19:59 We're also trying to make that like Python upgrade experience a lot better.\n\n20:02 So I'm glad that you were told about it and that we had a second to shout about it.\n\n20:06 Like, how am I missing all this hype?\n\n20:07 What have I missed?\n\n20:08 Exactly.\n\n20:09 It's super good.\n\n20:10 It's super good.\n\n20:10 Okay.\n\n20:11 So let's talk about the next step in Python packaging.\n\n20:15 What is this pyx?\n\n20:16 And so I think the first thing I would like you to go on record for people, because I still to this day have debates with people, whether it's...\n\n20:23 How to pronounce it?\n\n20:24 Yes.\n\n20:25 People are like, yeah, I got it from PyPy.\n\n20:27 I'm like, yeah.\n\n20:29 And I'll say PyPy.\n\n20:29 And they're like, you're saying it wrong, Michael.\n\n20:31 I'm like, maybe, but everyone who works on it says it the same way.\n\n20:34 So I think I might be saying it the right way.\n\n20:36 Yeah.\n\n20:36 Let's get the pronunciation good.\n\n20:38 It's kind of funny because like we basically have this problem with like all of our tools.\n\n20:41 And it's like very common advice that like when naming things, they shouldn't be like ambiguously pronounced.\n\n20:46 And we've kind of just ignored it.\n\n20:49 So like, like ty is the same.\n\n20:51 People call it like some people call it Ty, right?\n\n20:54 I don't know what you call it.\n\n20:55 I call it ty.\n\n20:55 I call it ty as well.\n\n20:56 I mean, because you called it ty.\n\n20:58 Right.\n\n20:58 In general for us, it's always the initialization.\n\n21:01 So like uv.\n\n21:02 I love R-U-F-F.\n\n21:03 No, just kidding.\n\n21:04 Yeah.\n\n21:04 Okay.\n\n21:05 Ruff is the one exception.\n\n21:06 That's because I created Ruff before we started the company and before we had any of these patterns. Like I didn't really know what it was going to be. Of course. And we talked about that\n\n21:13 on the show. We talked about that on the show. First time I had you on was about rough before\n\n21:17 you started Astral, I believe. Yeah. So it's uv, ty, and then here it's pyx.\n\n21:22 When I have some kind of AI read it back to me, because a lot of times I'll have a lot of stuff to read and I'm like, oh, let me throw it into some kind of like text to speech thing so I can listen while I'm driving and then I'll be able to talk. And it's like, oh yeah, of is amazing. I'm\n\n21:40 And this is our kind of our first hosted infrastructure product. So it's a big, I guess I would say expansion for us in terms of problems we're trying to solve. Historically, everything we've built so far has been focused on command line tooling, like rough UVTY. These are tools that you install, they run in your terminal. They're kind of, they just run on the client. And this for us is the first thing that has a server. It is a live thing that we run as a service for companies. And it's sort of the counterpart to uv in some ways. So like uv is the client in that sense, pyx is the server. pyx is our package registry, also does a lot of other things, but ultimately it's kind of like a backend that accompanies uv and lets us solve a bunch of problems that otherwise we were kind of limited from solving in the past. I think a lot of the motivation for actually building this and the specific features that we're working on, et cetera, they basically come from like the uv issue tracker. It's like talking to users, hearing about their problems and being like, well, we actually can't really solve that for you because like that's the responsibility of the server and we're just the client. And QIX is in a lot of ways our response to that being like, well, but if we had a server, then we actually could solve that problem. Maybe we could solve like all these other problems. And so for me, it was kind of a natural evolution of what we were already doing with uv was to say, well, if we have all these users who have all these problems that we think we can solve or hope we can solve by building our own server, then we should do that. And because it's a server, because we have to run the server and we have to serve packages, we can charge money for it. And because it's a product that competes in a space of things that people already pay money for, we can charge money for it. And that will be the first thing that we basically charge money for and try to build our business around,\n\n23:22 which is this package register. Definitely wanting to talk about the business model.\n\n23:25 I think that's a really important thing. Yeah, of course.\n\n23:27 But before we get to it, let's think of some of the problems that might be solvable on the server, but not solvable.\n\n23:34 Because uv has certainly made a dramatic splash in how many people are using it just out of nowhere, which is really impressive.\n\n23:41 That, count me among them, that really is really an awesome tool.\n\n23:45 But maybe, let me throw out some ideas and you can tell me if I'm on or off the track.\n\n23:50 So one of the things I think that was really challenging is to resolve the right versions.\n\n23:55 Like I have this version of requests and this version of beautiful soup and this version, whatever.\n\n24:02 And maybe one of them has the same dependency on another with constraints.\n\n24:06 You got to like work that out, right?\n\n24:07 So maybe something you could do with a server is just go, here are all the packages and versions resolve that.\n\n24:12 And then once you figure it out once on the server, you could cache like, well, this combination always resolves to these go like instantly index database query, give me the answer.\n\n24:21 So you basically share the resolution across all of humanity instead of every time an install happens, it starts over.\n\n24:29 Are these the types of...\n\n24:30 That is an example of a kind of thing we could do.\n\n24:32 Okay.\n\n24:33 I think in general, there's maybe two or more ways to think about what we're trying to do here.\n\n24:38 So pyx is not really a PI competitor.\n\n24:42 We're not trying to host public packages for people to consume.\n\n24:46 This is a product that's aimed at companies, enterprises, teams, people who have these problems.\n\n24:52 Maybe they already pay for some kind of alternate registry solution that's not API.\n\n24:57 And so one class of problems is basically, what are things that teams need or have that they can't get from API around packaging and package hosting?\n\n25:07 And some subset there is basically people who come to the uv issue tracker and they use some other registry and they have a bunch of problems with it.\n\n25:13 And we actually can't, we can't solve those because we're like, we can't fix your registry.\n\n25:17 And so like the table stakes thing is like a great private registry, which means something that's really like Python first.\n\n25:25 These alternative solutions that support Python also support like a bunch of different ecosystems and Python is typically like a small thing.\n\n25:31 And so often those registries are...\n\n25:33 We're going to host like, here's your binary artifact.\n\n25:35 And then whatever your thing does to get the artifact, it's just going to get it.\n\n25:39 And like, and that's kind of more or less what might be happening there, right?\n\n25:42 not like deep understanding. For us, it's like, okay, we want a registry that like,\n\n25:46 it should support all the latest standards. It should be really optimized for Python. And we should just provide like a great Python experience because it's Python, like Python is a first class thing. And so that's part of it is like, how do we build just a great private registry that is super modern, is really fast. A lot of the private registries are very slow for a variety of reasons, some of them related to standards. But our goal is like, we want to provide a great experience for that use case. So if you're a company that needs to host private Python packages, especially if you're using uv, we should just be like, well, we want to be the obvious choice for those companies.\n\n26:19 All right. Well, let's say, hold on before we leave that topic. Why would anybody do that?\n\n26:23 Why would anyone do what? Sorry. Want private package hosting?\n\n26:25 A private package. What is this about?\n\n26:27 It's very common. So especially if you get beyond a company of a certain size, maybe you have code that you need to share across the organization, like packages that subsets of your project that you want to be able to use, reuse elsewhere.\n\n26:39 Sometimes at small scale, you'll solve that with like Git dependencies or something.\n\n26:42 Like maybe you just depend on the Git repo.\n\n26:44 But typically as you scale, people will tend to start creating actual packages that they publish.\n\n26:48 In some cases, you also want to be able to do like fine-grained access control around that.\n\n26:53 Like maybe you want to be able to publish code that like only certain people can access within the org or maybe like select customers can access.\n\n27:00 Like these are all use cases we want to be able to serve, which you can't do on PyPI, which is we want to host packages that are not totally public.\n\n27:08 and we want to be able to control who can use them because they contain IP or, well, yeah, I mean, I guess that would be the main reason they control us to contain random IP.\n\n27:16 We want to be able to ship versions of our library to all the other teams at our organization, right?\n\n27:22 Like we wrote the definitive Python library to talk to some service we have running internally.\n\n27:28 We don't want people, everyone recreating some Python library, working with different versions.\n\n27:33 If we roll out a new version of that service, we want to just push to our little internal repository.\n\n27:38 a new version that works with that new and all the projects get it, right?\n\n27:41 Like that kind of thing seems real valuable.\n\n27:43 It's like a library reuse story.\n\n27:46 For those same users, like enterprises that care about this kind of thing, even if they're not publishing private packages, there are other things that we can do here.\n\n27:53 Like we have this, I was going to say pretty cool.\n\n27:55 I think it's pretty cool.\n\n27:56 We have this pretty cool system where you can define what we call like views, which are composed filtered subsets of other registries.\n\n28:04 So you could create like an index URL that represents API, but like frozen at a given point in time. And that's like enforced on the server or even like API, but like only things that are at least a week old. That's like a common thing that people use to guard against malware because malware tends to get removed within a short amount of time. And you can also compose them. So you could create like a single index URL that's like, if we uploaded a package of a certain name, then like get it from our upload. Otherwise, like fall back to API. You could also like disallow specific versions, specific packages.\n\n28:35 You can disallow based on like CVE counts.\n\n28:38 So you can do all this.\n\n28:39 Like we have a DSL for it.\n\n28:40 You basically like write Python code to like define the configuration.\n\n28:44 And then we give you like a single index URL.\n\n28:46 So that's both like simplifying a lot of what's happening.\n\n28:49 Like often you have some subset of this logic in your uv configuration.\n\n28:52 And now it's like, as a team, you can actually centralize like and enforce like compliance rules and give you like a single URL that defines this logic for you and is enforced on the server.\n\n29:02 So again, it's about things that like, these are things that companies care about, right?\n\n29:06 Like if you're an open source project, you probably don't care about this as much.\n\n29:09 But for companies who care a lot about visibility and control and security and this kind of shared centralized logic, it's a really helpful, we found it's a very helpful thing.\n\n29:21 So that's part of it is like companies that need to manage private packages or need to manage like their packaging setup.\n\n29:27 And that I just consider kind of like the table stakes of like what we can provide.\n\n29:31 It's like a great, fast, modern Python registry that kind of doesn't exist, in my opinion, doesn't really exist in the market.\n\n29:38 And it should be really like a natural thing if you're already using uv.\n\n29:42 Then there are some other things we're doing that are kind of maybe a little bit more crazy, but hopefully in a good way.\n\n29:47 The thing that we're trying to do is like, we want to build, it's kind of a similar philosophy that we've taken to the rest of our tooling, which is like pyx, you don't like have to use uv to use pyx.\n\n29:56 Like this is like a registry that implements like the simple API, like the upload API, which is not really standardized.\n\n30:02 But anyway, we implement like all the APIs that other registries implement.\n\n30:06 So you can use like pip and Twine or like whatever with pyx and that's fine.\n\n30:11 You also don't have to use pyx to use uv.\n\n30:13 Obviously you can use uv with like whatever registry you want.\n\n30:16 But our goal is like, if you use uv and pyx together, there are certain things we should be able to do to like deliver a really good experience.\n\n30:22 And some of those are obvious, like authentication is a little bit more seamless.\n\n30:25 Like you can, we kind of like know that you need the credentials.\n\n30:29 We know to prompt you to log in, that kind of thing.\n\n30:31 But there's also a lot of stuff we can do around performance.\n\n30:33 Like if we are the, if we under, if the client and the server kind of know each other, there are different like fast paths we can take to try and make things a lot faster.\n\n30:40 So there's a lot we want to explore there around kind of like, how can we vertically integrate these things while also remaining compatible with the rest of the ecosystem?\n\n30:48 And then there's also this bullet on the bottom, right?\n\n30:50 This GPU aware thing, which is another piece that we should talk about.\n\n30:54 Do AI people, maybe AI people use this? I don't know. That's probably going to be a fad, but you guys might want to add it anyway. Yeah.\n\n31:01 This AI stuff, it's going to be a fad, I'm sure.\n\n31:03 I guess sort of as an aside, it's kind of interesting for us because we don't have or build anything that's AI powered, but we power a lot of AI infrastructure companies. So I don't know, if you think of a big AI company without naming names, they're probably using our stuff. And so it's kind of an interesting position to be in, which is we build a lot of infrastructure that's used by AI companies and also by like end users and even by agents, right? Like if you're running an agent, it's like invoking uv and stuff, but nothing that we build is actually like AI powered in that way, which is kind of a funny position to be in. But basically since the start, we've spent a lot of time in uv trying, I will say specifically trying to make the PyTorch experience good because the PyTorch experience is kind of like, it's not the only thing in GPUs. There's a lot of stuff going on, but PyTorch is just super popular. And so we've always gotten tons of issues around how do I make this PyTorch setup work? Or how do I make, I ran into this error, like what's going on? Or I have this other package that like builds on top of PyTorch and I'm like having trouble getting into work together. So we spend a lot of time trying to make that experience good in uv because it's just super popular. And one of the things that we've come back to many times is like there are problems that, again, there are problems we could solve if we had a server that we kind of can't solve on the client. Like an example would be, there are all these pieces of software that like built, like I said, build against PyTorch and build against certain versions of CUDA, which is like NVIDIA's GPU accelerator library. And those things tend to be hard to build.\n\n32:30 And it's also very hard to make sure that you're getting like compatible versions of them, because there are basically some gaps in the Python standards that make that hard that we're working on. But it's very hard to install like a compatible version of PyTorch and a compatible version of Flash Attention. And it's not really anyone's fault. There are basically gaps in the standards that make that hard. But if we have our own client in our own server, especially actually, even if we just have our own server, there's a bunch of stuff we can do because we can kind of pre-build those for people. We can curate the metadata in certain ways in a way that's all standards compliant, but we could pre-build all those things. And the goal is give people an index that they can point to that will have rebuilt versions of a lot of this stuff that's consistent. The metadata is compatible. They don't have to worry about how do I build it from source?\n\n33:13 They don't have to worry about how do I make sure that all the versions that I'm installing are like mutually compatible. Like that's like another one of the problems that we're trying to solve.\n\n33:20 And again, it's the kind of thing that like we want, we've wanted to be able to offer users for\n\n33:24 a long time, but like there's only so much we can do on the client.

It's a focused code first course that tightens the Python you actually use and adds the habits that make results repeatable. We refactor messy cells into functions and packages, use Git on easy mode, lock environments with uv and even ship with Docker. Keep your notebook speed, add engineering reliability. Find it at Talk Python Training. Just click courses in the nav bar at talkpython.fm. Let's dive into this just a little bit. So is the problem, I am a consumer of LLMs and AI, and I also have written programs that themselves use LLMs, but I have not built an LLM, so I don't really have much experience with this. So is the problem that it's kind of a source distribution that you've got to compile for PyTorch and maybe some other things, or they actually come as binary wheels, but they're incompatible with each other, even though they're pre-compiled?\n\n34:31 What is it that you're kind of doing to make it work here?\n\n34:34 It depends a little bit.\n\n34:34 So like for PyTorch, just as PyTorch itself, like the Python package, like import Torch, we just think about that.\n\n34:41 They do build, they do pre-build wheels, but a lot of the complexity comes from the fact that there's this access that isn't really captured by Python standards, which is the GPU accelerator.\n\n34:53 So on your machine, if you want to run PyTorch, like typically you have a GPU like plugged into your machine.\n\n34:59 And that could be like an NVIDIA GPU, it could be an AMD GPU. And each of those use very different software stacks. And those software stacks are also versioned. So like when they build PyTorch, and they publish to their registry, it's not just like one build. And it's not even just the standard build matrix of like Python version and architecture and operating system. There's like another axis, which is accelerator slash accelerator version. And there's actually no way to capture that really in Python met standards right now. So what they end up doing is they create separate indexes for each of those accelerators. So if you've ever installed PyTorch, there's sort of like a UI on the PyTorch page where you click through like, this is my GPU, this is my operating system, this is my Python version, and it gives you an index URL. And they have different index\n\n35:45 URLs for the different accelerators. Oh, wow. So it shows that multiple projects on PyPI.\n\n35:49 No. So on PyPI, they still basically, those wheels aren't even published on PyPI.\n\n35:56 in general. So they do publish on the API, but they can only publish one, basically one wheel.\n\n36:01 So they publish for one of those GPU versions and all the rest go on the PyTorch index. So like the first, like one source of complexity is as a PyTorch user, how do I like get the right version of PyTorch that's prebuilt? And then there's like a next level of complexity, which is then I have libraries that build against PyTorch and like Flash Attention. So when you build Flash Attention, that's a source distribution and it needs to build against a specific version of PyTorch, Not in a specific version of the GPU.\n\n36:27 So it's yet another dimension.\n\n36:29 It's not just, because it's also specific to like CUDA 12.8 or whatever.\n\n36:34 But in addition, it's also specific to the PyTorch version.\n\n36:37 So they have to publish wheels for each combination of PyTorch version and accelerator.\n\n36:41 And none of those go on PyPI.\n\n36:44 So they publish those to a GitHub releases page, but PyPI is just the source distribution.\n\n36:48 And like the root cause of that problem, of those problems are really some gaps in the standards that are hard to, that are hard to solve.\n\n36:55 it. And we're also working on some standards, some sort of like proposed evolutions to solve this in standards. But ultimately it means that like, it's kind of hard to install the right version of Torch. And then if you need to install these other things, like, like, again, these won't mean anything to you unless you've really used them. But like VLLM is, it's the most popular piece of software that people use for actually serving models. So if you wanted to do inference, like serve an LLM, VLLM would be a very popular choice. And like that has to build against a specific version of Torch and it's built for specific accelerators. And so basically you have these many levels of complexity of how do I get this thing to build? How do I make sure I get the\n\n37:31 right version? And we want to kind of abstract that away from people. I see. It gets combinatorially bad the more you work with pieces. The flash attention build matrix, if you think about it,\n\n37:42 it has, so for a single flash attention version, you have to build across Python version, operating system, architecture, CUDA version, which is like NVIDIA GPU version, and then PyTorch version. And so it's a very big build matrix and it's very hard to get right. Let's talk about\n\n37:59 security a little bit. You talked about some of the things. I really like the idea of just put a delay in there, like a week, a month, whatever. That's pretty new, pretty cutting edge. But by the time something's gone through there, if it's something we're using, it's going to be found out.\n\n38:13 Someone's going to report it, pull it off of PyPI and basically block it. We also recently hired\n\n38:19 William Woodruff joined the team who was an author on the like attestations pep. He implemented a lot of the trusted publishing work in PyPI. So he's done like a lot of the sort of like cutting edge security work in the PyPI ecosystem. And we basically have some ideas for kind of like more outlandish things we can do around security or sorry, outlandish is the wrong word. Maybe like ambitious things we can do around security that we want to explore. Like, I don't know if we'll actually do any of these things, but there's basically things that we can learn from other ecosystems around how to do like more secure workflows for packaging. So like we want that to be a big part of what we're doing. But I think like something that's important for me about this product is like when you think about a registry, like a private registry, a lot of the time it's motivated by like security and compliance. And that is an important piece of what we want to do.\n\n39:09 Like we do want to build a registry that's like very strong in security and compliance, But we also want to solve problems that I think people never really associated with a private registry.\n\n39:20 We want to solve some problems, like the GPU stuff, for example.\n\n39:23 Those are just user experience problems.\n\n39:25 We're trying to use the registry as a way to solve user experience and developer experience problems, even for companies where otherwise they would never have considered using a private registry.\n\n39:34 So our goal is that over time, we build more things into pyx that help with the overall Python experience.\n\n39:40 How do we make your Python team more productive?\n\n39:42 It's not just about how do we help them be more secure.\n\n39:45 That is part of it.\n\n39:47 But like, ultimately, we love building things that make people more productive and like remove problems that they have to like even think about.\n\n39:54 And so ultimately we want to use this as a position to solve more problems.\n\n39:57 Like this PyTorch example you talked about.\n\n40:00 Like the PyTorch example.\n\n40:01 Is there going to be an API for pyx?\n\n40:04 Like if I am a customer of yours and I want to control some things, can I set up automation or are there ways to put code running in pyx that will check on things additionally to webhooks or any of that kind of stuff? Like what is the, I want to participate in pyx sort of thing. I mean, we have a bunch of APIs. So we implement some of the standard,\n\n40:25 what I would call like standardized APIs. So like, obviously like the way that we query package metadata and download packages is based on the simple API. And then we also implement the upload API. So basically uploading and downloading packages follows, that's like public API that follows basically like standards slash what other registries do. Sorry, the upload API is a little bit strange because it tends to be people just do what API does. Outside of that, we do have APIs that we're kind of like considering how we want to expose them. I talked before about this idea of custom views, like being able to sort of declaratively write code to create an index URL, like that should all be scriptable and that should all be public API over time.\n\n41:06 I'll give you a sense of what I'm thinking.\n\n41:07 Like if I'm in charge of developer security, developer package security, supply chain security, I guess I would say at a big organization or any level of organization where it really matters or I care enough to buy your service, maybe I would do something like I would subscribe or I would have an automated system subscribe to a bunch of RSS feeds for security places, right?\n\n41:29 Like leaving computer and others and look at all the articles.\n\n41:32 and if I see PyPI show up, then maybe like, well, let's feed that to an LLM and ask like, okay, well, what packages are actually affected?\n\n41:39 And then if I can determine something we're using, or even if it's not, we're using it, just something relevant that we care about.\n\n41:45 Maybe I want to call an API back to you guys and say, block this one permanently or block it back for like three months ago.\n\n41:52 Like it's us right now.\n\n41:53 We're going to put it on a timeout and make it go back.\n\n41:55 You know what I mean?\n\n41:56 Something like that.\n\n41:57 We should definitely support all of that.\n\n41:59 I have to think about like, whether that's in a position where we'd like make it available to customers yet.\n\n42:04 But in theory, they could absolutely script against that today.\n\n42:07 That is also something you guys could write once and like have it, all right, a little preemptive sort of thing.\n\n42:12 Yes.\n\n42:12 PyPI, what is the role?\n\n42:14 Like I want to publish a package that is a public thing.\n\n42:17 Do I upload it to you guys?\n\n42:19 Do I just publish it to PyPI?\n\n42:21 But are you guys a proxy?\n\n42:22 You mentioned that you're not a replacement for PyPI, but what does that really mean?\n\n42:26 We're not trying to be like the public source of record for like four packages.\n\n42:30 So like for people who are publishing packages, like PyPI is still the place that they should go to like publish those.\n\n42:35 We do mirror in PI.\n\n42:37 So like you can use PIX to install things that ultimately come from PI.\n\n42:42 But you don't necessarily have to proxy through.\n\n42:43 You could just instantly go and pull like a faster local version.\n\n42:47 We kind of like pull those over onto our own infrastructure, which is pretty common,\n\n42:52 like as in other mirrors do this kind of thing too.\n\n42:55 But the nice thing is that like PyPI has like very good uptime.\n\n43:00 But the nice thing is if you depend on us, it also means that you're not introducing like more sources of failure, basically, because we mirror the stuff ourselves.\n\n43:08 So like, obviously we could go down in some sense, but like, you know, you're not relying on both us and PyPI to serve packages, which can be helpful.\n\n43:17 But, you know, the basic idea for us is like, I were obviously like a big fans of API and we, I won't speak for them, but like we spend time with the API team.\n\n43:26 I talked to them about this before we announced it.\n\n43:30 And Ivy PI is a critical piece of a healthy Python ecosystem.\n\n43:34 And we're not trying to displace PI PI as the public source of record for traffic.\n\n43:40 Our goal is we're trying to build something effectively on top, sort of on top of PI PI, a slightly different layer that's more focused on the needs that enterprises have and companies have, which is a little different than what PI is trying to do.\n\n43:53 In my opinion, they could obviously come out and say something.\n\n43:55 I don't, again, I don't want to speak for them, but at least from my perspective, it's a little different than PyPI's mandate. And so for us, I think I said online something like pyx's success depends on the success of PI and like we basically operate that way. So we'll like continue to support. I think it's a hard thing to, to message out succinctly, which is why it's nice to be able to talk about it with you. But like, we're trying to build something that we think addresses like a different gap and it's less focused on how do we compete with like PyPI. And it's more focused on how do we compete with like Artifactory or like other products that are private registries that people pay for? And how can we provide something that's a little bit different than what those people are providing? Is there going to be an on-premise option?\n\n44:35 Oh, such a good question. What are you, a customer? I'm like, we're not doing on-prem right now, but we do have a lot of, we do have a decent amount of people who want it. And I think it will be ultimately be important. But like in the early days of the product, obviously we're very focused on trying to iterate with customers as quickly as we can. And so the fastest feedback there tends to be from, basically we want to be able to deploy this quickly to people and get feedback on it quickly. So on-prem is a much bigger investment and also something that we would...\n\n45:05 Is on-prem the entire implementation? Is it just a proxy server? If you've seen this request before, you've already downloaded it. It's like a little VM that's hanging out in our data center. Just pass it out. That's pretty low hanging fruit. Whereas we want to give you the entire thing in that's a different deal.\n\n45:20 Yeah, we've also experimented with some kind of interesting hybrid models where like all the packages, I shouldn't even say this because then people are going to like come ask for it\n\n45:29 and like I don't really want to support it.\n\n45:30 Don't speak it into existence.\n\n45:32 No, it's kind of a cool idea though.\n\n45:33 It's basically like all the packages would live in an S3 bucket that the customer controls and that we don't even have access to.\n\n45:39 And we could actually support that.\n\n45:41 So we would be like the server that understands metadata about what packages exist and where they are, but we wouldn't actually have access to the contents.\n\n45:48 And there are basically cool ways that we could make that work, which is kind of an interesting hybrid model.\n\n45:53 But anyway, yeah, right now we're pretty focused on not doing on-prem, but I'm sure we will eventually.\n\n45:58 Maybe someday, yeah.\n\n45:59 Yeah.\n\n45:59 Somebody comes with a big enough check and they're like, you know what?\n\n46:02 On-prem is a good idea.\n\n46:03 Let's do that.\n\n46:04 For the right price, on-prem is definitely available.\n\n46:08 I think this is the perfect transition.\n\n46:09 And I know that this has been something that has been discussed on and off basically since uv.\n\n46:17 And for some reason, I don't think it was at all discussed with Ruff.\n\n46:19 I don't know.\n\n46:20 You make that make sense.\n\n46:21 Maybe you can.\n\n46:22 I can't.\n\n46:22 Well, I'll tell you if you're right, depending on what the question is.\n\n46:25 The question is, a lot of people are like, oh my God, uv is incredible.\n\n46:29 We have to switch everything to uv.\n\n46:31 And then there's always someone that says, but it's owned by a company.\n\n46:34 It's not 100% open source.\n\n46:37 What if that changes?\n\n46:38 What if its usage model changes?\n\n46:40 Like, what if Charlie and team decide, like, it's a tenth of a cent per package install and then, like, we're out, right?\n\n46:46 That's certainly been a lingering issue.\n\n46:48 I don't think it was with Ruff.\n\n46:49 People weren't like, well, what if it's like a thousandth of a cent per line of code?\n\n46:53 You know what I mean?\n\n46:54 For some reason about uv, I think it's just more foundational.\n\n46:57 Stuff runs because of uv.\n\n46:59 Stuff is nicer because of Ruff, maybe.\n\n47:00 I don't know.\n\n47:02 There's even a comment by Chris in the audience.\n\n47:04 What if you guys change your mind?\n\n47:06 And I know you've been very open about saying, that's not our intention.\n\n47:08 We intend to build products around it.\n\n47:10 When I saw this announcement, I'm like, wonderful.\n\n47:13 This is the first glimpse into what you guys are building that supports uv, supports Ruff, and all this other stuff you're doing in a way that is not like, well, we took that feature out of uv because it only encourages you to make uv even better.\n\n47:27 So maybe just talk about that for people who are listening around the business model.\n\n47:31 How does this solidify the stuff that you've mentioned and the more abstract?\n\n47:35 I think about this all the time from the start.\n\n47:38 It was something that came up when we talked about Ruff, but I think I've kind of sensed a long, I don't know about a long time, but I've since for a while, there's like kind of two sources of anxiety around this from users. And one form is like, oh, what if we depend on all this stuff?\n\n47:53 And the company goes under, the company disappears. The other form is like, you know, what if we depend on all this stuff? And then they like pull the rug out from under us.\n\n48:00 And the first one is like kind of a little bit easier, I think, to talk about just because we have like a good amount of funding. We're not going to like disappear in the next year or anything like that. We're very well supported. But the second one is, yeah, the second one's obviously more complicated because I'm very transparent. And I've said, I'll say a bunch of things on this podcast that I've said a bunch of other times in other places, but ultimately people, I think we have to basically prove out trust over time. I will say things right here, obviously, I've said, we have no rough uv, our tools should be free forever. And we want to keep them free and open source. And that's like very important. And, but ultimately we have to like earn that trust over time. I think like I can say all these things, but there will still be people who will be skeptical.\n\n48:49 Ultimately our model, it's been the same from the start really, which is, or well, I don't know from the start is wrong. Cause I sort of had no idea what I was doing when I started the company, but like the intention has been, we want to build this like open source that what we think of like as our open source tools, which is like rough UVTY, this tool chain, and that should be free, permissively licensed. And we should be incentivized to like keep investing in it and like to see it grow. And what we want to do from there is monetize services that we build that are kind of like natural extensions of, or I think what I said in the post is something along the lines of the natural next thing you need if you're already using our tooling. And for me, the registry is a really good example of that. Because basically, if you're already using uv, and you're a company that has or needs a registry, we should be the obvious choice for that. And people pay for, not if you're just using PyPI, this might not resonate with you, but a lot of people pay a lot of money for products in that space, for registries. And we should be able to build a better registry and gain a lot of distribution and visibility by building the open source. The open source should basically be in addition to something that we continue to invest in and solves a lot of problems for users and gives value to most people not paying us any money, right? Even in the limit, I think most users of our open source tool will not pay us any money, but like it should be a way for us to get distribution. Like companies should be like, oh, we use this open source thing. We need a solution for this. Okay. That's from the same people. It probably plays really well with the tools. It can probably solve more problems for us. And so that's been very consistent, which is like the tooling should be free, open source, permissively licensed. And we have absolutely no plans to change that. It should always be that way. And what we want to do instead is we view pyx as a different class of things. That's our hosted services as opposed to our open source tools. And we'll keep pushing in that direction. And I shouldn't really say this, but I've been thinking a lot about how people... I've been a software engineer my whole career.\n\n50:46 And we as software engineers have sort of been trained to really distrust corporate open source.\n\n50:52 And it's not without reason. There are a lot of companies that have done things that feel users feel burned by. And I'm very empathetic to that. And so I, as I said, I will be as open and transparent and honest as possible, which is like, we don't want to do that with the tooling.\n\n51:09 Like the tooling is, it's like too important. It's too valuable. It's too like to the community to do that. And so our goal is to like, keep building that stuff. We're investing a lot in continuing to make it great. And then we want to, our goal here with pyx is to build a business on top of it and we'll keep pushing in that direction. So I think there will be hard, I'm sure there will be hard decisions for us around like what goes in the open source and what doesn't. We want as much\n\n51:34 as possible. Single sign-on can go in the closed source. We want as much as possible to like set up\n\n51:40 an incentive structure whereby we actually don't have to like worry about that. Like that's something that I've been trying to do, which is to say like, okay, if there's a problem that we can solve and we can just solve it in the open source, then like we should solve it in the open source. If there's a problem that we can that we can't solve in the open source but we could solve with the server then we should do it there and like that for us at least now that's kind of like our guiding\n\n52:00 how we got our thinking to me it seems super clear that this is not significantly in the way of uv advancing if anything it just puts more energy to uv because as people use pyx well they're effectively customers of uv as well i think the critical thing right that like i can just keep\n\n52:18 saying is we don't we don't want to realize our tools we do not want to charge people money to use our tools i think we find ourselves in a position to do that like as a company we're in serious trouble anyway so i like that is that's something that i'll never do and we're just going to continue to focus on the strategy that we've had from the start which is like we build the free open source tooling we're incentivized to grow it as much as we can that's the thing that we love doing and now we're going to go and try to solve more problems and hopefully problems people will pay for you\n\n52:46 look at the GitHub repository, you guys have almost 67,000 GitHub stars. First of all, congratulations. That's insane. Oh, thanks. When you started this, doesn't that count as success?\n\n52:56 You're like, we have almost as many stars as Django. Like that's pretty wild. I don't know.\n\n53:01 I mean, I think when I started working on this stuff, I would have thought a hundred stars was crazy. I hear you. I totally hear you. I was not like a person who like did a lot of open source.\n\n53:10 And like, so like I said, I, or I not on this show, but I think I've said this before. It's like, I was just average consumer of open source.\n\n53:17 Like I was using open source software all the time, but I wasn't contributing or maintaining or anything.\n\n53:22 And so like for us now, yeah, I don't even like look at the stars anymore.\n\n53:25 I don't know.\n\n53:26 It's like.\n\n53:28 I feel like it's gotta be on star history, right?\n\n53:31 In addition to that, I feel like the reason I brought that up is because worst case scenario, this is not me speaking for me.\n\n53:37 This is me speaking for like the people who are speaking to the people out there who are like, I can't believe what if, like sort of a doom sort of thing.\n\n53:44 It's still out there under a permissive license on GitHub in 2004.\n\n53:48 Because that's pretty likely that there's going to be a version out there.\n\n53:51 But here's your star history.\n\n53:53 Looks pretty good.\n\n53:54 That's cool.\n\n53:54 Yeah.\n\n53:56 It's going strong.\n\n53:56 It's going real strong.\n\n53:57 Yeah.\n\n53:58 Wow, that's a lot.\n\n53:59 It's still going up.\n\n54:01 I know.\n\n54:01 I'll put that link to it in the show notes.\n\n54:03 That's wild.\n\n54:04 Yeah, I know.\n\n54:04 And I mean, we do think a lot too about project governance.\n\n54:08 I remember when, thankfully most people weren't really thinking about this, But when, do you remember when SVB went under Silicon Valley Bank?\n\n54:17 Oh yeah, I absolutely remember.\n\n54:19 That was, yeah, I was very much tracking that.\n\n54:21 Basically all our money was in Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n54:23 Was it?\n\n54:23 Oh no, I didn't even put that together.\n\n54:25 Oh my gosh.\n\n54:26 Okay.\n\n54:26 I mean, which was us and every other startup.\n\n54:29 But at the time we were a pretty small team.\n\n54:32 It was obviously very worrying, but there was also a sense that it would be resolved.\n\n54:36 And, but I remember at the time I got on the phone with the founder of another company that I won't name, but it's a developer tools company.\n\n54:42 And he was like, yeah, I had like a real moment where I was like, wow, if the company goes under, at least the open source project will be totally fine because we've really invested in governance and like it could run like totally without us.\n\n54:55 And I was like, wow, that's amazing because I think like that's what I would like to get to.\n\n55:00 We do think about that.\n\n55:01 It is governance is hard, is very hard.\n\n55:04 And over time, we're trying to build up a bigger contributor base.\n\n55:07 but that's basically the north star for me of like what I would like to get to is like ideally even if the company didn't exist the project could keep going I'm not saying I'm we are absolutely we're not there yet and like I'm fine to admit that but like that's like what I would like to get\n\n55:19 to I guess wrapping this that part of it up I think the concerns about that are overblown people say well I got to learn a new tool like well you just put the letters uv in front of what you're doing before it's probably fine you know what I mean it's like it's not that huge of a investment in terms of like a disruption.\n\n55:34 And I think I, for one, am a wholehearted adopter of uv and the tools and appreciate it every day.\n\n55:41 Thanks. Yeah. No, I appreciate that.\n\n55:42 I mean, I just like, I just love building this stuff, honestly.\n\n55:46 And I just love like solving problems for people.\n\n55:49 Like, it's sort of sad because I find myself with less and less time to just like, like I, a day where I can just hang on the issue tracker and just like close bugs and help people is like the greatest.\n\n56:01 And so I'm trying to find ways to keep doing as much of that as I can.\n\n56:05 But as a team that's grown, obviously my attention gets split in a lot of different ways.\n\n56:08 But basically like a lot of what we're trying to do is just like build, like build a company, right?\n\n56:13 That lets us continue to invest in what is effectively R&D to like build out all this open source tooling.\n\n56:19 And so hopefully, hopefully we can make that work.\n\n56:23 And that's like the push that we're going towards.\n\n56:24 We're pretty much out of time here.\n\n56:25 So let's close it out with people are interested in this.\n\n56:28 What do they do?\n\n56:29 Can they try it out?\n\n56:30 Is it available yet?\n\n56:31 is it for random individual developer type? Yeah, not yet. So like we're starting with\n\n56:36 what we're calling like a closed beta. So we basically launched in private with some customers through like direct outreach, just talking with teams that we'd already been working with. And that's why when we did the public launch, you can see we had a couple of customers already listed on there. And then we put on interest form on, it's linked on the pyx page and in the blog post.\n\n56:53 That's the best thing for people to do is fill out the interest form. We got a lot of responses to the interest form, which is great, but it's also going to take us time to get through them, like many thousands.\n\n57:04 So we started basically going through that list and onboarding people and we'll keep doing that and we'll basically ramp it up over time.\n\n57:11 So we're working towards a GA release and then hopefully everything, the plan then is for everything to be self-serve and for people to try it out themselves.\n\n57:18 But right now we're doing kind of this slow rollout just as we scale up the product and also just like spend more time learning from the early customers.\n\n57:24 You have an idea for what people want, but you've got to actually see.\n\n57:27 Even they might have a thing.\n\n57:28 They might ask.\n\n57:29 We have to actually build it.\n\n57:30 Yeah.\n\n57:32 Well, people also say we want this, but in fact, they actually want something slightly differently, potentially, right?\n\n57:37 I mean, the cool thing is, yeah, we're live in production with companies.\n\n57:41 The amount of traffic's going up and it's, I mean, it's a little scary, but, you know.\n\n57:45 Yeah, I was going to say the bandwidth build is probably not non-trivial.\n\n57:48 And then you start talking to the ML people, their packages are like half a gig, not half a meg, right?\n\n57:53 Yeah, the biggest PyTorch builds are like, like the biggest PyTorch wheels are like, almost three gigs, I think.\n\n57:59 Cool.\n\n57:59 Well, congratulations so far.\n\n58:02 And thanks for coming on and checking in with us and talking about pyx and updates on uv and all that.\n\n58:07 Yeah, thanks for having me back on.\n\n58:08 No, it's always fun.\n\n58:09 And I appreciate the opportunity just to talk more about what we're doing and try to explain what we're building and why.\n\n58:14 And yeah, I'm excited to come back on hopefully at some point in the future.\n\n58:18 Yeah.\n\n58:18 When you're ready to share more, you're always welcome.\n\n58:20 So thanks for being on.\n\n58:21 Appreciate it.\n\n58:21 See you later.\n\n58:21 Thanks a lot.\n\n58:22 Take care.\n\n58:22 Yep.\n\n58:23 Bye.\n\n58:23 Bye.\n\n58:24 This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me.\n\n58:27 Thank you to our sponsors.\n\n58:29 Be sure to check out what they're offering.\n\n58:30 It really helps support the show.\n\n58:32 Thanks again to Six Feet Up, the Python and AI experts you call for the hardest software problems.\n\n58:38 From scaling applications to simplifying data complexity and unlocking AI outcomes, they help you move forward faster.\n\n58:45 See what's possible with Six Feet Up.\n\n58:47 Visit talkpython.fm/sixfeetup.\n\n58:51 Want to level up your Python?\n\n58:52 We have one of the largest catalogs of Python video courses over at Talk Python.\n\n58:56 Our content ranges from true beginners to deeply advanced topics like memory and async.\n\n59:01 And best of all, there's not a subscription in sight.\n\n59:04 Check it out for yourself at training.talkpython.fm.\n\n59:07 Be sure to subscribe to the show, open your favorite podcast app, and search for Python.\n\n59:12 We should be right at the top.\n\n59:13 You can also find the iTunes feed at /itunes, the Google Play feed at /play, and the direct RSS feed at /rss on talkpython.fm.\n\n59:23 We're live streaming most of our recordings these days.\n\n59:25 If you want to be part of the show and have your comments featured on the air, be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel at talkpython.fm/youtube.\n\n59:34 This is your host, Michael Kennedy.\n\n59:35 Thanks so much for listening.\n\n59:37 I really appreciate it.\n\n59:38 Now get out there and write some Python code.\n\n59:52 *music*",

      "headline": "The Agony of Trump’s Oligarchs",

And though they claim Trump’s “state-driven capitalism”—which I think is more accurately termed fascist corporatism—offends their sense of patriotism, what they really seem to resent is having routinely to pay Trump tribute, either by enriching him personally or by helping him try to plug the $3 trillion revenue hole he created with his idiot “big, beautiful bill.” This is government by shakedown, and they are the mark. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the CEOs said Trump’s tariffs have hurt their businesses, and three-quarters said the tariffs were illegal, which of course they are. Seventy-one percent said Trump has eroded the independence of the Federal Reserve (the sole regulatory agency they respect), and 80 percent said Trump’s pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates is harmful, which of course it is.\n\nWhat they most especially hated, though, was (per Sonnenfeld’s summary in a September 21 Fortune article co-authored with his Yale colleague Stephen Henriques) “the Trump administration’s drift toward a quasi-socialist statism, seizing ownership from private shareholders, dictating staffing, and selectively blocking moves into strategic markets based upon politics and kickbacks.” Among the policies of which they “firmly disapproved” were the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel and MP Materials, skimming a cut from Nvidia’s and AMD’s chip sales to China, and reserving for the federal government a “golden share” in the U.S. Steel-Nippon merger.",

      "headline": "Meet the Snapdragon X2 Elite, Qualcomm's new 18-core PC chip that rivals the Apple M4",
      "content": "Qualcomm has officially announced the evolution of its PC chip endeavors with the Snapdragon X2 Elite, a chip that is comprised of a whopping 18 cores and promises to pump out some serious performance.\n\nWhen it comes to PCs, there are really only two major companies that you’ll see chips from in laptops and desktops—Intel and AMD. In 2024, Qualcomm came along with its Snapdragon X Elite chip, giving consumers an alternative to the two biggest options. The first Lenovo laptops with the Snapdragon X Elite launched last May, and Dell put out a laptop a month later.\n\nWhile there were several benefits to Qualcomm’s chip inside a laptop, one of the most important ones was battery life. Qualcomm was boasting long battery life on a single charge. This isn’t something you get often with laptops. The good news is that Qualcomm is back and promising even better battery life for laptops powered by the Snapdragon X2 Elite. So, if long battery life is what you’re looking for, then you’ll want to keep your eye on these laptops.\n\nQualcomm says the just-announced Snapdragon X2 Elite can offer multi-day battery life to laptops\n\nIf a laptop lasting for multiple days on battery doesn’t entice you, then you must love the tedious nature of having to plug your devices in every single day. That being said, if you hate charging your stuff all the time, then Snapdragon X2 Elite-powered laptops are likely to be your new best friend.\n\nQualcomm says this new chip can offer multi-day battery life. That could mean two days, or it could mean three or more. What’s really important, however, is that it’s more than one. Qualcomm doesn’t mention specifics, but it says users won’t have to compromise on performance to get more hours out of their machine. The firm also claims that the chip rivals the Apple M4, beating it out in benchmarks. Qualcomm made a similar claim with the first version of this chip when compared to the Apple M3. It outperformed Intel’s Core Ultra, too. So it’s not too hard to imagine the new model continuing this trend.\n\nThere will be three different models of the chip\n\nQualcomm says it’s launching three different models of the Snapdragon X2 Elite, so there should be a varying range of laptops at different price points. First, there’s the X2E-80-100. This is the least powerful version, coming with 12 cores instead of 18. It also has a smaller cache of 34MB. Despite these tweaks, it still offers the same frequencies. Its boost frequency is up to 4.7GHz for the single core and up to 4.4GHz for the dual-core. This is similar to the second variant, which is impressive.\n\nNext up there’s the X2E-88-100, which comes with a total of 18 cores. While its frequencies are similar to the lower-tier model, it does come with some key benefits. It has a 53MB total cache, and it supports up to 12 PCIe Gen 5 lanes as opposed to 8. It also has a slightly higher boost frequency with dual-core of 4.7GHz. Lastly, there’s the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme, or the X2E-96-100. This bumps the max boost frequency up to 5.0GHz for both single-core and dual-core. Other benefits consumers can expect from this chip are support for Bluetooth 5.4, Bluetooth LE, and up to Wi-Fi 7 speeds, just to name a few.",

      "content": "Qualcomm is back for round two of its push into Windows PCs . At its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii, the company revealed its Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme. These chips will serve as the high-end offerings in Qualcomm's second generation of Arm-based chips for laptops and other PC form factors.\n\nThe Elite Extreme is a new tier above the standard Elite, which was the top chip in the original X-series line. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme will offer up to 18 cores, and Qualcomm claims it's the first Arm chip to hit 5 GHz (on up to two cores).\n\nThe company says its Elite chips will be made on a 3-nanometer process node. The Snapdragon X2 Elite uses a mix of Qualcomm Oryon Prime cores and what it calls Performance CPU cores. This is seemingly a standard Performance/Efficiency layout with different names. At normalized power, Qualcomm says it offers up to 75% more performance than its competitors. In multitasking, it claims the new chips will offer up to 31% faster performance at a normalized ISO power, while needing 43% less power than last-gen chips. We don't yet have benchmarks to share, and Qualcomm didn't note the exact TDPs for these chips.\n\n(Image credit: Qualcomm)\n\nThe Elite Extreme has higher clock speeds in both single- and dual-core boost and multi-core max than the other two Snapdragon X2 Elite variants. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is model X2E-96-100, while the standard Elites are X2E-88-100 and X2E-80-100. The Extreme and the 88-100 each have 18 cores, while the 80-100 has 12 cores.\n\nThere's also a new Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which the company says brings a 2.3x increase in performance per watt and power efficiency compared to the last generation. The new 80 TOPS NPU looks to be the fastest in a laptop (with INT8 math), with 78% more TOPS than the previous generation, 45 TOPS NPU. In its press release, Qualcomm writes that this NPU \"is designed to handle Copilot+ and concurrent AI experiences.\" (Copilot+ doesn't include actual Copilot, the assistant that runs largely in the cloud.)\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme Snapdragon X2 Elite Snapdragon X2 Elite Part number X2E-96-100 X2E-88-100 X2E-80-100 Cores (Prime / Performance) 12 / 6 12 / 6 6 / 6 Boost frequency (Single-core / dual-core) 5.0 GHz / 5.0 GHz 4.7 GHz / 4.7 GHz 4.7 GHz / 4.4 GHz Multi-core max frequency 3.6 GHz 3.4 GHz 3.4 GHz Total cache 53 MB 53 MB 34 MB Qualcomm Adreno GPU part X2-90 X2-90 X2-85 Max frequency (GPU) 1.85 GHz 1.70 GHz 1.70 GHz NPU TOPS (INT8) 80 80 80 Memory Type LPDDR5X-9523 LPDDR5X-9523 LPDDR5X-9523 Max memory capacity 128+ GB 128 GB 128 GB Bus width 192-bit 128-bit 128-bit Bandwidth 228 GB/s 152 GB/s 152 GB/s Image Signal Processor Qualcomm Spectra ISP Qualcomm Spectra ISP Qualcomm Spectra ISP Cellular Modem-RF Snapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF System Snapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF System Snapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF System Connectivity Up to Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Up to Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Up to Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4\n\nThe X2 Elite chip supports Qualcomm's x75 5G modem-RG system, with up to 10 Gbps peak downloads. It also works with Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 for Wi-FI 7/6/6E and Bluetooth 5.4 LE.

That may mean we’ll see a device or two at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, before launch. Notably, Qualcomm's images and a sizzle reel both suggest that the X2 Elite will appear in both laptops and mini PCs.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Subsequently, a full lineup including the X Plus (in both 10-core and 8-core variants) and a standard Snapdragon X chip were released. The top-end chips appeared in designs from major manufacturers, including Microsoft, Samsung, Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo, and Acer.\n\nThe initial chips showed off their efficiency through long battery life, and we hope to see the X2 SoCs build on that. They didn't, however, work with some applications (namely games) and we want to see better emulation support there. Windows on Arm, however, didn't exactly take over the market, so we'll see what the new chips bring to the table.\n\nQualcomm is announcing these chips pretty early. The Snapdragon Summit comes ahead of Apple's next major release (Apple is Qualcomm's biggest rival in Arm-based systems), which is rumored to be early next year. And of course, by the time many X2 devices make it to market in the first half of 2026, AMD and Intel may also have next-gen x86 chips ready to compete.\n\nNext year is shaping up to be an eventful one for those looking to buy a new laptop, which should be good for consumers and the industry as a whole. After a fairly quiet 2025 on the mobile front, it’ll also be nice to have some fresh silicon to test.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "content": "is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nLast year, after well over a decade of trying, Qualcomm finally made Windows on Arm laptops a thing, putting both Intel and AMD on notice and shoving Intel out of consumer-grade Microsoft Surface machines. Today, we’re learning about the second generation of the chip that made it happen, one which’ll now come in two distinct flavors: the Snapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme.\n\nQualcomm is making a gigantic claim right in the headline of its press release: it says these are “the fastest and most efficient processors for Windows PCs.” I’m sure Intel and AMD will have something to say about that!\n\nFrom Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit video. Image: Qualcomm\n\nBut for now, the company claims its 3nm chips offer up to 31 percent faster CPU performance than the previous-gen Snapdragon X Elite at the same power, or can require 43 percent less power, and with up to 2.3x the GPU performance per watt (not a pure performance boost) from a new 1.85GHz GPU. On the CPU side, it’s using a 3rd-gen Oryon CPU that’ll also feature in Qualcomm’s new mobile flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite 5 chip, but here with up to 18 cores, 12 of which can run up to 4.4GHz, or up to two of them at 5GHz — a clockspeed which Qualcomm says is a first for Arm CPUs.\n\nYou can see more specs below, and at Qualcomm’s website and overview PDF.\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nThere’s also a new 80 TOPS Hexagon NPU, for AI tasks, that offers 37 percent more performance with a 16 percent power consumption improvement, and the company claims it’s the fastest laptop NPU by far:\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm’s characterizing all of this as a “legendary leap in performance,” claiming the Elite Extreme in particular offers “up to 75 percent faster CPU performance” than competitors at the same power.\n\nWhile it doesn’t say which competitors it’s talking about in the press release, it appears that Qualcomm is comparing against some of the most powerful (and power-hungry) laptop chips in the market, including the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H and AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, and you can see Qualcomm isn’t labeling both axes of its graphs:\n\nImage: Qualcomm Image: Qualcomm\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm also claims these power savings will lead to “multi-day battery life,” but that’s what the company already said about last year’s Snapdragon X Elite. (We saw 14 to 18 hours from last year’s laptops, so perhaps that’s multi-day defined as “two eight-hour workdays.”)\n\nImage: Qualcomm\n\nStill, these sound like very solid improvements, and some of them come from distinct new portions of the silicon. Gaming on Arm, which still needed work last year, will get a boost from a dedicated new 18MB of high speed cache that Qualcomm’s calling “Adreno High Performance Memory.”\n\nAnd Qualcomm says Adobe creators will see big improvements over last year’s laptops: 28 percent faster photo editing in Photoshop, 43 percent faster exports from Lightroom, and a similar boosts to Premiere video analysis. Razer’s Min-Liang Tan also announced today that Razer will bring its Synapse software to Windows on Snapdragon, which is likely to be a polarizing announcement. He notably did not promise that Razer will make a Snapdragon-based gaming laptop.\n\nIt’s intriguing to see that the company’s testing its X2 Elite Extreme at over 50W of power; last year, Snapdragon chips were just for thin and light laptops, but 50W lets them scale into bigger PCs.\n\nNote that when Qualcomm had its coming out party with Microsoft last year, the laptops arrived later that year. That’s not happening this time around: they’re “expected to be available 1H26,” the company writes.\n\nQualcomm’s announcement also doesn’t mention whether these chips will feature in its hinted-at collaboration with Google on Android for PC, but Sameer Samat, Google’s president of Android Ecosystem, suggested that the merger ChromeOS and Android might be on a similar schedule. “That combination is something we’re super excited about for next year,” he says.\n\nCorrection, September 24th: The new GPU boasts 2.3x performance per watt than the previous generation, not 2.3x the performance overall.",

      "headline": "First Atlantic Nickel Renames Atlantic Nickel Project to Pipestone XL to Reflect 100% Ownership of 30 km Pipestone Ophiolite Complex and Provides Updates on RPM Phase 2x Program",
      "content": "GRAND FALLS-WINDSOR, Newfoundland and Labrador, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Atlantic Nickel Corp. (TSXV: FAN) (OTCQB: FANCF) (FSE: P21) (\"First Atlantic\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has renamed its flagship Atlantic Nickel Project to Pipestone XL, reflecting the Company's 100% ownership of the entire 30-kilometer Pipestone Ophiolite Ultramafic Complex. The new name emphasizes the district-scale potential of the project, which hosts multiple zones of awaruite (Ni3Fe) nickel alloy mineralization, including the high-priority RPM Zone, the Super Gulp Zone, the historical Atlantic Lake Zone, and additional discoveries of visible awaruite mineralization discovered during the Company’s 2025 regional exploration program throughout the complex. The RPM Phase 2 drilling program will now be referred to as Phase 2X, underscoring the Company's objective to double (“2X”) both the strike length and expand the width of awaruite mineralization established during the Phase 1 drill program at the RPM Zone. The Pipestone XL name also highlights the project's clean energy potential, including ongoing geologic hydrogen research in partnership with Colorado School of Mines announced March 19, 2025 .\n\nFollowing a series of acquisitions in the first half of 2024 that consolidated the entire 30-kilometer Pipestone Ophiolite Complex, First Atlantic has advanced the geological understanding of this serpentinized ultramafic complex through systematic exploration. The Company's technical team, led by Senior Project Geologist Michael Piller, author of the 2011 Memorial University thesis \"An Examination of Awaruite (Ni₃Fe) Formation During Serpentinization of the Pipestone Pond Ophiolitic Complex in the Atlantic Lake Area, Central Newfoundland\" researched in conjunction with Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (now Cleveland-Cliffs - a large US steel producer) and Altius Resources Inc., recognized that historical exploration focused primarily on the northern Atlantic Lake area, while the southern regions remained underexplored. This district-scale approach led to the discovery of the RPM and Super Gulp zones during surface exploration in late summer 2024, followed by the first drill testing that fall.\n\nPipestone XL represents a continuous, 30 km belt of heavily faulted, serpentinized ultramafic rocks enriched in nickel and chromium and characterized by a strong magnetic anomaly. Importantly, awaruite mineralization occurs at surface, offering a significant advantage for mineral exploration and potential development. The Company's Phase 1 drilling program delineated a 400m x 500m area of disseminated awaruite mineralization at the RPM Zone, returning the highest awaruite nickel grades drilled to date at Pipestone XL. Mineralization observed at the RPM zone to date extends from surface to 495 meters downhole and remains open at depth. Davis Tube Recovery (DTR) metallurgical testing confirmed magnetic concentrate grades averaging 1.38% nickel and 1.67% chromium, yielding an average DTR nickel grade of 0.12% with a mass pull of 9.08%. The Phase 2X program is now underway, embodying the Company's mission to double (2X) the strike length and width of the RPM Zone, while incorporating new geological insights from district-scale exploration across all three mineralized zones. In parallel, investigations into Pipestone XL's geologic hydrogen potential continue through the Company’s research collaboration with the Colorado School of Mines.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nPipestone XL: Reflects First Atlantic’s 100% ownership of a 30 km continuous belt of ultramafic rocks enriched in awaruite nickel and chromium, characterized by a distinct magnetic signature anomaly.\n\nReflects First Atlantic’s 100% ownership of a 30 km continuous belt of ultramafic rocks enriched in awaruite nickel and chromium, characterized by a distinct magnetic signature anomaly.

First Atlantic secured 100% ownership of the complex through multiple acquisitions in 2024, followed by systematic exploration that revealed numerous surface outcrops of visible awaruite mineralization. From this work, the RPM and Super Gulp Zones emerged as priority drill targets. The ophiolite's harzburgite and dunite composition, combined with extensive faulting and serpentinization, creates optimal conditions for awaruite nickel mineralization.\n\nHistorical drilling in 1978 at the Atlantic Lake zone in the northern portion of the ophiolite complex, intersected 0.22% nickel over 87.15 meters (DDH78-AL-1, NFLD/3284). The hole ended in mineralization without testing deeper, highlighting untested potential at depth. Previous exploration efforts largely concentrated on this northern area, while the southern extent of the complex remained underexplored until First Atlantic's systematic approach led to the discovery of the RPM Zone, located 26 kilometers south of Atlantic Lake and 10 kilometers south of Super Gulp.\n\nPhase 1 drilling at RPM successfully intersected disseminated awaruite mineralization in all holes from surface to depth. DTR testing confirmed magnetically recoverable nickel grades averaging 0.12% DTR across all drilled intervals, with magnetic concentrate grades of 1.38% nickel. These results demonstrate consistent awaruite nickel mineralization across the entire 400 m x 500 m Phase 1 footprint, which remains open in all directions and underscores the potential for large-scale bulk tonnage mineralization. Building on this success, the Phase 2X program’s goal is to double the strike length and expand the width of the mineralized zone.\n\nRPM PHASE 2X DRILL PROGRAM\n\nThe Phase 2X program aims to double the size of the RPM Zone from its current 400-meter by 500-meter area, where Phase 1 drilling confirmed widespread magnetically recoverable awaruite nickel averaging 0.12% DTR across all drilled intervals.\n\nBased on improved geological understanding showing that the mineralization dips to the west, the Company will aim to drill with an optimal primary orientation from east to west. This approach will better intersect the mineralized zones at the proper angle and provide more accurate measurements of their true thickness. This represents a strategic adjustment from the initial westward drilling direction used at the Super Gulp zone.\n\nThe drilling program will systematically expand outward from the known mineralized area using step-out holes, targeting large volumes of disseminated awaruite suitable for bulk mining. The Company has identified that nickel grades vary by rock type: narrower dunite layers within the peridotite typically contain less 0.08% DTR nickel, while the broader peridotite (harzburgite) units contain higher grades of 0.10-0.17% DTR nickel and can extend for over 500 meters in drilled width. This knowledge of how grades are distributed across different rock types will help optimize drill targeting as the Company pursues its goal of doubling the size of the RPM Zone.\n\nFigure 2: Drill Core from RPM Phase 2X Program preparing for shipment to analytical lab for assay and davis tube metallurgical testing.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Magnetically Recovered Nickel Results from 2024 and 2025 Diamond Drill Holes – RPM Zone Drilling at the Pipestone XL (formerly Atlantic Nickel project)\n\nDrill Hole Zone Section From meters To meters Interval meters Magnetically Recovered (DTR)\n\nNickel % Magnetic Concentrate Nickel\n\nGrade (Ni %) Mass Pull (%)\n\n\n\nComment AN 24 - 02 RPM S1 11.0 394.1 383.1 0.13 1.37 9.50 NR - March 12, 2025 AN 24 - 03 RPM S1 18.0 234.0 216.0 0.11 1.32 9.12 NR - April 15, 2025 AN 24 - 04 RPM S1 12.0 378.0 366.0 0.14 1.46 9.53 NR- June 24, 2025 AN 24 - 05 RPM S2 6.0 357.0 351.0 0.12 1.47 8.21 NR - July 9, 2025 AN 25 - 06 RPM S2 5.65 453 447.35 0.11 1.27 9.02 NR - August 12, 2025 AN 25 - 07 RPM S2 495.0 pending pending samples submitted AN 25 - 08 RPM S3 491.0 pending pending samples submitted AN 25 - 09 RPM S3 480.0 pending pending samples submitted AN 25 - 10 RPM S1 samples submitted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: RPM Zone Phase 2X drilling map at Pipestone XL.\n\nCEO STATEMENT\n\nAdrian Smith, CEO of First Atlantic, commented: \"The Pipestone XL name reflects our 100% ownership of the 30-kilometer ophiolite belt of ultramafic rocks and the multi-zone potential of this district-scale discovery.

The recent announcement by FPX Nickel and JOGMEC (Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security) designating the Advocate property in Newfoundland as their first designated project - selected from more than 50 targets across 10 jurisdictions worldwide - further validates the exceptional potential of ophiolite-hosted awaruite deposits in our province. As nickel demand grows to support batteries, stainless steel and future technologies, Pipestone XL is well positioned to become a crucial North American source of this essential metal. Our awaruite's unique magnetic properties enable direct concentration without traditional smelting, offering a cleaner, more sustainable pathway to supply the industries and infrastructure that power our modern economy.\"\n\nNEWFOUNDLAND MINING ADVANTAGE\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador consistently ranks in the world’s top 10 mining jurisdictions, according to the Fraser Institute's 2024 Annual Survey of Mining Companies. The province combines world-class geology with supportive government policies and well-established infrastructure. As the survey notes: \"Two Canadian provinces, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland & Labrador, appear in the list of top ten most attractive jurisdictions for mining investment.\"1 Newfoundland and Labrador also offers one of the most efficient regulatory environments in Canada. The province's streamlined permitting process has enabled First Atlantic to advance from acquisition to drilling in under 12 months, with exploration permits often granted in as little as three weeks.\n\nFigure 4: Ranking of attractive mining destinations in North America, from the Fraser Institute’s 2024 Annual Survey of Mining Companies2.\n\nThe recent successful construction and commissioning of Equinox Gold's Valentine Lake Mine demonstrate Newfoundland's ability to support major mining projects from exploration through to production. On September 15, 2025, Equinox Gold Corp. announced its first gold pour at Valentine Lake, noting: \"Once fully operational, Valentine will be Equinox Gold's second-largest mine, the largest gold mine in Atlantic Canada.\"3 Located in central Newfoundland, Valentine Lake validates the region's infrastructure and skilled workforce, both critical for advancing large-scale mining operations.\n\nIn addition, FPX Nickel's partnership with JOGMEC to acquire the Advocate awaruite project in Newfoundland, announced on September 23, 20254, highlights growing international recognition of the province's potential for this rare nickel mineral. FPX has been a pioneer in awaruite exploration through their Decar project in British Columbia, and its entry into Newfoundland further validates the prospectivity of the region's ultramafic rock belts.\n\nAWARUITE - RARE & PURE NATURAL NICKEL-IRON-COBALT ALLOY MINERAL\n\nThe sulfur-free nature of awaruite (Ni 3 Fe), a naturally occurring nickel-iron-cobalt alloy already in metallic form, eliminates the need for secondary processes such as smelting, roasting or acid leaching that are typical of sulfide or laterite nickel ores. Unlike sulfides, which are not natural alloys, awaruite avoids the challenge of sourcing smelter capacity - a bottleneck in North America's nickel supply chain. With an average nickel grade of approximately 76%, awaruite significantly exceeds the ~25%5 nickel grade characteristic of pentlandite. Awaruite's strong magnetic properties enable concentration through magnetic separation, as demonstrated by Davis Tube Recovery (DTR) testing at First Atlantic's RPM Zone drill core.\n\nAwaruite eliminates the electricity requirements, emissions, and environmental impacts associated with conventional smelting, roasting or acid leaching processes of common nickel minerals. Moreover, awaruite's sulfur-free composition removes the risks of acid mine drainage (AMD) and related permitting challenges commonly posed by sulfide minerals.6 As noted by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 2012: \"The development of awaruite deposits in other parts of Canada may help alleviate any prolonged shortage of nickel concentrate. Awaruite, a natural iron-nickel alloy, is much easier to concentrate than pentlandite, the principal sulfide of nickel.\"\n\nFigure 5: Quote from USGS on Awaruite Deposits in Canada\n\nInvestor Information\n\nThe Company's common shares trade on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol \"FAN\", the American OTCQB Exchange under the symbol “FANCF” and on several German exchanges, including Frankfurt and Tradegate, under the symbol \"P21\".\n\nInvestors can get updates about First Atlantic by signing up to receive news via email and SMS text at www.fanickel.com .

The qualified person is a member in good standing of the Professional Engineers and Geoscientists Newfoundland and Labrador (PEGNL) and is a registered professional geoscientist (P.Geo.). Mr. Smith has reviewed and approved the technical information disclosed herein.\n\nAnalytical Method & QA/QC\n\nSamples were split in half on site, with one half remaining in the core box for future reference and the other half securely packaged for laboratory analysis. The QA/QC protocol included the insertion of blanks, duplicates, and certified reference material (standards), with one QA/QC sample being inserted every 20 samples to monitor the precision and accuracy of the laboratory results. All analytical results successfully passed QA/QC screening at the laboratory, and all Company inserted standards and blanks returned results within acceptable limits.\n\nSamples were submitted to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (“Actlabs”) in Ancaster, Ontario, an ISO 17025 certified and accredited laboratory operating independently of First Atlantic. Each sample was crushed, with a 250 g sub-sample pulverized to 95% - 200 mesh. A magnetic separate was then generated by running the pulverized sub-sample through a magnetic separator which splits the sub-sample into magnetic and non-magnetic fractions. This involves running a 30 g split of the pulp through a Davis Tube magnetic separator as a slurry using a constant flow rate, a magnetic field strength of 3,500 Gauss, and a tube angle of 45 degrees to produce magnetic and non-magnetic fractions.\n\nThe magnetic fractions are collected, dried, weighed and the magnetic fraction is fused with a lithium metaborate/tetraborate flux and lithium bromide releasing agent and then analyzed on a wavelength dispersive XRF for multiple elements including nickel, cobalt, iron and chromium. The magnetically recovered nickel grade was then calculated by multiplying the XRF fusion nickel value by the weight of the magnetic fraction and dividing by the total recorded feed weight or magnetic mass pulled from the sample.\n\nTrue widths are currently unknown. However, the nickel bearing ultramafic ophiolite and peridotite rocks being targeted and sampled in the Phase 1 drilling program at the Pipestone XL (formerly the Atlantic Nickel Project) are mapped on surface and in drilling as several hundred meters to over 1 kilometer wide and approximately 30 kilometers long.\n\nAbout First Atlantic Nickel Corp.\n\nFirst Atlantic Nickel Corp. (TSXV: FAN) (OTCQB: FANCF) (FSE: P21) is a Canadian mineral exploration company developing the 100%-owned Pipestone XL (formerly the Atlantic Nickel Project), a large-scale nickel project strategically located near existing infrastructure in Newfoundland, Canada. The Project's nickel occurs as awaruite, a natural nickel-iron-cobalt alloy containing approximately 75% nickel with no-sulfur and no-sulfides. Awaruite's properties allow for smelter-free magnetic separation and concentration, which could strengthen North America's critical minerals supply chain by reducing foreign dependence on nickel smelting. This aligns with new US Electric Vehicle US IRA requirements, which stipulate that beginning in 2025, an eligible clean vehicle may not contain any critical minerals processed by a FEOC (Foreign Entities Of Concern)7.\n\nFirst Atlantic aims to be a key input of a secure and reliable North American critical minerals supply chain for the stainless steel and electric vehicle industries in the USA and Canada. The company is positioned to meet the growing demand for responsibly sourced nickel that complies with the critical mineral requirements for eligible clean vehicles under the US IRA. With its commitment to responsible practices and experienced team, First Atlantic is poised to contribute significantly to the nickel industry's future, supporting the transition to a cleaner energy landscape. This mission gained importance when the US added nickel to its critical minerals list in 2022, recognizing it as a non-fuel mineral essential to economic and national security with a supply chain vulnerable to disruption.\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nForward-looking statements:\n\nThis news release may include \"forward-looking information\" under applicable Canadian securities legislation.

      "headline": "Microsoft is resorting to laser etching AI-designed cooling channels directly into data center chips to tame their massive heat",
      "content": "Introducing microfluidic cooling: a breakthrough in chip cooling technology - YouTube Watch On\n\nIf you think the power consumption of today's gaming graphics cards is bad, it's nothing compared to how energy the massive processors in AI and data systems use. All that power ends up as heat, resulting in chip cooling being a serious challenge. Microsoft reckons it has a great solution, though, and it's all about getting water into the processors themselves.\n\nThe most complex direct-die, liquid cooling loops you'll see in a gaming PC all involve using a chamber that mounts on top of the CPU. At no point does the coolant ever touch the chip directly. In a recently published blog, Microsoft explains how it has developed a system that does precisely that.\n\nBy etching the surface of the processor die with an intricate pattern of tiny channels, water can then be pumped directly into the silicon itself, albeit to a very shallow depth.\n\nThe keyword to describe this is microfluidics, a technology that's been around for many decades, and if the history of consumer tech is anything to go by, it'll be a phrase plastered across every CPU cooler within a couple of years (though not actually do anything).\n\nThis might all just seem like Microsoft is cutting a few grooves into the chip and having water to flow through it, but it's far more complicated than that. For a start, the channels themselves are no wider than a human hair, and they're not just simple lines either. Microsoft employed the services of Swiss firm Corintis, which used AI to determine the best pattern for maximum heat transfer.\n\n(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nThe end result is a network of microchannels that genuinely look organic, though at first glance, you'd be forgiven for thinking the complex patterns were just manufacturing defects. It certainly looks super cool (pun very much intended).\n\nMicrosoft claims the tech is up to three times more effective at removing heat from a massive AI GPU than a traditional cold plate (aka waterblock), citing a 65% reduction in the maximum temperature rise of the silicon.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nSince all the coolant transfer apparatus doesn't need to be right on top of the microchannels, the system can also be applied to stacked chips, with each one etched before mounting. This way, each die within the stack is cooled individually, meaning they can operate closer to their maximum specifications than with a normal cold plate.\n\nTake AMD's X3D processors, for example. These all have one stacked chip underneath the heatsink: a Core Complex Die (CCD) bonded to a 3D V-Cache die. Each one acts as a thermal barrier to the other, though the CCD does generate much more heat than the cache die. If these could be both cooled via microfluidics, you'd be able to operate them both at higher clock speeds.\n\nOf course, such complex tech isn't cheap to develop or implement, and the likelihood of it ever appearing at the consumer level is very slim. But I wouldn't be surprised if somebody takes an RTX 5090, rips off the heatsink, and swaps it for a homebrewed microfluidic cooler.\n\nThere again, if ramping up power consumption is the only way AMD, Intel, and Nvidia can keep improving chip performance, perhaps we might see etched processors and direct-die cooling being standard fare in our gaming PCs. After all, it wasn't that long ago when heatpipes and vapour chambers were phrases never to be uttered by a PC component manufacturer, but now they're in coolers of every kind.",

See all of our newsletters\n\nFounded in 2019 by former Google researchers Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang and Nick Frosst, Cohere has carved out a niche by focusing exclusively on serving companies and governments. It exclusively designs A.I. products for the enterprise market and has avoided pursuing consumer-first tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\n“We believe that Cohere’s A.I. solutions are meeting an ignored demand in the market for technology that truly improves the efficiency of business and governments, while keeping full control of their data in their own hands,” said Francois Chadwick, Cohere’s chief financial officer, in a statement. The company’s sustained investor demand represents “a big endorsement of our momentum deploying secure and sovereign A.I. for the enterprise,” he added.\n\nCohere said the new funding will help scale the adoption of its products globally across both public and private sectors. Earlier this year, the startup launched its latest model family, the Command A series, which includes systems for reasoning, machine translation and visual data. Its agentic A.I. platform, North, is designed to handle sensitive information for regulated industries and governments.\n\nNorth users include AMD, which today announced plans to integrate the platform across its enterprise portfolio. Under an expanded partnership, Cohere’s products will also be powered by AMD’s Instinct GPUs.\n\nOther major customers include Fujitsu, Bell and the Royal Bank of Canada. The startup has nearly tripled its annualized revenue this year, from $35 million in March to more than $100 million in May. Growth is also being fueled by government demand: last month, Cohere signed a non-binding deal with Canada’s federal government to integrate its technology into public service operations.",

      "headline": "Laptop vs. Stationary Pc: What Is Best for The Home Office?",
      "content": "The morning commute has become a short walk down the hallway for millions of professionals worldwide. Remote work, once considered a temporary solution, has fundamentally transformed how we approach our professional lives. This shift has placed unprecedented demands on our home computing setups, forcing many to reconsider whether their trusty laptop or aging desktop can meet the challenges of full-time remote work.\n\nThe decision between a laptop and a stationary PC for your home office goes beyond simple preference. Each option brings distinct advantages and limitations that can significantly impact productivity, comfort, and work quality. Understanding these differences becomes essential when your living space doubles as your workplace.\n\nThe Case for Laptop Flexibility\n\nLaptops have emerged as the Swiss Army knives of remote work. Their portability transforms any corner of your home into a potential workspace, from the kitchen table during breakfast to the comfort of your couch in the evening. This flexibility proves invaluable when household dynamics demand adaptability, whether you’re avoiding renovation noise or seeking better natural light throughout the day.\n\nModern laptops pack impressive processing power into remarkably slim profiles. Current generation processors from Intel and AMD deliver performance that rivals many desktop configurations, particularly for standard office tasks like video conferencing, document processing, and web-based applications.\n\nFor professionals who split time between home and occasional office visits, or those who travel regularly, a laptop maintains consistency across different work environments. The ability to work from virtually anywhere has become particularly valuable, whether you’re collaborating at a coffee shop, catching up on emails during lunch, or even taking a quick break to play at an online casino during your downtime, all from the same device you use for professional tasks.\n\nDesktop Dominance in Performance\n\nStationary PCs continue to reign supreme when raw performance matters most. The freedom from size and thermal constraints allows desktop systems to accommodate more powerful processors, dedicated graphics cards, and extensive cooling solutions. Video editors, software developers, and data analysts often find that desktop systems handle resource-intensive tasks with greater efficiency and stability.\n\nCustomization represents another significant advantage of desktop computing. Components can be individually selected, upgraded, or replaced as needs evolve or technology advances. A graphics card upgrade might extend a desktop’s useful life by several years, while laptop users typically face the choice of complete replacement when performance falls behind requirements.\n\nThe ergonomic benefits of desktop setups deserve serious consideration. Full-sized mechanical keyboards , precision mice, and adjustable monitor stands promote better posture and reduce strain during extended work sessions. Multiple large displays, easily supported by desktop systems, enhance multitasking capabilities and reduce the constant window switching that hampers productivity on smaller screens.\n\nFinancial Considerations Beyond Initial Cost\n\nComparisons of laptop and desktop prices reveal interesting patterns. Entry-level desktops generally offer superior specifications for the same investment as comparable laptops. A thousand-dollar desktop typically features faster processors, more storage, and superior graphics capabilities compared to a laptop at the same price point.\n\nLong-term costs tell a different story. Desktop systems, with their modular nature, allow incremental upgrades that extend operational lifespan. Replacing a failing hard drive or adding memory costs a fraction of purchasing a new system. Laptop repairs, conversely, often approach or exceed the value of the device itself, particularly for older models where parts become scarce.\n\nMaking the Right Choice\n\nThe optimal choice between a laptop and a desktop ultimately depends on individual work patterns and priorities. Creative professionals handling large files or running demanding applications often benefit from desktop power and expandability. Writers, consultants, and administrative professionals might find laptop portability aligns better with their workflow needs.\n\nFuture flexibility matters too. Remote work situations evolve, and what works today might prove limiting tomorrow. Some professionals find success with hybrid approaches, using powerful desktops for intensive work while maintaining lightweight laptops for meetings and mobile tasks. Others invest in high-end laptops with docking stations, achieving desktop-like functionality when needed while preserving portability options.",

      "content": "Key Takeaways Micron shares were little changed in premarket trading Wednesday after the memory chip maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and issued a rosy forecast amid surging AI-related demand.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s trading session, investors should watch out for a potential breakout above a recently formed pennant pattern, a move that would indicate a continuation of the stock's strong uptrend.\n\nBars pattern analysis projects a potential upside target on Micron's chart around $240, while key support levels sit near $155 and $129.\n\nMicron (MU) shares were little changed in premarket trading Wednesday after the memory chip maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and issued a rosy forecast amid surging AI-related demand.\n\nThe company said late Tuesday it expects to generate fiscal first-quarter revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in well ahead of the $11.94 billion expected by analysts, with the guidance driven by booming demand for the company’s high-bandwidth memory chips and favorable pricing dynamics.\n\nHeading into the earnings report, the Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares had nearly doubled since the start of the year and surged 40% in September. The gains have been fueled by customers investing billions in AI chips to build data centers tasked with powering increasingly memory-intensive applications. The stock was down 0.2% at around $166 in recent premarket trading.\n\nBelow, we use technical analysis to identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for.\n\nPennant Pattern in Focus\n\nAfter finding support near the 50-day moving average, Micron shares trended sharply higher before consolidating in a pennant pattern over the past week.\n\nWhile this month’s strong uptrend has coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below its June peak, signaling that the stock has further room to climb.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s trading session, it’s worth watching out for a breakout above the pennant, a move that would indicate a continuation of the recent bullish move.\n\nLet’s turn to Micron’s chart to forecast an upside price target and also identify important support levels amid the possibility for earnings-related volatility.\n\nChart-Based Upside Price Target\n\nIf a post-earnings breakout move occurs, investors can use bars pattern analysis to project an upside target.\n\nWhen applying the technique to Micron’s chart, we take the price bars comprising the strong move higher this month and reposition them from the pennant pattern’s top trendline. This forecasts a target of around $240, 44% above Tuesday’s closing price.\n\nWe selected this earlier trend to predict how a continuation move higher may play out on the chart if the stock has a similar bullish upward leg.\n\nImportant Support Levels Worth Monitoring\n\nDuring retracements in the stock, investors should initially keep a close eye on the $155 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the pennant pattern and a brief pause in the stock’s strong uptrend earlier this month.\n\nFinally, selling below this level could spark a fall toward $129. Investors may seek to accumulate Micron shares in this location near the June and August peaks, which currently sit just above the upward sloping 50-day MA.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

      "content": "With all major phone launches over for 2025, it is time to see what the next year has to offer. Qualcomm just presented its top-of-the-line mobile processor for 2026 during its Snapdragon Summit keynote: The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is expected to power the flagship phones for next year, and the company even claims it is the “world’s fastest mobile system-on-a-chip”. But how can they say that?\n\nWith MediaTek timing its 2026 flagship SoC launch right before the Snapdragon Summit, we now know the details of the two main chips powering the fastest Android phones next year—unless Samsung surprises with its rumored Exynos 2600.\n\nFor the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, Qualcomm highlights two main improvements: faster multitasking/app switching and longer gameplay sessions with better power efficiency. A welcome change after years of companies launching products that talked about AI and features not yet ready for consumers…\n\nQualcomm\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 MediaTek\n\nDimensity 9500 Qualcomm\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite Samsung\n\nExynos 2500 Google Tensor G5 MediaTek\n\nDimensity 9400 Apple A19 Pro Apple A19 Prime core 2x Oryon @ 4.6 GHz 1x ARM C1-Ultra @ 4.21 GHz 2x Oryon @ 4.32 GHz 1x Cortex-X925 @ 3.3 GHz 1x Cortex -X4 @ 3.78 GHz 1x Cortex-X925 @ 3.62 GHz 2x Apple @ 4.26 GHz 2x Apple @ 4.26 GHz Performance core 6x Oryon @ 3.62 GHz 3x ARM C1-Premium @ 3.5 GHz 4x Oryon @ 3.53 GHz 2x Cortex-A725 @ 2.75 GHZ\n\n5x Cortex-A725 @ 2.36 GHz 5x Cortex-A725 @ 3.05 GHz 3x Cortex-X4 @ 3.3 GHz Efficiency core 4x ARM C1-Pro @ 2.7 GHz 2x Cortex-A520 @ 1.8 GHz 2x Cortex-A520 @ 2.25 GHz 4x Cortex-A720 @ 2.4 GHz 4x Apple @ 2.60 GHz 4x Apple @ 2.60 GHz RAM LPDDR5x-10600\n\n4x 16-bit @ 5300 MHz (84.8 GB/s) LPDDR5x-10667\n\n4x 16-bit @ 5333 MHz (85.4 GB/s) LPDDR5x-10600\n\n4x 16-bit @ 5300 MHz (84.8 GB/s) LPDDR5x LPDDR5x LPDDR5x-10667\n\n4x 16-bit @ 5333 MHz (85.4 GB/s) LPDDR5x-9600\n\n4x 16-bit @ 4800 MHz\n\n(75.8 GB/s) LPDDR5x-8533\n\n4x 16-bit @ 4266 MHz\n\n(68.2 GB/s) GPU Adreno @ 1.2 GHz 12x ARM Mali G1-Ultra @ 1.7 GHz\n\n(5271 GFLOPs) Adreno 830 @ 1.1 GHz\n\n(3379 GFLOPs) AMD Radeon RDNA2 @ 1 GHz\n\n(4091 GFLOPs) PowerVR DXT-48-1536\n\n(1536 GFLOPs) 12x ARM Immortalis-G925 @ 1.6 GHz\n\n(4952 GFLOPs) 6x Apple GPU 5x Apple GPU 5G modem Snapdragon X85\n\n(12.5/3.7 Gbps) MediaTek Snapdragon X80\n\n(10/3.5 Gbps) Exynos\n\n(12.1/3.6 Gbps) Exynos 5400i MediaTek\n\n(7/3.5 Gbps) External Snapdragon External Snapdragon Connectivity FastConnect 7900\n\nWi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 6.0\n\nUWB Wi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 6.0 FastConnect 7900\n\nWi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 6.0\n\nUWB Wi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 5.4 Wi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 6.0 Wi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 5.4 Apple N1\n\nWi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 6\n\nThread Apple N1\n\nWi-Fi 7\n\nBluetooth 6\n\nThread Process node TSMC N3P TSMC N3P TSMC N3E Samsung 3GAP TSMC N3 TSMC N3E TSMC N3P TSMC N3P\n\nNew CPU for Better Performance\n\nQualcomm’s claims of best mobile performance come from its new, third-generation Oryon CPU core. The previous-generation chip already surprised us with its fast clock speeds, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 takes frequencies even further, clocking its two prime cores at up to 4.6 GHz, while the remaining 6 CPU cores can reach 3.62 GHz. RAM support is unchanged, offering LPDDR5x-10600, which strikes a good balance between power consumption and performance.\n\nThe company estimates a 20% performance increase, with 35% better power efficiency on the CPU alone. There is, of course, a new Adreno GPU, with 23% better graphics performance.\n\nFrom the looks of it, it seems that Qualcomm is claiming to have the “fastest mobile CPU” simply based on the fact that it clocks the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 higher than its competitors. Both MediaTek and Apple reach 4.2 GHz on their recent premium mobile chips, which are lower-clocked than the first-generation Snapdragon 8 Elite.\n\nThe new chip is expected to be used by all major phone brands. / © Qualcomm\n\nBetter photos and videos\n\nThe image processor on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 boasts a 4x improvement in dynamic range, promising better low-light photography and more realistic colors. For content creators, Qualcomm included support for the Advanced Professional Video (APV) format, which is roughly Android’s answer to Apple’s ProRes codec. In practice, APV offers better image quality video with better support for processing in the popular DaVinci Resolve video editor, for example.\n\nQualcomm also announced a partnership with the video specialists at ArcSoft to integrate AI features into video processing, exclusively for the new Snapdragon. It aims to achieve better color reproduction, contrast, and shadow detail, mirroring the evolution of computational photography for video recording. It remains to be seen if this new feature will require special work from phone makers or will be automatically integrated into all Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 phones.\n\nFaster Snapdragon 5G\n\nThe integrated Snapdragon X85 modem was also upgraded, after a few generations with only small upgrades. Cellular connections on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 can reach up to 12.5 Gbps (compared to 10 in the previous model), and uploads also got a small upgrade from 3.5 to 3.7 Gbps. Of course, those numbers are for theoretical uplink/downlink, and real-world numbers will be much lower.\n\nSupport for other wireless standards remains the same as in the original Snapdragon 8 Elite, with the FastConnect 7900 core offering Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB).\n\n“Coming soon”\n\nQualcomm announced that phones powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 will be “launched in the coming days”. The list of brands that will offer phones with the new chip includes basically everyone: Asus ROG, Honor, Oppo/OnePlus, Realme, Samsung, Sony, Vivo/Iqoo, Xiaomi/Redmi/Poco, and ZTE/Nubia/RedMagic.",

      "content": "Chromebooks have been around for almost 15 years, and since their launch, they've made some noble attempts to evolve into something beyond just a super cheap laptop for students. It's been a difficult image for Google to shake, despite its successes in turning Android into a more premium brand over the years.\n\nHaving tested the best Chromebooks and Windows laptops across the spectrum in price, I'm constantly evaluating where Chromebooks are today and if they're worth it, student or not. Here's everything you need to know about how they compare to Windows laptops in the market.\n\nWhat Chromebooks Can and Can’t Do\n\nOn the surface, Windows laptops and Chromebooks look quite similar. Chromebooks are laptops that come in a variety of sizes, from 13- and 16-inch clamshells to 11-inch tablets. There isn’t nearly as much variety as you’ll find in the Windows ecosystem, which includes categories like gaming laptops, but there's a surprising amount of variety in the Chromebook space. When in doubt, you’ll find the “Chrome” badge on the lid of all Chromebooks, which is the dead giveaway.\n\nSoftware is where things diverge significantly. We’re all familiar with Microsoft’s trusty Windows, but Chromebooks run on Google’s ChromeOS operating system. First announced in 2009, it represents the third primary option to Windows and macOS (outside of Linux). As it’s often been called, ChromeOS remains a glorified Chrome web browser. Everything you can do in a web browser on a MacBook or Windows laptop can be done on a Chromebook.\n\nYou can have dozens of tabs, you can access extensions, and you can use any web app you need. For many people, this represents the majority of what they do on those laptops anyway. It also has a conventional file system, an app drawer, a desktop, and a lot of the other elements you’d be familiar with coming from Windows or Mac.",

The update brings official framework support to Radeon RX 9000 (RDNA 4) and RX 7000 (RDNA 3) GPUs, as well as to select Ryzen AI 300 \"Strix\" and Ryzen AI MAX \"Strix Halo\" APUs, fulfilling a promise AMD made at Computex 2025 to make ROCm more cross-platform and developer-friendly. \"At Computex this year, I shared our commitment to making ROCm a true cross-platform, developer-first stack. I said we'd bring ROCm to Radeon on Windows and Linux in the second half of 2025. I'm proud to say that today, we're delivering on that promise,\" says Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President and Chief Software Officer.For Windows users, this is a genuine quality-of-life change: no more dual-booting, convoluted workarounds, or constant reliance on cloud instances to test and run AI models locally. AMD describes the release as a foundation rather than a finished product. The preview provides native PyTorch wheels, allowing developers to prototype, benchmark, and provide feedback while AMD iterates on performance and feature coverage. The company positions this step as part of a broader effort to extend ROCm beyond the data center and into the everyday machines of creators and developers. At the same time, enterprise customers continue to get higher-scale optimizations through the ROCm 7.0 family for Instinct and EPYC platforms.

      "headline": "Intel eyes Apple investment to fuel revival",
      "content": "After locking in a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and another $2 billion from SoftBank, Intel reportedly wants Apple as its next major backer.\n\nApple was once a long-time customer of Intel. However, it eventually shifted to its own in-house chips after Intel failed to innovate quickly enough.\n\nIntel begs Apple for money\n\nIntel once dominated the CPU market, but the last decade tells a different story. The chipmaker has struggled to deliver meaningful breakthroughs in computing performance, while smaller rival AMD has surged ahead in both power and efficiency. As a result, longtime partners and vendors have begun looking elsewhere, frustrated by Intel’s stagnation.\n\nAll this has affected Intel’s bottom line, forcing the company to reduce its spending significantly. Earlier this year, it cut 15% of its workforce to save money. Even the U.S. government picked up a 10% stake in the chipmaker last month. Now, fresh after securing a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, Intel is seeking a big investment from Apple.\n\nAs Bloomberg reports, both companies are in the early stages of negotiations, with Apple not committing to anything yet. They have also discussed how they can work together more closely.\n\nGiven the strained history between the two companies, it would be interesting to see if Apple makes any investment commitment to Intel. And even if it does, there’s no chance Apple would go back to using Intel chips in its devices.\n\nIntel needs more than money to survive\n\nApple executives previously explained in detail why they moved away from Intel to Apple silicon for their products. The decision paid off, with Apple silicon-powered Macs setting a new benchmark in performance and efficiency.\n\nIntel CPUs, meanwhile, failed to keep pace with the rapid progress of Apple’s chips. The chips often face criticism for excessive power consumption and underwhelming year-over-year performance improvements. This widening gap between Intel chips and Apple silicon has only reinforced Cupertino’s decision to cut ties and chart its own roadmap.\n\nBeyond CPUs, Intel also supplied Apple with baseband chips for iPhones. However, Intel’s failure to deliver a 5G modem on schedule forced Apple to strike a multiyear licensing deal with Qualcomm (after settling a legal dispute). Following this failure, Intel sold its modem business to Apple for $1 billion and exited the baseband market entirely.\n\nEven if Intel lands an investment from Apple, it won’t be enough to end the chipmaker’s troubles. What the company needs is to spend that money wisely and get back to innovating.",

      "headline": "How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for free today",
      "content": "BrasilNut1/iStock/Getty Images Plus\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nZDNET's key takeaways\n\nMost PCs from the last 15 years can run Windows 11, even if they fail compatability.\n\nPCs sold with Windows 10 can usually upgrade after a quick registry edit.\n\nOn older or unusually configured PCs, a third-party utility gets the job done.\n\nOn Oct. 14, 2025, Microsoft will stop delivering security updates to your Windows 10 PC unless you enroll that PC in the Extended Security Updates program.\n\nIf you try to upgrade to Windows 11 on a PC that's more than five or six years old, you'll probably encounter an error message telling you -- in no uncertain terms -- that your old PC doesn't qualify because its CPU isn't on the official list of compatible processors. Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.\n\nAlso: How to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026\n\nThat might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.\n\nThose pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as hundreds of ZDNET readers have reported this year alone, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.\n\nAlso: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options - and 3 weeks to act\n\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.\n\nThese instructions also assume that you have a PC with an x64 CPU (not ARM and not 32-bit), running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro), and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.\n\nWhich option should you choose?\n\nPlease don't skip over this section.\n\nThis article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.\n\nIt must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.\n\nSecure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)\n\nA TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.\n\nTo check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says \"Legacy,\" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.\n\nTo see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says \"Compatible TPM cannot be found.\"\n\nIf you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.\n\nFinally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.\"\n\nAlso: Microsoft said these 400 readers couldn't upgrade to Windows 11. They did it anyway\n\nIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.\n\nWant to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.\n\nOption 1: Use this simple registry edit\n\nWith this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.\n\nThis process requires four steps.\n\n1. Change one key in the Windows registry You need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding. Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\MoSetup If the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter. Also: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data Select the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!) Replace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the \"Value data\" box to 1. The result should look like this: Show more\n\nUse this registry tweak to override the Windows 11 CPU compatibility check. You must have a TPM (any version) and Secure Boot must be enabled. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nCheck for errors before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, or if you create the required value in the wrong location, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.\n\n2. Download the Windows 11 ISO On the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder. Note that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while. Also: Your complete Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything to know - before you ditch Windows 10 For those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, you might run into problems during the installation process. The default download is English (United States) but you also have the option to choose English (International) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing the wrong language results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files. If that happens, back out of the upgrade, download the other language option, and try again. Show more\n\n3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer After the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter. Show more\n\n4. Run Windows Setup In File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues. Also: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it If you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install). One last piece of advice: Watch carefully at the beginning of Setup for an option labeled \"Change how setup downloads updates.\" To increase your chances of a successful upgrade, click that link and choose the \"Not right now\" option. That should allow Windows Setup to finish faster -- you'll have a chance to download those updates after the upgrade is complete. Show more\n\nIf you encounter any difficulties or if the upgrade fails, check this article for detailed advice on what to do to find and fix the problem: Windows 11 upgrade failed? These are my 4 most powerful troubleshooting secrets\n\nOption 2: Use the free Rufus utility\n\nOn older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot and UEFI, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. It is technically possible to do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.\n\nTo get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done.\" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.\n\nIf you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)\n\nAlso: You can still upgrade old PCs to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no: Readers prove it\n\nTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO from aka.ms/DownloadWindows11. Choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!\n\nDownload Rufus from the developer's site or from the Microsoft Store and run the app. In Rufus, choose the USB drive and then choose the \"Disk or ISO image\" option. Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier (hint: it's in your Downloads folder), and then click Start. In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below. Adjust any other settings as you prefer. Click OK to accept those changes and then click Start to begin creating the bootable installation drive.\n\nBe sure to choose the top checkbox here to bypass the compatibility check for the Windows 11 upgrade. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.\n\nSeveral readers have reported that Setup failed prematurely and displayed an error message (\"An unsupported operation was attempted\") when run from media created using Windows 11 version 24H2 and the latest version of Rufus. The fix? Watch carefully at the beginning of Setup for an option labeled \"Change how setup downloads updates.\" Click that link and choose the \"Not right now\" option, as shown here. That should allow setup to continue without interruption.\n\nIf Setup quits unexpectedly with an error message, try again but choose this option insted. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\n\nAlso: Consumer Reports slams Microsoft for Windows 10 mess, urges extension of free updates\n\nMy ZDNET colleague Lance Whitney has more details on the other options available with Rufus in \"How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions).\"\n\nDid your upgrade work?\n\nIf you've tried this upgrade, I want to hear about your experience. If it worked, please share the details. If you run into snags, send me an email so we can figure out what's going wrong.\n\nBe sure to include details -- the make and model of your PC and screenshots of any error messages. If you're able to create a report using the SetupDiag utility, please include that as well -- you'll find detailed instructions in my Windows 11 upgrade troubleshooting guide.

      "content": "Asus has revealed that pre-orders for the ROG Xbox Ally handheld will drop today. The post does not mention the ROG Xbox Ally X so it could be that the more-powerful handheld will be available later for pre-order.\n\n4 Reviews ← exclude selected types\n\nEver since the announcement of the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, rumors about pricing and pre-orders have been circulating online. Microsoft and Asus have confirmed that both the devices will launch on October 16 but till now, there was no information on pre-orders. Turns out, they are almost here.\n\nAsus has teased on Facebook that pre-orders for the ROG Xbox Ally are “dropping soon.” There is a countdown that ends at 8 PM ET / 5 PM PT today (September 25). So, in a few hours, those who are interested in the new handhelds will be able to reserve their units and pricing will be revealed to the public. The post mentions the white ROG Xbox Ally but not the ROG Xbox Ally X so it is possible that pre-orders for the more powerful variant will start a day or two later.\n\nThe Facebook post was spotted by The Verge but it doesn’t seem to be available on Asus ROG’s US account. The Singapore account, however, does have the post in the form of a story.\n\nRumors and leaks have hinted at the pricing for the two handhelds. Last month, it was reported that the ROG Xbox Ally is priced between $500 and $600. Best Buy, however, briefly posted a $550 price tag for the lower-end model and $900 for the Xbox ROG Ally X. More recently, a UK retailer’s leaked promotional material had the non-X model listed for £500 (approx. $667 USD).\n\nRegardless, we should get official confirmation soon. The ROG Xbox Ally is powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2A and a 60Wh battery while the ROG Xbox Ally X is powered by the Ryzen Z2 Extreme with an 80Wh battery. Both come with a 7‑inch 1080p/120Hz 500‑nit display and dual USB Type‑C ports.",

      "headline": "4 key takeaways from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii: New smartphone and laptop Chips, 6G, and Google’s PC comeback",
      "content": "At this year’s Snapdragon Summit, the story went well beyond the new processors that Qualcomm announces every year in Maui, Hawaii. It was refreshing to see how Qualcomm placed the ecosystem at the center, putting its technologies at the heart of the products that will begin reaching the market in the days and months ahead.\n\nOf course, we learned about the latest chip, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which will power upcoming flagship Android smartphones, as well as brand-new computing chips set to arrive in the next generation of PCs. However, it was Google’s confirmation that Android and ChromeOS will merge to create a new Operating System for computers next year that stole the limelight, and for good reason. That’s a lot to unpack, all things considered.\n\nIn case you missed out catching the livestream or you want to rewatch one of the biggest announcements from the event, here’s a refresher from the Snapdragon Summit (including my takeaways from the event)\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nA new flagship smartphone chip\n\nQualcomm’s bread and butter remains developing mobile processors for smartphones, including a critical component of a smartphone’s inner workings: the processor, or the “brain” of the phone – along with associated technologies like the modem. After all, these are the biggest revenue generators for the San Diego-based company. As expected at the Snapdragon Summit, Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, the processor that will power upcoming Android flagship phones, with Samsung, Xiaomi, Honor, and OnePlus leading the first wave of devices built around the new chip.\n\nQualcomm claims its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is the “fastest mobile CPU in the world,” boasting a record clock speed of 4.6 GHz (compared to Apple’s A19 Pro, which powers the iPhone 17 Pro Max, at 4.26 GHz). The company touts significant performance gains, including a 23 per cent faster GPU and a 37 per cent faster NPU. Whether these claims hold up will be determined once review units arrive, but a faster GPU could have an especially big impact on mobile gaming.\n\nA Qualcomm executive presents performance benchmarks for creator tools at the Snapdragon Summit 2025, highlighting up to 64 per cent faster CPU performance and 45 per cent faster photo effects with the new Snapdragon X2 Elite chip. (Image: Anuj Bhatia/The Indian Express) A Qualcomm executive presents performance benchmarks for creator tools at the Snapdragon Summit 2025, highlighting up to 64 per cent faster CPU performance and 45 per cent faster photo effects with the new Snapdragon X2 Elite chip. (Image: Anuj Bhatia/The Indian Express)\n\nLike Apple, Qualcomm also claims its new mobile processor brings speed improvements to a phone’s performance. However, there are three particularly interesting aspects of the new chip that haven’t been highlighted. One of them is Qualcomm’s Personal Scribe – an agentic AI assistant powered by the new Sensing Hub that learns your habits to make recommendations and act on your behalf. Deeply integrated at the chip level, the assistant delivers a highly personalised experience. It will be interesting to see how smartphone brands implement this feature, which learns about your behaviour and operates across your apps and services.\n\nAnother highlight of the new Snapdragon chip is how Qualcomm is going after the creator market with an advanced video recording feature in the Professional Video Codec, bringing crisp HDR footage that’s easier to edit without quality loss. While each smartphone maker does a lot of finetuning to the camera, this new chip-level feature offers a recording feature that’s aimed at content creators. The “near-lossless” codec, created in partnership with Samsung, is an answer to Apple’s ProRes format.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe new mobile chip also includes Snapdragon Audio Sense, a microphone technology with wind noise rejection, audio zoom, and HDR audio, enabling 24-bit audio recording in any environment without needing external microphones.\n\nAlso Read | As Qualcomm unveils new AI Chips for smartphones and laptops, CEO Cristiano Amon sets course to make company an ecosystem player\n\nWhile the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 remains a flagship processor, Qualcomm pulled a surprise by announcing a second premium-tier processor. Details are limited for now, but the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 will sit below the flagship model. The strategy mirrors Apple’s two-chip iPhone approach: offering two mobile chips, with the latter expanding on the premium smartphone experience at a slightly lower price.\n\nNew chips like these are critical for a company like Qualcomm to stay competitive. Although competition from MediaTek and Apple is getting stiff, smartphones still remain the de facto centerpiece of the incumbent ecosystem. Qualcomm may already be talking about agentic AI and AI assistants that could one day replace apps, and eventually, smartphones might no longer be central, potentially giving way to smart glasses. Truth be told, phones aren’t going anywhere, at least for now. While the longevity of smartphones is increasing and fewer consumers are willing to replace their phones every year as they used to, smartphones are not likely to be replaced by smart glasses anytime soon.\n\nBeefier computing chips, with a focus on business customers\n\nAlthough Qualcomm is still a new player in the PC market, it aims to compete with veteran players like Intel and AMD, as well as Apple, which designs its own M-series chips for Mac computers. The company’s newly announced X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips, which will appear in some of the top laptops and other PCs over the next year, are powerful, with the latter processor reaching clock speeds of up to 5 GHz. The new processors feature the third-generation Oryon CPU with up to 18 cores – six more than their predecessors. Qualcomm’s big bet with these processors is that by distributing workloads across the CPU, GPU, and NPU, power consumption will be optimized without any drop in performance.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nQualcomm’s X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips take on PC processors from Intel, AMD and Apple. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/ Qualcomm’s X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips take on PC processors from Intel, AMD and Apple. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/ Indian Express\n\nThese chips also lean heavily on AI, bringing multimodal content generation and agentic AI to the forefront. In fact, the X2 Elite can deliver up to 80 TOPS of AI processing, enabling the most advanced Windows-powered Copilot Plus PCs. Meanwhile, Qualcomm’s partnership with Adobe, which offers a creative suite of apps including Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro, means laptops powered by the new chips will deliver up to 47 per cent faster performance.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm’s new PC chips support lightning-fast 5G with speeds up to 10 Gbps, a major advantage for connectivity. The focus on PC gaming also promises faster performance and smoother graphics, allowing demanding games to run seamlessly. The big takeaway is that Qualcomm is gradually targeting enterprises and business (and even PC gamers) users with these new chips, which will power some of the best and fastest Windows laptops starting next year.\n\nQualcomm promises “pre-commercial 6G devices” will be here in three years\n\n5G is everywhere. Maybe it’s no longer talked about much, but a few years ago, it was the most buzzed-about technology. Similarly, we may start hearing a lot about 6G, the new wireless connectivity standard, in the coming months. Qualcomm says 6G is coming soon and will eventually replace 5G. You might be wondering what 6G actually means. Sure, it will be super fast and increase network speeds, but it’s expected to be very different from 5G – at least in terms of use cases.\n\nDuring the Snapdragon Summit keynote, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon drew attention to 6G, the next-gen connectivity standard. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express) During the Snapdragon Summit keynote, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon drew attention to 6G, the next-gen connectivity standard. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express)\n\nDuring the Snapdragon Summit keynote, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said, “6G is designed to be the connection between the cloud and edge devices.” What does that mean? Amon explains that it will be “a network intelligent enough to perceive sensor data.” He implies that a new level of connectivity is needed for a world where AI must process sensor data at the edge, whether from your phone or a pair of smart glasses, and then train on that data from the real world around you. Amon adds that 6G will focus on “connecting the edge and the cloud, merging not only the physical and digital, but also creating entirely new experiences.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAmon further predicted that the change is already underway. “We are ready to have pre-commercial devices as early as 2028. When that happens, we have context-aware intelligence at scale – and it’s going to happen everywhere.” Expect to hear more about 6G early next year.\n\nGoogle’s comeback into the PC market\n\nChromeOS is dead, whether Google admits it or not. Nor is Android a replacement for ChromeOS. Perhaps Google has a solution to this problem… why not merge Android and ChromeOS? Well, that’s going to happen next year. Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of platforms and devices at Google, and Android chief Samir Samant both took the stage at this week’s Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii to confirm that Android for PC is coming next year.\n\nGoogle’s Sameer Samat explains the next chapter for Android and ChromeOS. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express) Google’s Sameer Samat explains the next chapter for Android and ChromeOS. (Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express)\n\nOsterloh, who oversees both Google’s hardware and Android divisions, shared some details about the project. “We’re building together a technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems,” he said. “This is another way we can leverage all of the great work we are doing on our AI stack, our full stack, bringing Gemini models, the Assistant, and our applications and developer community into the PC domain.”\n\nExactly how the combined OS will look is still unknown, but Qualcomm’s involvement indicates that both companies are up to something. It’s just that neither is ready to share more details.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“If you think about the laptop form factor, we have had ChromeOS for a long time, and we are super committed to that platform. It’s been really successful for us, and we have learned a lot from it. We also have Android tablets that have been very successful; they are becoming more productivity-focused all the time. So the opportunity we see is how we can accelerate all the AI advancements we are doing on Android and bring them to the laptop form factor as rapidly as possible, while ensuring the laptop and the rest of the Android ecosystem work seamlessly together,” Samant said about merging Android and ChromeOS at the Snapdragon Summit.\n\n“So what we are doing is basically taking the ChromeOS experience and re-baselining the technology underneath it on Android. That combination is something we’re very excited about for next year, and we are working with partners on it, and we can’t wait.”\n\nChromeOS has long been a lightweight OS for computers and laptops. The OS has seen many changes over the years, but it has sadly never evolved to become something like Windows or macOS. However, with Google going all-in on Gemini, it may bring new experiences to the company’s big-screen OS, giving it a clear purpose in the AI-ready world.",

      "headline": "Intel Seeks Investment from Apple to Bolster Turnaround Bid",
      "content": "Intel has reportedly approached Apple about securing an investment in the ailing chipmaker as part of efforts to strengthen a business that is now partially owned by the U.S. government.\n\nBloomberg reports that Intel has reached out to Apple to discuss the possibility of an investment in the struggling chipmaker. According to sources close to the matter, who wished to remain anonymous due to the private nature of the discussions, Intel is seeking to secure funding from Apple as part of its ongoing turnaround efforts, which have been bolstered by partial U.S. government ownership.\n\nThe talks between the two tech giants have also included discussions on how they can work more closely together, although the exact nature of this potential collaboration remains unclear. While the negotiations are still in the early stages and may not result in a finalized agreement, the news has already had a significant impact on Intel’s stock, which rose 6.4 percent to $31.22 on Wednesday following the initial reports.\n\nThis potential deal with Apple follows a series of investments in Intel from other major players in the tech industry. Last week, Nvidia Corp. announced a $5 billion investment in the chipmaker, with plans to work together on chips for personal computers and data centers. Additionally, SoftBank Group Corp., the Japanese tech giant looking to expand its presence in the U.S., revealed a $2 billion investment in Intel last month.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported on the Nvidia investment:\n\nThe deal is not just about capital. Nvidia and Intel have agreed to jointly develop new products for data centers and personal computing, leveraging each company’s strengths. Intel will manufacture Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs, which Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms. Additionally, Intel will build chip systems for Nvidia chiplets, the modular components that power next-generation PCs. This collaboration is expected to expand both companies’ ecosystems and lay the groundwork for what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls “the next era of computing.”\n\nDespite these investments and the backing of the federal government, Intel still faces significant challenges in its bid to regain its former dominance in the semiconductor industry. The company has lost its long-held technological edge and market share to competitors such as AMD. Furthermore, Intel has struggled to capitalize on the growing demand for AI hardware, a market in which Nvidia has dominated.\n\nUnder the leadership of CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Intel is attempting to turn the tide and reclaim its position as a leading chipmaker. The company has pursued a strategy of becoming a chip foundry, producing semiconductors for external clients. However, securing enough customers to support its factory expansion plans has proven difficult.\n\nIntel’s turnaround began with the Trump administration taking an equity stake in the company in exchange for CHIPS act funding. As Breitbart News reported:\n\nTrump has pursued government investment in semiconductors and rare earth materials, which includes a stake in chipmaker Nvidia and MP Materials. “We should get an equity stake for our money,” Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick said this week. “So we’ll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We’ll get equity in return for it.”\n\nRead more at Bloomberg here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.",

      "content": "Snapdragon-powered laptops haven’t made a huge splash in the PC world—or here at PCWorld—perhaps because they’re just too expensive without a ton of extra functionality versus AMD or Intel machines. But what if you could get one for under $500? Such is the case with this HP refurbished model, which is on sale for $439 on eBay right now.\n\nWhen PCWorld reviewed the HP OmniBook X AI 14 last year, Mark Knapp called it “a fine laptop offering excellent battery life,” but noted that it wasn’t worth its $1,200 asking price. But now, at just over a third of that, it looks a lot more appealing. The 14-inch 2240×1400 touchscreen is excellent and the Snapdragon X Elite processor is an upgrade over most other Qualcomm-based laptops in this price range. 16GB of RAM (the lowest I’d recommend for Windows 11) and 1TB of storage are nice, too.\n\nAt 2.95 pounds, this OmniBook is on the lighter side, especially considering the 59 watt-hour battery that can outlast bigger and more powerful designs with 18 hours of video playback. (Expect less battery life for regular work, but still more than enough to get you through an untethered work day.) The only real downside I can find with the design, other than Snapdragon’s poor gaming performance, is a lack of ports—you get only two USB-C and one USB-A on this ultra-thin design.\n\nThe eBay seller is participating in the official “eBay refurbished” program and rates this laptop as “good.” That means “used,” to be frank, but the silver lining here is that it’s been refurbished by a professional shop and comes with a 1-year Allstate warranty—much better than the usual 90 days for a refurb. If that sours you on this particular deal, check out PCWorld’s roundup of the best laptops.\n\nSave 63% on this HP OmniBook X AI 14 with Snapdragon X Elite CPU",

      "headline": "Global and China Electronic Rearview Mirror Industry Report 2025: Commercial Vehicle CMS Gains Traction Faster, with Some Manufacturers' Cumulative Installation Volume Exceeding 10,000 Units",
      "content": "Dublin, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Global and China Electronic Rearview Mirror Industry Report, 2025\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nBased on the installation location, electronic rearview mirrors can be divided into electronic interior rearview mirrors (i.e., streaming media rearview mirrors) and electronic exterior rearview mirrors (Camera Mirror System, hereinafter referred to as CMS).\n\nStreaming Media Rearview Mirrors Witness Rapid Growth, with Yuanfeng Technology Leading in Sales for Eight Consecutive Years\n\nAccording to statistics from the database, in the whole year of 2024, the installations of streaming media rearview mirrors in China's passenger car pre-installation market reached 647,000 units, a year-on-year increase of 11.5%. From January to May 2025, the installations of streaming media rearview mirrors reached 383,000 units, with a year-on-year growth of 86.2%. In terms of installation rate, from January to May 2025, that of streaming media rearview mirrors also increased, rising from 2.8% in the whole year of 2024 to 4.5%.\n\nIn terms of equipped models, from January to May 2025, there were a total of 114 passenger car models in China that were equipped with streaming media rearview mirrors and had sales volume. Among them, many models of multiple brands began to be equipped with streaming media rearview mirrors as standard. For example, the streaming media rearview mirror products of many popular models such as Xpeng P7+ / X9 are all provided by Yuanfeng Technology.\n\nIn terms of supplier share, Yuanfeng Technology has accounted for more than 55% of the market share for eight consecutive years. From January to May 2025, the market share of Yuanfeng Technology's streaming media rearview mirrors reached 59.0%, and it is expected to exceed 70% for the whole year of 2025. At present, Yuanfeng Technology's supporting customers include more than 15 domestic and foreign brands such as several leading emerging OEMs (including Xpeng), SAIC-GM, Great Wall Motor, GAC Trumpchi, and Mercedes-Benz, and it has cooperated in the mass production of more than 60 vehicle models.\n\nAt present, Yuanfeng Technology's streaming media rearview mirror has developed to the fifth generation. This product adopts an extremely narrow-bezel design, which balances ultra-high display screen brightness and extremely low system latency. Moreover, the fifth-generation product applies an AI image optimization algorithm to achieve effects such as super-sensitive noise reduction, night vision enhancement, rain and fog penetration, and super-resolution. It breaks through the image quality limit of traditional ISP image processing and realizes continuous optimization through continuous iterative learning.\n\nPassenger Car CMS Transforms from Product Access to Product Upgrade\n\nIn terms of installations, CMS is still in a stage of slow growth. In 2024, there were only 5 passenger car models that were pre-installed with CMS and had sales volume. From January to May 2025, this number increased to 10. From July 2023, when CMS was approved for installation on vehicles, to May 2025, the cumulative assembly volume of CMS for passenger cars has not yet exceeded 10,000 units.\n\nCMS has now completed the process from scratch, and will gradually move towards the path of product iteration and upgrade in the future. From the perspective of the composition of CMS products, the future product upgrade may start from three aspects:\n\nCamera: Advancing from 2MP to 5MP, or Even 8MP\n\nAs the `eyes` of the CMS system, the most fundamental requirement of the system is to see clearly and see far. The pixel of CMS cameras is upgrading from the early 1.2 - 2MP to 5MP or even 8MP.\n\nAccording to the information disclosed by OFILM, it is currently developing 8MP CMS camera. Previously, OFILM launched a 2MP CMS camera with a heating function.\n\nAnother key technical indicator of the camera is HDR. To cope with extreme light change scenarios such as tunnel entrances and exits and strong night light, HDR has advanced from 120dB to 140dB. This ensures that images of the CMS system will not be overexposed or underexposed under any lighting conditions.\n\nDisplay Screen: Developing from LCD to OLED and Mini LED\n\nThe display screen serves as the observation window for users. Users' demand for high-quality displays may drive the development of CMS display screens from LCD to OLED and Mini LED. At present, LCD is still used in some vehicle models due to its cost advantage. However, OLED has become the first choice for mid-to high-end CMS solutions because of its high contrast, wide viewing angle, and fast response time. In addition, Mini LED is also a cost-effective option. Its higher brightness and more precise local dimming capability can better suppress night glare and provide a display effect close to that of OLED.\n\nSystem Upgrade\n\nRegulations and user experience requirements have jointly promoted the improvement of system-level performance indicators. For example, regulations require that the imaging time be less than 55ms, the system latency be less than 200ms, and the minimum system frame rate be at least 30Hz (at least 15Hz under low-light conditions). All these indicator requirements are to ensure the fluency and real-time performance of the picture and avoid misjudgment by drivers due to latency or stuttering. At present, the system latency of CMS products of most manufacturers has basically been controlled within 60ms, and some manufacturers have even achieved 40ms. In addition, the system must have a complete fault detection and alarm mechanism to deal with extreme failure scenarios such as `black screen` and `picture freezing` and ensure functional safety.\n\nYuanfeng Technology's CMS has a pixel of more than 3MP. The product provides three types of display screens for selection, namely LCD, Mini LED, and OLED. Moreover, the display screen supports touch adjustment of angle, brightness, color temperature, and other parameters. The system is equipped with functional safety guarantees such as LED flicker suppression, picture delay detection, and picture freezing detection to ensure driving safety.\n\nCommercial Vehicle CMS Gains Traction Faster, with Some Manufacturers' Cumulative Installation Volume Exceeding 10,000 Units\n\nCompared with passenger cars, the advantage effect of CMS in commercial vehicles is more obvious. Taking the MirrorCam applied in Mercedes-Benz trucks as an example, according to the actual test of Mercedes-Benz trucks, heavy trucks equipped with electronic rearview mirrors can reduce fuel consumption by 1.3% compared with models with traditional rearview mirrors. Assuming that a Mercedes-Benz truck has a fuel consumption of 28 liters per 100 kilometers, with a fuel price of 7 yuan per liter and an annual driving distance of 200,000 kilometers, the use of electronic rearview mirrors can save 5,096 yuan in fuel costs per year.

      "headline": "Trump's TikTok deal payment criticized as 'shake-down scheme' by experts",
      "content": "Trump's TikTok deal payment criticized as 'shakedown scheme' by experts\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration recently approached a coalition of U.S. investors set to take over TikTok's U.S. operations with an ask: Will the group make a payment to the federal government \"in the low billions,\" according to a person with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nThe response from the investors, which includes tech mogul Larry Ellison, the Murdochs and venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz, was an unequivocal yes.\n\n\"Not a single member balked,\" said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \"They see it as something of a finders' fee.\"\n\nWelcome to President Trump's new business agenda: extracting payments as if the federal government is brokering deals like a white-shoe consulting firm fueled by lucrative \"fees for service.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhether it's the U.S. taking 15% of Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China, the federal government securing a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel or the Trump administration reportedly seeking an equity stake in Lithium Americas as part of a government loan negotiation, the White House is on a campaign of squeezing businesses with few parallels in modern history.\n\n\"At a minimum, this now means there is a tax imposed on every major business transaction,\" said Luigi Zingales, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago. \"But even worse, businesses will no longer be focused on innovating and creating value and instead the whole game now is rent-seeking. It's all about ingratiating yourself with Trump.\"\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nAsked on Thursday about the multibillion-dollar fee expected to be tacked onto the TikTok deal, which was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, Trump was evasive.\n\n\"We're going to be announcing different things, but the U.S. comes out great,\" Trump said from the Oval Office.\n\ntoggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nTrump has been more direct about defending his administration's private business interventions, including after Intel agreed to sell a 10% stake of the company to the U.S. government following Trump's calls for its chief executive to resign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL,\" Trump posted last month.\n\nMany media companies capitulate to Trump pressure\n\nThis pattern has played out across media, where Trump's longtime war against news organizations has escalated into marshaling the might of the federal government to force concessions.\n\nThe parent companies for ABC and CBS both paid $16 million to settle lawsuits Trump lawsuits filed alleging mistreatment by the networks. The payments went to Trump's presidential library foundation and Trump's legal fees. Shortly after CBS' payment, federal regulators approved the sale of its parent company, Paramount, to Skydance Media, which is controlled by the Ellison family.\n\nMedia companies were already signaling their acquiescence to Trump before he won a second term.\n\nAhead of the election, the billionaire owners of The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times killed parallel editorial endorsements of Kamala Harris. They soon rewired their editorial pages to be less critical of Trump. Both owners — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for the Post and medical innovator Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong for the Los Angeles Times — have major business interests that hinge on decisions by federal officials.\n\nThen there is Jimmy Kimmel. Last week, Disney — which owns ABC — suspended the late-night host after Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr threatened action over Kimmel's remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After a public outcry, including from First Amendment scholars, Kimmel returned on Tuesday with the blessing of ABC and Disney.\n\ntoggle caption Michael Loccisano/Getty Images\n\nTrump lashed out at the network's reversal.\n\n\"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, writing in the same post: \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump allies landing deals sparks criticism of \"crony capitalism\"\n\nAmong those the Trump White House has lined up to take the reins of TikTok's U.S. operation are Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the controlling owners of Fox News, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFrom one view, it can be seen as recognition of the friendly coverage the president often receives from Fox and The Post.\n\nBut Trump and Murdoch have also been at odds. That strife was highlighted in July when Trump sued The Journal and Murdoch over the paper's reporting on the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Murdochs' role in the takeover of America's most popular video app is a remarkable victory for the family and follows a relationship that has at times been combative.\n\ntoggle caption Monica Schipper/Getty Images\n\n\"If you look at Fox News on the one hand and The Wall Street Journal editorial page on the other, I think it's very clear that Rupert Murdoch wants to have bets on every square on the roulette table,\" says Richard Tofel, who was the former assistant publisher of The Wall Street Journal prior to Murdoch's 2007 acquisition of the paper.\n\nBut most of the stakeholders in the TikTok investment group are business leaders who have shown sustained loyalty to the president, which makes the deal look like a reward for fealty, Tofel says.\n\n\"There is a growing set of examples of crony capitalism that the Trump administration is putting into place across this country,\" says Tofel, a lawyer who later went on to become president of the nonprofit investigative news site ProPublica. \"American industry — which would have regarded this behavior from a Democrat as anathema and inconsistent with the tenets of unfettered capitalism — is rolling over for it time after time.\"\n\nExperts say U.S. economy being undermined by \"shakedown schemes\"\n\nThe exact template has varied. In the case of TikTok, the administration is seeking a fee for service. With Intel, the federal government is acquiring an equity stake. For chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, the demand was for a slice of future profits. And with the network television settlements, the payouts arose after personal legal disputes.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"There is no consistent principle at play, just the exercise of Trump's personal power over other people's money,\" said Dael Norwood, associate professor of history at the University of Delaware, who notes that the winners and losers are clear.\n\n\"All Americans — taxpayers, investors, customers, and workers — lose with crony capitalism,\" he said. \"It increases everyone's costs, makes everyone more vulnerable to extortion (or worse), and profoundly degrades our expectations for honesty and fair dealing, society-wide.\"\n\nIn public, corporate executives show support to the president and appear to back such deals, but behind closed doors, some business leaders are expressing deep concern.\n\nYale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld recently helped organize a gathering of more than 100 top CEOs, and he said there was near-unanimous consensus in surveys conducted at the event that Trump's interventions in private business are undermining America's free market principles.\n\n\"These are shakedown schemes. It's a gross violation of what capitalism is supposed to stand for. I'd even call it extortion,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Privately, CEOs are horrified.\"\n\nBut Sonnenfeld said executives are not banding together to push back on Trump, as top business leaders did following Trump's election denialism in November 2020.\n\n\"CEOs need to speak up, like they did then, but they aren't doing it publicly,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Fear of retaliation is motivating the silence, but there has got to be a trigger line to stop this. We just don't know what that is yet.\"\n\nTalks with American investors for a potential acquisition of TikTok's U.S. enterprise have been moving in fits and starts for the past five years, starting back when the Trump administration declared the Chinese-owned hit video app to be a national security threat and sought to have it banned.\n\nSince Trump's about-face and embrace of TikTok, it has been clear that software and cloud-computing company Oracle would be a major player in the bid to take over the app's American presence.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a close confidante of Trump and the president has said both publicly and in private that he'd like to see TikTok controlled by Oracle.\n\nAccording to the source with direct knowledge of the talks, many of the deal's provisions have been under discussion for months, including that Oracle will host and oversee all of Americans' TikTok data. Beijing-based ByteDance will license its algorithm to the U.S. entity to be retrained based only on the 170 million U.S. users of the app and ByteDance will keep a minority stake in the company.\n\nThe one part of the agreement that caught investors by surprise? The multibillion-dollar fee request.\n\n\"They were taken aback when they were told they'd have to kick in,\" the source said. \"But I think they see it as just the price of doing business right now.\"",

      "headline": "Couples in Mumbai can now apply for fast-track amd weekend marriage registration services online",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nMumbai: BMC BMC has initiated an online application process for its newly launched fast-tracked and weekend marriage registration services.It has also expanded the marriage registration services to Christian, Jewish and Parsi couples from the same religion. For Sikhs, in addition to the current facility, registration of marriages under the Anand Marriage Act, 1909, has also been made available now.BMC has also removed the condition, wherein registration of marriage with civic offices was possible only if the wedding was held in Maharashtra. So now, couples who have tied the knot anywhere in the world can register their marriage in the BMC ward where either of the partners reside.Further, marriage registration certificates will now be issued with a QR Code, making it available for instant verification. The certificates could also be included in the DigiLocker facility in future, said officials.With BMC discontinuing the manual application process for regular marriage registrations, couples can seek appointments online on the civic website, said civic officials. Services like issuing certificates, photographs of married couples have also been made available online.Earlier, officials added, marriage registration of couples belonging to only Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh and Jain religions were done at civic offices. Now, the service has been extended to couples of other religions too.On Sunday, BMC introduced marriage registration services on weekends from 9am to 1pm and also reserved 20% of the daily slots on weekdays for same-day registration and certificate issuance as part of its fast-track marriage registration service. To access either service, couples will have to complete all documentation, pay the regular registration fee, along with an additional Rs 2,500, and appear in person with witnesses, said civic officials.Mumbaikars can avail the weekend marriage registration services on Saturdays at 13 BMC ward offices — A, C, E, F-South, G-South, H-East, K-East, P-South, P-North, R-Central, L, M-West, and S — and on Sundays at 12 BMC ward offices — B, D, F-North, G-North, H-West, K-West, P-East, R-South, R-North, N, M-East, and T, said civic officials.",

      "headline": "Heavy hand: Free-market US tested as Trump takes stakes in private companies",
      "content": "As a condition of allowing the sales of US Steel to Nippon, President Donald Trump demanded a government 'golden share' in the enteprise - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP/File Drew Angerer\n\nThe Trump administration is in talks to take an equity stake in Lithium Americas, which would insert the government into another private enterprise in the latest challenge to American free-market traditions.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of Trump announcements establishing government holdings in struggling semiconductor giant Intel and the rare earth company MP Materials. Trump also secured a “golden share” for Washington in United States Steel as a condition of its sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel.\n\nTalks are still ongoing on the Lithium Americas stake, part of a renegotiation of a US Department of Energy loan held by the Canadian mining company and General Motors, said a Trump administration official.\n\nThe White House has characterized the stock holding arrangements as a boon for taxpayers that points to Trump’s prowess as a dealmaker, while asserting that day-to-day management will be left to companies.\n\nBut free-market advocates have reacted with various degrees of alarm to a trend they see as undermining the strength of the US system and stoking crony capitalism. In the US system, the government sets up the rules governing the private sector but generally stays out of it thereafter as firms respond to market signals.\n\n“It undermines competition,” said Fred Ashton, director of competition policy at American Action Forum, who believes inserting the state into private enterprise leads to inefficiency and benefits politically favored firms over those less connected.\n\n“We know the president likes to win so there’s no way the government lets these firms fail,” Ashton said.\n\nTrump administration officials recently made use of the US Steel golden share. The company had planned to keep paying 800 workers while idling an Illinois factory, but decided to keep the plant running after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick invoked the golden share, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\n“You need to let an executive of the company conclude the best use of the capital,” said governance expert Charles Elson of the University of Delaware, who criticized the White House intervention.\n\n“The government is not in the business of picking winners and losers in the capital system,” he said. “That’s why we have a capital system.”\n\n– Bipartisan consensus –\n\nIt is not unprecedented for the US government to hold equity stakes. In response to the 2008 financial crisis, the US government amassed holdings in insurer AIG, General Motors and fellow automaker Chrysler as a condition of government support packages.\n\nBut the Treasury Department sold off the shares after the crisis ended, reflecting a bipartisan consensus, according to Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute think tank, who said presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama embraced the free market.\n\n“Obama would have laughed out of the room the suggestion that the government take an equity stake in a manufacturing company,” Strain said in a recent column that also criticized the White House’s tying of Nvidia and AMD export licenses to payments to the government.\n\nObama “understood that in America’s system of democratic capitalism, the government does not own or shake down private companies,” Strain said in the piece headlined “Is Trump a State Capitalist?”\n\nStrain, in an interview, predicted a “massive amount of crony capitalism” under Trump compared with the norm, but said the shifts will be too limited to significantly tilt the US macroeconomy given its size and tradition.\n\nAshton said he agrees that US status as a free market economy is not seriously in question. But he believes Trump’s conduct is distorting company behavior, noting reports that Apple may take a stake in Intel following Apple CEO Tim Cook’s August White House visit when he presented Trump with a 24-carat gold piece.\n\n“It’s become so murky,” Ashton said. “We don’t know whether it’s a business decision because it’s a business decision or whether it’s a business decision because they have to please the White House in some way.”",

      "headline": "EnergyBook Pro Ultra: New laptop promises up to 7 days standby time and 28 hours of intensive office use",
      "content": "4 Reviews ← exclude selected types\n\nEnergizer is no longer a stranger on the laptop market, having just officially announced a new notebook, the EnergyBook Pro Ultra. The main selling point of this model is its large 192 Wh battery, which reportedly provides up to 28 hours of office use. But there are other notebooks without gigantic batteries that also have similarly long battery life, as our review of the Asus Vivobook S16 proves. The large battery capacity of the EnergyBook Pro Ultra is, of course, a double burden: Firstly, it is likely to increase the weight. Secondly, devices with a battery capacity of 100 or 160 Wh are usually not permitted on passenger aircraft. The extent to which this rule is enforced and whether the EnergyBook Pro Ultra will attract the attention of airport staff is debatable. In the worst case, the notebook would have to be left behind when traveling.\n\nExact technical specifications in the form of a data sheet are not yet available, but concrete information about the features has been provided. An AMD Ryzen 5 processor and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM are expected. A 512 GB NVMe SSD is installed, and the 18-inch screen is said to have a resolution of 1,920 x 1,200, which isn't exactly sharp. USB Type-C, HDMI, USB, a memory card reader, and a headphone jack are available. A price of €449 ($525) has been announced, but availability is not yet known.",

      "headline": "Asus ROG Xbox Ally X – The Final Preview",
      "content": "The ROG Xbox Ally consoles launch on October 16th, marking the first time that Microsoft has released an official gaming handheld – albeit in heavy cooperation with Asus, makers of the original ROG Ally devices. The new ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X promise unique hardware and software improvements and could be priced aggressively, but can they compete against the Steam Deck, Switch 2 and a growing field of handheld gaming PCs?\n\nHere's what we know so far, based on our hands-on testing at Gamescom and a host of official announcements.\n\nThis is an Xbox – but not as you might expect. So what are they?\n\nTo be clear, these aren't proper handheld Xboxes that will play any Xbox game, despite the \"this is an Xbox\" branding. However, they're still capable handheld gaming machines that can play a huge number of PC games natively, or stream Xbox games, either from an Xbox console or Microsoft's cloud streaming service.\n\nROG Xbox Ally X – Images View 7 Images\n\nCompared to the old Ally devices, the new Xbox models have been spruced up with new AMD Z2 processors and a streamlined Windows operating system. That should translate into better performance and a step forward in usability, and could make these the best Steam Deck competitors so far.\n\nTwo models with significantly different levels of performance\n\nIt's worth knowing the difference between the two Xbox Ally models arriving in October: the Xbox Ally and the fancier Xbox Ally X.\n\nFirst up, the vanilla Xbox Ally offers Steam Deck level performance from its AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip, plus a higher-res screen, easier SSD upgradeability and wider game compatibility thanks to running Windows out of the box. However, the Steam Deck is available in an OLED model, is easier to drive given its lower 800p resolution, and runs the sleeker, often more performant Steam OS.\n\nThe more interesting Xbox Ally X uses AMD's brand new Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip, which promises the best performance we've seen in a PC gaming handheld, some exclusive Xbox features and more capable hardware. That could make it the device of choice for enthusiasts able to justify its high price – something we'll discuss later.\n\nROG Xbox Ally X – Product Specifications Chipset AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Memory 24GB LPDDR5X-8000 Storage 1TB M.2 2280 SSD Display 7\" 1080p 120Hz VRR IPS I/O 1x USB 4 Type-C, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 1x UHS-II MicroSD card reader, 1x 3.5mm Wireless WiFi 6E + Bluetooth 5.4 Battery 80Wh Dimensions 291x122x51mm Weight 715g\n\nHow fast will the new handhelds be?\n\nSo what will that performance difference look like? Looking at the hardware, the four Zen 2 cores and 8 RDNA 2 cores of the Xbox Ally ought to deliver roughly Steam Deck level performance at 15W, or a bit more at its maximum 20W TDP.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme's eight Zen 5 cores and 16 RDNA 3.5 graphics cores should be significantly faster than the Steam Deck. Some early Z2 Extreme test results show a ballpark 15% performance advantage over the Z1 Extreme ROG Ally at maximum power. Interestingly, these results also show higher performance differentials at lower wattages, as well as lower power draw at matched frame-rates, suggesting that overall efficiency has improved.\n\nHowever, both Asus and Microsoft have said there's plenty of optimisation work to be done, so we'll need to wait for final hardware, software and drivers – and a chance to perform our own testing – before we can say anything definitive about performance.\n\nROG Xbox Ally – Product Specifications Chipset AMD Ryzen Z2 A Memory 16GB LPDDR5X-6400 Storage 512GB M.2 2280 SSD Display 7\" 1080p 120Hz VRR IPS I/O 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 1x UHS-II MicroSD card reader, 1x 3.5mm Wireless WiFi 6E + Bluetooth 5.4 Battery 60Wh Dimensions 291x122x51mm Weight 670g\n\nAI features coming in 2026 – for the Xbox Ally X only\n\nThe Z2 Extreme also comes with dedicated AI hardware, with 50 TOPs of AI throughput, so what is it capable of? Out of the box, not much, but a few tantalising AI features are scheduled for 2026.\n\nThe most interesting is Auto SR, an FSR1-like post-process upscaling that has a fixed latency cost. This was an impressive option when it debuted on Snapdragon X Windows laptops, and this will be the first time it's more widely available.\n\nMicrosoft's marketing also notes a highlight reel feature, which promises to automatically generate clips of boss takedowns or multi-kills for social media.\n\nA thicker, comfier design with upgraded controls and impressive specs\n\nLet's talk about design. First, the vanilla Xbox Ally has a white shell, while the Xbox Ally X comes in black. Despite their varying capabilities, both Xbox Ally models are the same size, at 291 x 122 x 51mm, with a thicker design than the OG ROG Ally. That allows for proper Xbox-style controls and a comfier grip. Both models come with the same seven-inch 1080p 120Hz VRR LCD display as the original ROG Ally too.\n\nThe Xbox Ally X is 45g heavier than the standard Xbox Ally. A lot of that is due to a battery upgrade, from 60 watt hours to 80 watt hours, and the inclusion of dual-motor Impulse triggers. The X also upgrades one of the two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports on the vanilla model to USB 4, unlocking full speed access to DisplayPort 2.1 and Thunderbolt 4 devices – including external graphics cards.\n\nInside, the vanilla model gets 512GB of storage and 16GB of 6400MT/s RAM, while the X gets 1TB of storage and 24GB of 8000MT/s RAM. Both models use large M.2 2280 SSDs for easy upgradeability, rather than the smaller 2230 standard used on the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck. Finally, both devices come with a 65W charger and a stand in the box.\n\nWhat we said about the original Asus ROG Ally X The Asus ROG Ally X is simply the best handheld gaming PC on the market\n\nright now. With more and faster memory and double the battery as the\n\noriginal Ally, the Ally X will run any modern game without dying in an\n\nhour and a half. – Jacqueline Thomas, Jul 21, 2024 Score: 9 Read the full Asus ROG Ally X review.\n\nA redesigned interface, a wider launcher and more software updates\n\nAs well as some promising hardware, the Xbox Ally uses a new \"Xbox Full Screen Experience\" that promises a more gamepad-friendly interface and better performance than prior Windows gaming handhelds. For example, you can log in using the gamepad, rather than needing to enter your PIN via touch or use a fingerprint reader, which loads you into a full-screen Xbox app. Gamepad controls should work everywhere here, and you can hold down the dedicated Xbox button to quickly swap between games and apps or close them. There are also phone-style touch gestures to access the Game Bar or change apps.\n\nThe core Xbox app has seen some key improvements, including new library features that automatically bring in games from other launchers like Steam or GOG – though you'll need to actually install these games in the desktop Windows mode. However, once installed, you can see all of your games in the same place.\n\nXbox Ally X - Xbox App UI View 7 Images\n\nMicrosoft is also debuting an evolution on the Steam Deck Verified idea, with separate ratings for handheld optimisation and performance. The Handheld Optimised badge indicates a game that has a suitable interface and gamepad controls, while the Windows Performance Fit shows whether it'll run in excess of 30 or 60fps on your device.\n\nThere's even a Gaming Copilot that you should be able to ask for tips to progress in-game, or check your achievement progress, with the AI receiving a screenshot of your current game to help you. If you've used an ROG Ally handheld before, you'll be familiar with the Asus Armoury Crate app. This software will still be used for changing performance profiles, showing overlays and so on.\n\nAnd while Microsoft imagines that you'll spend most of your time in the new handheld-optimised mode, you can still access a full version of Windows 11, which spools up services like the desktop window manager that don't start in the default gaming mode. Afterwards, you can reboot to ensure you're getting full performance, or go straight back into the gaming UI if you're expecting to dip back and forth a few times.\n\nHands-on impressions from Gamescom\n\nSo how does the Xbox Ally actually play? Based on our hands-on time at Gamescom, both machines feel capable. They sport the same bright and responsive LCD display as the original Xbox Ally, but with improved ergonomics that are more in line with the Steam Deck than the Switch 2. The new user experience felt a little buggy, requiring a reboot on our first tester unit, but the improved launcher, touch gestures and fast game switching felt good and saved time.\n\nWith their Windows performance optimisations, plus extra power under the hood on Xbox Ally X, these could be some of the most capable gaming handhelds on the market… but we'll have to wait for final hardware and software before rendering a verdict.\n\nOfficial Xbox Ally pricing has finally been announced\n\nMicrosoft has confirmed that the lower-end Xbox Ally will retail for $599, while the full-fat Xbox Ally X will cost $999. In the UK, the Ally X will cost £799, while the Ally will cost £499. The EU reference prices are similar, at €899 and €599.\n\nThese prices suggest the Xbox Ally could be a shade cheaper than other Z2 Extreme-powered handhelds, like the MSI Claw A8 at £850 (about $1160) or the Lenovo Legion Go 2 at $1350, but still painful compared to, say, $650 for the most expensive Steam Deck.\n\nAs gaming gets even more expensive across the board, this handheld Xbox is a pricey privilege, no doubt. For its part, Microsoft is doubtlessly incentivized to keep prices as low as possible, in order to reap Game Pass subscriptions and game sales from a wider install base, but Asus is also looking to justify its long investment into PC handhelds – and create meaningful separation from its existing ROG Ally models. Ultimately, the value question comes down to the quality of the software and the strength of the silicon, both of which are still unknown quantities.\n\nAre you planning to get the Xbox Ally or another handheld gaming PC? Yes, I'm getting the ROG Xbox Ally X Yes, the ROG Xbox Ally Yes, the Lenovo Legion Go 2 or MSI Claw A8 No, I'm waiting for the next Steam Deck No, I'm not interested in handhelds Answer See Results\n\nCan Microsoft's secret sauce elevate the Xbox Ally consoles above other PC handhelds?\n\nIt feels like the Xbox Ally handhelds were originally pitched as offering both unique hardware and software, but consumers will be able to pick up other Z2 Extreme handhelds from MSI and Lenovo around the same time – though the Xbox-style controls remain unique. The unique software promise is time-limited too, as Microsoft has said that its handheld optimisations will arrive on other PC handhelds, and the revised launcher is already available on existing devices.\n\nRegardless, the Xbox Ally and Ally X could be the best value PC gaming handhelds at their respective price points, and it'll be fascinating to see whether Microsoft's console expertise pushes them to the top of what is an increasingly competitive field.",

      "headline": "Redisearch New Vector Quantization",
      "content": "We are excited to announce that Redis Query Engine now supports Quantization and Dimensionality Reduction for vector search. This is based on an Intel and Redis partnership leveraging Intel SVS-VAMANA with multiple compression strategies.\n\nRedis has always been the go-to choice for agents and applications demanding blazing-fast performance, and our community knows this comes with a direct relationship: memory usage equals operational cost. As vector search has become increasingly popular for powering AI applications, from recommendation engines to powering specialized agents, we've consistently heard from developers and operations teams about a common challenge: the memory footprint of high-dimensional embeddings can quickly become a budget concern.\n\nHere's the reality: when you're running vector search workloads on Redis, every vector stored in memory directly impacts your infrastructure costs. A typical deployment with millions of 768-dimensional vectors (common with modern embedding models) can consume hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. For organizations scaling their AI applications, this memory requirement often becomes the primary cost driver.\n\nBut what if you could dramatically reduce that memory footprint without sacrificing the search quality and performance that made you choose Redis in the first place? With a comprehensive compression strategy - Quantization and Dimensionality Reduction, we can reduce the total memory footprint by 26–37%, while preserving search quality and performance.\n\nDive into the compression technology\n\nModern vector similarity search faces a fundamental challenge: as datasets scale to billions of vectors with hundreds or thousands of dimensions, memory footprint becomes the dominant deployment constraint and memory bandwidth emerges as a primary performance bottleneck. Traditional approaches to million-scale similarity search have struggled with the dual pressure of maintaining search accuracy while managing memory footprint, particularly when dealing with the random memory access patterns inherent in graph-based algorithms.\n\nFor context, storing 100 million vectors with 1536 dimensions in single-precision floating-point format requires 572GB of memory. This scale makes traditional exact nearest vector search (like using FLAT index in Redis) impractical, necessitating approximate methods that can operate within reasonable memory constraints while maintaining acceptable accuracy levels.\n\nIntel SVS-VAMANA foundations\n\nSVS-VAMANA combines the Vamana graph-based search algorithm, introduced by Subramanya et al., with Intel’s compression technology: LVQ and LeanVec.\n\nVamana is similar to HNSW in its use of proximity graphs for efficient search. Unlike HNSW’s multi-layered structure, Vamana builds a single-layer graph and prunes edges during construction based on a tunable parameter. Both algorithms are capable of achieving very strong search performance but require substantial memory for both the graph structure and full-precision vectors, making compression essential for large-scale deployments.\n\nTraditional vector compression methods face critical limitations in the context of graph-based search:\n\nProduct Quantization (PQ) limitations: while popular for similarity search, it presents significant challenges for in-memory graph-based indices. When used for high-throughput graph search, PQ either requires keeping full-precision vectors in memory for re-ranking (defeating compression benefits) or accepts severely degraded accuracy.\n\nScalar Quantization (SQ) challenges: standard scalar quantization with global bounds for entire datasets or per-dimension bounds fails to efficiently utilize available quantization levels, resulting in suboptimal compression ratios.\n\nPrecision meets performance: The LVQ & LeanVec advantage\n\nThe key idea behind Locally-adaptive Vector Quantization (LVQ) is to apply per-vector normalization and scalar quantization, adapting the quantization bounds individually for each vector. This local adaptation ensures efficient use of the available bit range, resulting in high-quality compressed representations (see Figure 1). LVQ introduces minimal decompression overhead, enabling fast, on-the-fly distance computations. Its advantage lies in this balance: it significantly reduces memory bandwidth and storage requirements while maintaining high search accuracy and throughput, outperforming traditional methods.\n\nFigure 1: Empirical distributions of vector values in the deep-96-1M dataset\n\nFor 95% of the vectors, global and per-dimension normalization methods utilize only about 60% and 75% of the available value range, respectively. In contrast, LVQ normalization more closely approximates a uniform distribution, effectively using the full range and resulting in a more accurate and representative encoding. Figure from LVQ paper.\n\nLeanVec builds on top of LVQ by first applying linear dimensionality reduction, then compressing the reduced vectors with LVQ. This two-step approach significantly cuts memory and compute costs, enabling faster similarity search and index construction with minimal accuracy loss—especially for high-dimensional deep learning embeddings.\n\nThe compression gains are substantial. LVQ achieves a four-fold reduction of the vector size while maintaining search accuracy. A typical 768-dimensional float32 vector that normally requires 3072 bytes can be reduced to just a few hundred bytes through this quantization process— this is how we can achieve 51–74% reduction in the graph index and 26-37% overall memory footprint reduction.\n\nTwo-level vector compression\n\nFor high-dimensional vectors (like the 768-dimensional embeddings common in large language models) or when maximum accuracy is required, both techniques use a two-level approach (see Figure 2). .\n\nLVQ’s two-level compression works by first quantizing each vector individually to capture its main structure, then encoding the residual error—the difference between the original and quantized vector—using a second quantization step. This allows fast search using only the first level, with the second level used for re-ranking to boost accuracy when needed. In LVQ, LVQB₁xB₂ means the first level uses B₁ bits and the second level uses B₂ bits per vector dimension. For example, LVQ4x8 uses 4 bits for the main vector and 8 bits for the residual (i.e., a total of 12 bits per dimension).\n\nSimilarly, LeanVec uses a two-level approach: the first level reduces dimensionality and applies LVQ to speed up candidate retrieval, while the second level applies LVQ to the original high-dimensional vectors for accurate re-ranking. For example, LeanVec4x8 means the reduced-dimension vector is quantized with LVQ using 4 bits per dimension, while the original high-dimensional vector is quantized with 8 bits per dimension. Note that the original full-precision embeddings were never used by either LVQ or LeanVec, as both operate entirely on compressed representations.\n\nFigure 2. Two-level vector compression implementation with LVQ and LeanVec\n\nOptimized for performance\n\nIs this performant, since I’m doing all this computation? The engineering achievement is in the performance optimization. LeanVec improves search performance with a two-fold acceleration while operating on compressed vectors. The core performance optimization behind LVQ and LeanVec lies in their ability to maintain the sub-millisecond search times that Redis is known for while operating on a fraction of the original memory footprint. This is possible because graph-based similarity search is memory-bound—most of the time is spent fetching vectors from memory rather than computing distances. LVQ and LeanVec preserve enough accuracy that the slight increase in search effort doesn’t outweigh the gains from reduced memory bandwidth usage. As a result, the improved memory efficiency directly translates into faster search performance.\n\nA second key factor is LVQ’s extremely low decompression overhead. Techniques like Turbo LVQ optimize the memory layout of quantized vectors to align with SIMD-friendly access patterns. Instead of storing dimensions sequentially, Turbo LVQ permutes the layout to pack 128 dimensions into 64 bytes, allowing 16 dimensions to be unpacked with just two assembly instructions—compared to seven in traditional layouts. This enables highly efficient distance computations, effectively amortizing the cost of compression during search.\n\nTogether, these optimizations allow Redis powered by SVS-VAMANA with LVQ and LeanVec to deliver fast, accurate search with a much smaller memory footprint—without ever needing to access the original full-precision vectors. Check out the rule of thumbs and what compression option suits your use case.\n\nLeveraging Redis asynchronous vector indexing\n\nRedis vector indexes use a tiered index architecture designed to offload the heavy computational work required for inserting and deleting elements in graph-based vector indexes such as HNSW and the new SVS-VAMANA.\n\nIn this architecture, the Redis main thread, which is responsible for handling client requests, does not perform the full insertion directly. Instead, it temporarily stores new vectors in a bounded buffer. Background worker threads then asynchronously insert those vectors into the underlying graph structure (see Figure 3).\n\nThe same principle applies to deletions: the main thread only marks vectors as deleted, while background threads handle the expensive task of repairing graph links and reclaiming memory.\n\nA similar approach is applied when running queries, which is particularly beneficial for vector searches. By handling the heavy computation asynchronously, Redis ensures that the main thread remains responsive to other client requests. This design significantly increases both write and read throughput and enables efficient memory management, without compromising index quality or query accuracy.\n\nRedis Query Engine integrates SVS-VAMANA using this tiered index mechanism. As a result, users can sustain heavy vector write workloads while Redis continues to remain responsive, serving queries in parallel and consistently over dynamically evolving data.\n\nFigure 3. Redis Query Engine tiered index architecture\n\nBenchmark comparisons for memory, throughput, latency and ingestion time\n\nTo assess SVS-VAMANA performance we’ve used the vector-db-benchmark tool, focusing on high precision and high concurrency scenarios, across 3 different datasets, and 3 different CPU vendors (Intel, AMD, and ARM) using GCP, given SVS behaves differently, i.e. uses different algorithms, depending on the underlying hardware.\n\nOn Intel chips SVS-VAMANA can use LVQ and LeanVec, as described before. As a rule of thumb, you should use LVQ for vectors with dimensions lower than 768 and, use LeanVec for vectors with dimensions equal to or larger than 768. The benchmark methodology followed this recommendation.\n\nOn non Intel CPUs, i.e. AMD and ARM, and on Redis Open Source version, compression will fall back to SQ8. Developers can opt-in for install the SVS optimizations on Redis Open Source follow this guide.\n\nWe’ll deep dive into memory savings, throughput, latency improvements, and ingestion tradeoffs taking into account all 3 CPU types when the data is relevant for ARM/AMD, and always compare to the HNSW baseline. Ultimately, we want you to fully understand the benefits and tradeoffs of SVS-VAMANA after reading the following section.\n\nMemory gains\n\nOne of the most immediate benefits of the new Redis-Intel SVS compression is memory efficiency. Across all datasets we tested (detailed list on the appendix), SVS-VAMANA consistently delivered 26–37% total memory savings compared to HNSW, and when looking only at the vector index, the reductions were even more dramatic: 51–74% less memory used.\n\nChart 1. SVS-VAMANA memory efficiency vs. HNSW\n\nChart 1 highlights memory efficiency gains of SVS-VAMANA LVQ8 config per dataset compared to HNSW across multiple datasets and embedding sizes (Laion 512d, Cohere 768d, and DBpedia 1536d) for FP32 data. In every case, SVS-VAMANA significantly reduced total memory usage by up to 37%.\n\nIn practice, this means you can reduce your cloud footprint, or run larger workloads on the same hardware. SVS-VAMANA compression not only optimizes query performance, it also turns memory into a lever for cost efficiency, ensuring your vector search can scale sustainably.\n\nAccuracy trade-off, is there any?\n\nA natural concern with any new indexing method is whether accuracy suffers compared to HNSW. Our testing shows that it doesn’t: all SVS-VAMANA variants (LeanVec and LVQ) can match the high precision levels of HNSW, also confirming what Intel has documented in their Scalable Vector Search deep dive.\n\nChart 2. Precision vs. QPS for SVS-VAMANA and HNSW\n\nFrom Chart 2 we can see that at t every precision point—from ~0.92 up to 0.99—SVS-VAMANA tracks alongside HNSW in accuracy while consistently delivering higher queries per second (QPS). The advantage is visible both at lower precision targets, where SVS-VAMANA pulls ahead aggressively, and at higher precision levels, where it sustains up to 1.5× better throughput at the same precision.\n\nWith SVS-VAMANA you get HNSW-grade accuracy, plus the performance and efficiency benefits on top.\n\nUnlocking QPS and latency improvements with SVS-VAMANA\n\nBeyond memory savings while keeping accuracy, SVS-VAMANA unlocks meaningful performance improvements in real-world search workloads. Let’s start with throughput: which cases have benefits, and which ones not that much.\n\nChart 3. SVS-VAMANA vs. HNSW throughput per dataset\n\nOn FP32 datasets, throughput gains are substantial: up to 144% higher QPS on COHERE (768d, dot product) and up to 60% on DBpedia (1536d, cosine). These improvements are visible across the recommended SVS-VAMANA quantization method for vectors with dimensions equal to or higher than 768, LeanVec 4x8, and hold even at high precision thresholds (see Chart 3). You can check the COMPRESSION options and datasets details in the appendix.\n\nNot all datasets behave the same, however. On LAION (512d, cosine), SVS-VAMANA yields only marginal improvements—0–15% in most cases, with some degradation. It’s worth noting that these results still come with a reduction in memory footprint, which can be attractive to customers even in cases without significant performance gains. This makes SVS-VAMANA most appealing for medium-to-large embedding workloads (768–3,072 dimensions), where both memory and compute savings amplify its advantages.\n\nThroughput is only half the story. For many production workloads, what really matters is latency—how fast results come back when systems are under load. Looking at p50 and p95 latencies, SVS-VAMANA consistently outperforms HNSW, cutting response times even as query concurrency scales.\n\nOn FP32, the gains are striking: on Cohere (768d, dot product), SVS-VAMANA reduced latency by 60% at p50 and 57% at p95 compared to HNSW. DBpedia (1536d, cosine) also showed strong improvements, with 46% lower p50 and 36% lower p95, for high concurrency benchmarks (see Chart 4).\n\nChart 4. SVS-VAMANA vs. HNSW search latency per dataset for FP32 datatype\n\nWith FP16 (Chart 5), the picture is consistent but the drops are smaller, with the largest advantage being on Cohere dataset dropping latencies up to 43%. 43%/40% on Cohere, and 11% on DBpedia. This is expected: SVS-VAMANA accelerates search primarily by reducing memory accesses, so when each vector already consumes less memory (as with FP16) the relative advantage naturally shrinks. Even then, SVS-VAMANA still delivers meaningful latency improvements where workloads are memory-bound.\n\nChart 5. SVS-VAMANA vs HNSW search latency per dataset for FP16 datatype\n\nAcross datasets, these reductions translate into faster responses for end users under heavy traffic. While LAION (512d) shows little to no change on latency while still reducing memory, the medium- and high-dimensional workloads—Cohere and DBpedia—demonstrate that SVS-VAMANA not only improves throughput but also keeps response times reliably low at scale while saving memory at the same time.\n\nFor all data-dependent compression methods, the benefits naturally vary across datasets, as they are influenced by factors such as dimensionality, the structure of the embedding manifold, and overall compressibility. Cohere and DBpedia, being higher-dimensional, show greater benefits than LAION. Differences between Cohere and DBpedia likely stem from variations in their embedding manifolds. Even though LAION shows smaller gains, it still maintains performance while using significantly fewer bits—half compared to float16 and a quarter compared to float32—demonstrating the strength of LVQ compression.\n\nIngestion trade-offs – computing compression\n\nThe main cost of SVS-VAMANA lies in ingestion. To illustrate it, we’ve selected 2 datasets, one for each SVS-VAMANA variant (LAION for SVS LVQ8 and DBPEDIA for LeanVec 4x8), see Chart 6 and Chart 7.\n\nChart 6. SVS-VAMANA LVQ upload time overhead vs. HNSW\n\nChart 7. SVS-VAMANA LeanVec upload time overhead vs. HNSW\n\nAs shown in Chart 7, index construction times are higher than HNSW. On x86 platforms (Intel and AMD) the overhead is manageable.\n\nSVS-VAMANA is currently not optimized for ingestion performance, so slowdowns compared to HNSW are expected. These differences stem from several factors, including the additional overhead introduced by vector compression, differences in the graph edge pruning strategies used in each algorithm, and the concurrency control approach used in SVS-VAMANA, which relies on a global lock during ingestion.\n\nIngestion with LeanVec is generally faster than with LVQ, primarily because search is significantly faster with LeanVec, which typically operates on dimensionally reduced vectors quantized with 4 bits per dimension—resulting in highly compressed representations. We plan to investigate these aspects further and work on targeted optimizations for future releases.\n\nFor Intel:\n\nLeanVec can accelerate upload times in some cases (e.g., up to 25% faster on Intel FP32), but it may also be up to 33% slower depending on the dataset. These differences stem mostly from how dataset characteristics like dimensionality, embedding structure, and compressibility influence the effectiveness of data-dependent compression methods.\n\ncan accelerate upload times in some cases (e.g., up to on Intel FP32), but it may also be up to depending on the dataset. These differences stem mostly from how dataset characteristics like dimensionality, embedding structure, and compressibility influence the effectiveness of data-dependent compression methods. LVQ is generally slower, with ingestion times reaching up to 2.6× longer than HNSW.\n\nFor AMD, the fallback algorithm (SQ8) showcased either improvements on the upload time for FP32 or small regressions depending on the configuration. Nonetheless, and as mentioned above, the overhead is smaller.\n\nChart 8. ARM SVS-VAMANA SQ8 fallback upload time overhead vs. HNSW\n\nOn ARM, the story is different. Ingestion times can be 9× slower (see Chart 8) than HNSW, making SVS-VAMANA impractical on ARM platforms today. This gap is less about ARM hardware capabilities and more about the fact that SVS-VAMANA optimizations are primarily tuned for x86, and the fallback algorithm (SQ8) is not optimized for ARM. In other words, SVS-VAMANA and its fallback, isn’t yet optimized for ARM ingestion workloads.\n\nComparison with other CPUs. Choosing the right fit\n\nOur benchmarks show that the best algorithm depends on the underlying hardware, considering the regular quantization (SQ8 fallback) versus Intel optimizations. Both x86 (Intel and AMD) and ARM have strengths — but they shine in different ways.\n\nTo prove it, we’ve charted below (Charts 9 and 10) the achievable QPS at a 0.95 precision for the DBPEDIA dataset across Intel (c4), AMD (c4d), and ARM (c4a) instances on GCP. We also included an additional SVS-VAMANA configuration tuned for performance, LeanVec Dimensions/4, obtained by setting REDUCE, the target dimension used in the dimensionality reduction step, to 384 (i.e., dim/4 = 1536/4 = 384).\n\nChart 9. CPU RPS comparison for FP32 for SVS-VAMANA and HNSW\n\nChart 10. CPU RPS comparison for FP16 for SVS-VAMANA and HNSW\n\nThe results confirm a clear theme: the best algorithm depends heavily on the underlying hardware.\n\nOn x86 platforms, SVS-VAMANA really comes into its own. On Intel platforms, large performance gains are achieved by leveraging Intel's compression technologies, while on AMD, strong performance is enabled through the SQ8 fallback, delivering:\n\nHigher query throughput — up to 144% improvement over HNSW in some datasets.\n\n— up to 144% improvement over HNSW in some datasets. Lower latency — p50 and p95 reduced by up to 60%.\n\n— p50 and p95 reduced by up to 60%. Smaller memory footprint — 26–37% less overall memory, 51–74% less index memory.\n\nFor high-throughput, FP32 workloads where performance and memory efficiency matter most, x86 + SVS-VAMANA is the recommended configuration.\n\nFurthermore, the performance-tuned LeanVec dim/4 configuration improves ingestion time, always outperforming HNSW.\n\nOn ARM platforms, the story is different. ARM already runs HNSW exceptionally well — in fact, our benchmarks show ARM HNSW can even edge ahead of x86 HNSW by ~10% in search throughput depending on the use-case. For teams standardizing on ARM infrastructure, this means you can achieve competitive performance with HNSW at lower cost and power efficiency, and that the fallback algorithm on ARM, which is Scalar Quantization 8, is not yielding better results than HNSW.\n\nToday, SVS-VAMANA on ARM does not yet match its x86 performance. Upload times are longer, and query throughput lags behind Intel and AMD. This is primarily due to the lack of ARM-native vector acceleration for SVS-VAMANA and an optimized implementation of the fallback algorithm used (SQ8 like mentioned previously). However, ARM’s excellent HNSW results make it a strong choice for production workloads until further optimizations arrive.\n\nTakeaway:\n\nIf you are on x86, SVS-VAMANA offers top-tier speed, latency, and memory savings—delivering major gains on Intel and strong results on AMD even without the optimized version.\n\nIf you’re on ARM, HNSW continues to be the go-to option — delivering competitive search performance and excellent efficiency.\n\nDifferences in configurations and comparison of benefits for LVQ & LeanVec\n\nFrom a developer perspective, new Redis SVS-VAMANA integrates seamlessly into your existing Redis workflows. When creating vector indices with FT.CREATE, you can now specify the new SVS-VAMANA algorithm along with compression options directly in your VECTOR field definitions.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous sessions, the ultimate gains came from Intel hardware optimizations (LVQ and LeanVec), while in others platforms the option always falls in a regular quantization method using 8-bit (SQ8). For developers, it’s transparent, since the optimization is triggered in Redis Enterprise as soon as the Intel hardware is detected.\n\nCode on Redis Open Source, using regular SQ8 and leverage the optimizations for Intel on Enterprise. Please check the documentation instructions on how to trigger the optimizations also on Redis Open Source.\n\nNote:\n\nHere's how simple it is to enable COMPRESSION using SVS-VAMANA:\n\n```\n\nFT.CREATE myindex SCHEMA\n\nembedding VECTOR SVS-VAMANA 6\n\nCOMPRESSION LVQ8\n\nTYPE FLOAT32\n\nDIM 768\n\nDISTANCE_METRIC COSINE\n\n```\n\nOn the query side, your application code remains unchanged—the same search commands return the same high-quality results, just with improved memory efficiency. The quantization happens transparently during indexing, and Redis Query Engine handles all the complexity of encoding, storage, and fast similarity computation.\n\nWhether you're working with FLOAT16 or FLOAT32 vectors, compression is supported across both data types, giving you the flexibility to choose the precision that best fits your application requirements while still benefiting from the memory savings.\n\nIn order to understand better what compression to use, it’s important to understand the different embedding options and applications for a given use case see Figure 4.\n\nCommon embedding types & their characteristics\n\nFigure 4. Decision tree for selecting the right quantization\n\nDifferent embedding models create vectors with distinct properties that affect quantization and compression performance:\n\nText Embeddings (OpenAI, BERT, Cohere, SentenceTransformers): These models typically produce 384 to 1536-dimensional vectors that are dense and semantically rich.\n\nImage Embeddings (CLIP, ResNet, ViT): Usually exceeding 1024 dimensions, these vectors exhibit higher variability and noise due to the complexity of visual data.\n\nMultimodal Embeddings (CLIP, unified models): These vectors combine text and image characteristics, creating mixed data patterns that often require more sophisticated quantization strategies to preserve recall across different modalities.\n\nCustom Embeddings (anomaly detection, feature engineering): Domain-specific vectors may need calibration or profiling to determine optimal quantization settings, but SVS-VAMANA adaptive approach typically handles these variations effectively.\n\nThe SVS-VAMANA with LVQ and LeanVec configurations reflects the number of bits allocated per dimension at each level of compression.\n\nNaming convention: LVQ<B₁>x<B₂>\n\nB₁: Number of bits per dimension used in the first-level quantization.\n\nB₂: Number of bits per dimension used in the second-level quantization (residual encoding).\n\nLVQ Applies per-vector normalization and scalar quantization LVQ8, LVQ4x4, LVQ4x8 LeanVec Combines dimensionality reduction with LVQ, applying quantization after reducing vector dimensions. LeanVec4x8, LeanVec8x8\n\nAs an example, we elaborate in Table 1 with different embedding types and use cases, and the suggested Compression to use. Depending on the type and dimensionality chosen, these numbers may vary considerably.\n\nEmbedding Category Optimal Use Cases Example Embeddings (Dimension) Compression Strategy Index Reduction Text Embeddings Document search, semantic similarity, Q&A systems Cohere embed-multilingual-v3 (1024) OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (1536) LeanVec 4x8 (following REDUCE adjustments if required) ~3x compression Image Embeddings Visual similarity search, content-based retrieval ResNet-152 (2048) LeanVec 4x8 ~3x compression Multimodal Cross-modal search, unified content systems CLIP ViT-B/32 (512) LVQ8 ~3.5x compression Custom/Domain Anomaly detection, specialized feature matching Cohere embed-v3 (1024) LeanVec 4x8 ~3x\n\nTable 1. Compression strategy per use-case.\n\nWhile optimizing the memory footprint using vector compression, it may require slightly changing the `SEARCH_WINDOW_SIZE` (equivalent to HNSW’s `EF_RUNTIME`) to match search accuracy. See the entire list of advanced parameters for tuning the Index and Query in our documentation.\n\nBuilding the future\n\nOn our road to sustain our tripod of speed, accuracy and cost, we will keep extending the coverage of a comprehensive compression, leveraging multiple techniques for other indexes, such as HNSW, and index types. As part of our partnership with Intel, we plan to incorporate other SVS library optimizations into the Redis Query Engine. One key enhancement is the use of LeanVec for handling out-of-distribution (OOD) queries—a major challenge in cross-modal retrieval—through a query-aware dimensionality reduction approach.\n\nMulti-vectors support is also part of the roadmap, which brings different challenges in keeping memory footprint and computing efficiency.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nProduct quantization and scalar quantisation with global constants alone don't do the magic If you’re on x86, SVS-VAMANA unlocks the best combination of speed, latency, and memory savings. If you’re on ARM, HNSW continues to be the go-to option — delivering competitive search performance and excellent efficiency. Rule of Thumb: Leverage LeanVec for high-dimensional vectors (>=768) while LVQ will be better suitable for smaller dimensionality vectors (<768)\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the outstanding collaboration between Intel and Redis in bringing the Intel SVS library into the Redis Query Engine. From Intel, Aaron Lin, Ishwar Bhati, Mihai Capotă, Cecilia Aguerrebere, Ethan Glaser, Andreas Huber, Yue Jiao, Nikolay Petrov, Alexander Andreev, Maria Petrova, Sergey Yakovlev, Martin Dimitrov, Marcin Pozniak, Rafik Saliev, and Maria Markova contributed their deep expertise in optimization, quantization, and systems engineering. From Redis, Alon Reshef, Meirav Grimberg, Dor Forer, Omer Lerman, Adriano Amaral, Manvinder Singh, Pieter Caillaiu, Filipe Oliveira, Paulo Souza, Nathan Dunford, and Patrick Campbell worked closely to integrate and validate these capabilities. This joint effort has resulted in significant memory savings and performance improvements, advancing the state of vector search within Redis.\n\nAppendix: Datasets and compression used\n\nWe used datasets representing various use cases.\n\nWe selected the following datasets to cover a wide range of dimensionalities and distance functions. This approach ensures that we can deliver valuable insights for various use cases, from simple image retrieval to sophisticated text embeddings in large-scale AI applications.\n\nDatasets Number of vectors Vector dimensionality Distance function Description laion-img-emb-512-1M-cosine 1,000,000 512 Cosine Image embeddings derived from the LAION-5B dataset. cohere-768-1M 1,000,000 768 Dot Product English Wikipedia embeddings generated with Cohere’s multilingual encoder. dbpedia-openai-1M-angular 1,000,000 1536 Cosine OpenAI’s text embeddings dataset of DBpedia entities, using the text-embedding-ada-002 model.\n\nTable 2. Datasets\n\nCompression configurations\n\nBelow you can find the index build and runtime configuration parameters used in our benchmarks, covering the different compression strategies evaluated.\n\nDuring the query stage of the benchmarks , EF_RUNTIME (for HNSW) and SEARCH_WINDOW_SIZE (for SVS-VAMANA) are automatically tuned during calibration until the search reaches 0.95 precision.\n\nVariation Compression Index Build Params Runtime Params HNSW None M = varied from 16 to 32; EF_CONSTRUCTION = 200 EF_RUNTIME varied to reach @0.95 precision in the benchmark tool.

      "headline": "Tired of shader compilation screens? Microsoft is rolling out its own solution, but we won't feel the benefits immediately",
      "content": "Last month, Microsoft introduced Advanced Shader Delivery, a mechanism that claims to solve one of the biggest annoyances PC gamers face these days: shader compilation. Although the technology will initially be limited to the Asus ROG Xbox Ally handhelds and games purchased through the Xbox app, an update to Agility SDK means that other vendors and merchants can now get started on supporting it too.\n\nMicrosoft's Agility software development kit (SDK) is a collection of tools that game developers can use to implement the latest DirectX features, without having to wait for them to be integrated into Windows itself. In the latest 1.618 version, Agility now supports Advanced Shader Delivery, which was announced last month.\n\nThe rather unassuming name is for a complex database system that will hopefully be the ultimate solution to all problems relating to shader compilation. Modern 3D graphics involve tens of thousands of different shaders, and APIs such as DirectX, Vulkan, or Metal generate them in a common format. For your graphics card to be able to process them, they need to be compiled specifically for that hardware.\n\nFor gaming PCs, that process is carried out by the GPU drivers, and it's why your CPU's fan suddenly goes wild when you load up certain games. Depending on when and how the compilation stage has been implemented by a game's developer, you can either get a long, grinding stage before you even get to the main menu or problems during gameplay as the drivers struggle to compile shaders that have been missed.\n\nAdvanced Shader Delivery solves all of this by removing the whole compilation process from your PC's hands (well, processors) and doing it 'offline', i.e. by the game developers themselves. The idea is to have a database that stores the compiled shaders for any given game, for every hardware configuration that's able to run it.\n\nYou really don't want to skip the shader compilation.... (Image credit: GSC Game World)\n\nThen, when you download a game from the likes of Steam, the pre-compiled shaders are bundled with it. And hey presto! No lengthy compilation screens, no screaming CPU fans, no shader stutters mid-battle.\n\nConsole gamers already enjoy this because that's how it's done for PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox games. However, the database only needs to deal with one or two hardware setups, so it's a much easier affair to manage. With gaming PCs, the sheer number of different GPUs that can run any given game makes it a much larger challenge.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nTo simplify the process as much as possible, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia are providing the offline compilers for developers to use, and Microsoft has developed a set of APIs for digital storefronts to integrate into their installers. So when you fire up your newly downloaded game for the first time, it checks the database for the correct pre-compiled shaders to use.\n\nGames that handle shader compilation in the background might not benefit from Advanced Shader Delivery (Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment)\n\nWhether the entire PSDB (pre-compiled shader database) is part of the game's download or just a relevant subset isn't clear, but I suspect that the first stores and games to support Advanced Shader Delivery will probably go with the former. That means the size of the download will be larger, but for many PC gamers, that will be an acceptable trade-off for long loading times and stutters.\n\nAs things currently stand, the first store to host PSDBs for its games will be Microsoft's Xbox app, and even, only for the Asus ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handhelds. That's just two hardware configurations, so it's not hard to see why the first iteration of the system is so limited.\n\nFor every other game store, we've got a long wait on our hands. Firstly, we need game developers to integrate the Advanced Shader Delivery system (which will be simple in some cases and a major hassle in others), then we need Valve, GOG, Epic, Ubisoft, et al to do the same.\n\nI suspect that we won't see it making an appearance until we're well into 2026, at the earliest, and even then, it will probably just be added to new releases or older ones that are still very popular (and would significantly benefit). Super-fast load times and a dearth of shader stutter are two advantages that consoles have over gaming PCs, so anything that can be done to even the playing field is a must-have, even if it takes a while to get here.",

      "content": "Description: ParkControl is Pro Windows app to adjust CPU core parking and heterogenous processor scheduling settings.\n\nPro Benefits\n\nBitsum Dynamic Boost\n\nAutomatically switch power plans when your PC enters and leaves the idle state\n\nPower Plan change Notifications\n\nNotifications of when and what process changed your active power plan (image)\n\nSupport Bitsum’s Independent Innovation\n\nYour support enables us to create new tools, and maintain our existing ones!\n\nIntroduction to CPU Core Parking\n\nCPU Parking is a low-power sleep state (C6) supported by most modern processors and operating systems. It dynamically disables CPU cores in an effort to conserve power when idle. Unfortunately, this power saving comes at a price: Latency when CPUs need unparked to execute code.\n\nInitially, core parking was controlled entirely by the operating system. The aggressive core parking of Windows led to a great deal of inefficiency during bursting CPU loads. Intel moved core parking control onto the chip in the Skylake generation, and AMD followed, but still the parameters of the Windows power plans are set to aggressively park CPU cores. Even the default ‘High Performance’ power plan is not immune. The new ‘Ultra Performance’ power plan copies what Bitsum did with our own ‘Bitsum Highest Performance’ power plan and finally disables core parking entirely.\n\nParkControl (and Process Lasso) not only let one more easily configure CPU core parking and frequency scaling, but also allow for dynamic entrance into a higher performance power plan. For instance, with Process Lasso, you can automatically enter ‘Bitsum Highest Performance’ will you start a game, then go back to ‘Balanced’ when you exit.\n\nParkControl has Dynamic Boost to allow you to set active and idle power plans. Process Lasso has a similar feature with its IdleSaver.\n\nEfficacy of Disabling Core Parking\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that disabling CPU core parking can make a tangible improvement in system performance. There are many factors that will determine precisely how effective it will be for a given situation. However, generally, Windows is too aggressive in its core parking, resulting in high latency during bursting CPU loads, stemming from the overhead of having to unpark CPU cores. Since bursting CPU loads are the most common type for many workloads, core parking can be a substantial drag on system performance and responsiveness.\n\nUsing ParkControl\n\nParkControl lets you easily set CPU core parking and frequency scaling parameters for both AC (plugged-in) and DC (battery) power states of your device.\n\nBoth CPU core parking and frequency scaling are power saving features of modern CPUs. CPU core parking is when cores are put into a sleep-like state when demand is low. Similarly, CPU frequency scaling allows the CPU base frequency to be lowered, again to conserve energy.\n\nEach power plan has its own settings, and can be selected via the power plan drop-down. When you select a power plan, the user interface will populate with that power plan’s settings. After making changes, click the ‘Apply’ button to save them. Use the ‘Make active’ button to switch the PC to that power plan.\n\nRelease Name: Bitsum ParkControl Pro 5.5.0.8\n\nSize: 3.6 MB\n\nLinks: HOMEPAGE – NFO – Torrent Search\n\nDownload: RAPiDGATOR",

After spending some time with a few of these systems, however, buyers may want to consider older and oftentimes cheaper Ryzen 7 7840HS, Ryzen 9 7940HS, or Ryzen 9 7940HS options instead. Performance is also similar to the Ryzen 9 8845HS as previously reported which is arguably far too many processor SKUs with few differentiating factors between them.\n\nOur benchmarks below show that the Ryzen 7 H 255 performs almost exactly the same as the aforementioned alternatives. All four processors share the same number of cores, threads, cache sizes, integrated Radeon 780M graphics, and even lack of an NPU. Indeed, the Ryzen 7 H 255 is really just a rebadged last generation Zen 4 processor despite it launching amongst a sea of faster and more efficient Zen 5 options.\n\nOverall performance is still very good for most HTPC or 4K streaming purposes especially when compared to outdated Iris Xe or Radeon RX Vega mini PCs. Users looking to save a bit of money will nonetheless find that the nearly 3-year old Ryzen 7 7840HS can offer better performance-per-dollar. The AMD CPU naming convention has changed since the days of the Ryzen 7 7840HS and so the Ryzen 7 H 255 isn't making it any easier for buyers who may be unaware of the recent changes.\n\nMore benchmarks and comparisons on the Ryzen 7 H 255 can be found on our review of the NucBox K12.",

Snapdragon X, Looking to 2029...\n\nDon't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google.\n\nLAHAINA, MAUI—The highlight of this year's Snapdragon Summit is the unveiling of Qualcomm's second-generation Snapdragon X2 Arm laptop processors, including a new \"Extreme\" tier of chips that looks poised to take on AMD's, Intel's, and Apple's best. PCs with the new X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme processors won't appear until the first half of 2026, but Qualcomm is setting some great expectations: 18-core and 12-core processors with serious multicore CPU muscle, a field-leading TOPS count on its neural processor (an 80 TOPS NPU), and a redesigned graphics core.\n\nWith Intel on the ropes but now poised to work more closely than ever with Nvidia on co-designed \"RTX\" SoCs, with AMD benefitting from the power vacuum left by Intel, and with Apple Silicon going strong, it's the wildest time ever to cover laptop processors. PCMag's John Burek and Wired's Luke Larsen were given the opportunity to sit down with one of the company’s senior executives to chat about the new Snapdragon X2 Elite family. We quizzed Kedar Kondap, SVP and GM of Qualcomm's Compute division, on various aspects of the new X2 chips: their makeup, the new Snapdragon Guardian tech designed to appeal to enterprise, and how to cool these fierce-looking chips. The interview has been slightly edited and shortened for clarity.\n\nMarket Successes for Snapdragon X So Far\n\nPCMAG: We've seen various numbers from different sources—adoption numbers relative to the rest of the market—for the initial Snapdragon X Elite. Do you have anything that you can, want, or are able to share in terms of market percentages, numbers in terms of units sold, things of that sort?\n\nKONDAP: I can get you the right numbers that we've shared publicly, but we announced that at earnings. When you look at categories where we were focused—which is devices that are thin-and-light, $600 and above, with integrated GPU—in certain markets I think we've done really well...\n\nSo, approximately 9% of Windows laptops above $600 in the US and the top five European countries. These are the regions we focused on primarily in the first launch. We wanted to make sure that we were focused in how we delivered X Elite into the market. And it was staggered, right? We launched X Elite in June 2024; we launched X Plus devices in September at IFA last year; and then the X came in January. We announced in January, and devices came a little bit after that.\n\nWIRED: I'm curious—you probably don't have the numbers for this—about consumer purchases. Obviously, with some of the stuff announced, you are trying to push into enterprise more, which is where the big numbers are. Can you talk about how you are doing for consumers, people buying directly from stores and online?\n\nKONDAP: Yeah. The market, as you put it, is segmented between consumer and commercial. We focused the first launches on consumer. We've done a lot of pilots and enterprise trials. Those are in progress. We're a lead partner, in IT, ourselves. We've deployed more than 16,000 laptops at Qualcomm, so we're obviously leading the wave here. From a consumer standpoint, your question was more around, how did we approach the consumer segment?\n\nWIRED: I'm just wondering if you guys are doing better in that specific target [market] than enterprise?\n\nKONDAP: So our first focus was that we targeted consumer. Look at the investments and the strategy that we had. Products were very consumer-focused. We partnered with retailers, consumer retailers, globally. We had 50-plus retailers that we partnered with to have devices available. We focused on OEM dotcom channels. So, like, all of the OEM channels had devices. We announced more than 9,300 stores, and some of them even had a Snapdragon-branded kiosk. And the reason for us to do that is to build a relationship with the consumer. We wanted the consumer to understand: One, to understand the brand, but second, also to understand these experiences. The AI stuff is new, and there's not one specific app, or one use case, that's going to fit everybody....\n\nBut in parallel, we have started enterprise trials. Like I said, Qualcomm has led the way, but we have other partners like SAP and many others that have already deployed or are testing actively. We know that takes a little bit longer. Part of why we introduced Snapdragon Guardian today is to showcase more benefits to enterprises and what we can offer.\n\nAbout Snapdragon Guardian\n\nWIRED: I assume Guardian will be offered in all laptops, not just those sold directly into commercial?\n\nKONDAP: The use cases—obviously, it depends. For example, an OEM wants to sell it into the consumer space and add a capability with Guardian. You have the ability to track a PC, manage a PC. I'll give you a good use case.\n\nKids, for example, right? Many schools allow for kids to carry laptops, but they don't allow them to carry phones. So great use case: You know, today, on phones, people have Life360, or one of these apps that you can track where your kids are. You can geofence stuff. Think of it as something very similar. You have the ability to geofence where your kids are, have it on a laptop, and be able to manage it remotely. You can access what they're doing. So we want to give that control to consumers. So it's both a consumer and a commercial thing—but obviously it benefits largely commercial enterprises.\n\nWIRED: Will it be that when people buy those laptops, will they experience that? As in, are OEMs going to use that technology, then rebrand it? Or are we going to see it directly, like a feature in every laptop?\n\nKONDAP: I don't think we're ready to talk about that yet. But we wanted to showcase the technology and what we built because we have added the Guardian technology as a separate subsystem in our platform. So we've taken the steps to make sure that it is a secure subsystem within our SoC, and it provides the ability for our OEM partners to build on top of that. They can choose to offer it either in consumer or commercial. We're providing the foundation, if you will.\n\nPCMAG: About the Guardian stuff, I heard a mention in the presentation that it would be available even if the system was powered off. I was trying to figure out how that works. Are you able to talk on that?\n\nKONDAP: It is a separate subsystem within the SoC, and it connects to a cellular modem. The whole system stays in a low-power island. You can wake the modem up, which will wake up the subsystem. Now, as you know, that can go through multiple scenarios—like, for example, if it's a dead-battery situation, then obviously you can't do anything about it. But then, at the same time, our intent is offering this to enterprise or IT administrators. We want to give them the control to manage devices better, and the risk of a malicious attack is low if you're in a dead-battery situation. So as long as the user plugs in the laptop and brings it up to a certain threshold of battery, you have the ability to wake it up and just push a patch, or be able to do any activities...\n\nPCMAG: Disable it, or whatever the case.\n\nKONDAP: It's totally up to the IT administrators.\n\nSome SoC Particulars\n\nPCMAG: Question on the SoC. I was looking at the specs we were given and noticed that there were different memory allocations for the three different X2 SKUs announced so far. The first, the Elite Extreme, is at 48GB. The others were listed as \"device-dependent.\" And I was just wondering why the 48GB ceiling was landed upon. Any particular reason?\n\nKONDAP: I think the X2 Elite Extreme devices you saw, that we were running, had 48GB of memory. Honestly, we just picked the 48GB because that is still a pretty sweet spot. There's no science behind it. The X2 Elite can address up to 128GB. 48GB is already big for most users. So there's no science behind why we picked that.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nPCMAG: Is there anything you can speak to in terms of the Adreno GPU? The efficiency gains that were claimed on stage today are pretty impressive. And any insight into how you got to that point versus the first gen?\n\nKONDAP: It's a completely new Adreno GPU, designed ground up for this stuff. It has a new architecture, better shader pipelines. The entire GPU is new. It's not iterative. It is a new generation. And of course, if you're able to attend the sessions after this, we will go into a lot more technical details on exactly how it is done. But yes, it's a completely new architecture, and that's how we're able to get the performance gains as well as the power efficiency.\n\nPCMAG: One other thing that came up when I was talking with some of the folks in the benchmarking session that we had yesterday. The two reference desktops shown—I understand that they're being cooled with AirJet—Frore Systems' AirJet cooling—one of the reps told me?\n\nKONDAP: We have the option to do both. I should say, technically, you have the option to do three things. One, you can have the option to enable this with a fanless design. You can get close to at least 12 watts TDP, if not a little bit more. Or, you can use a regular fan. Or, you can use AirJet. And so, right now, we have two of the SKUs, I believe, that we're showing here. One of the designs is fanless, and the other one has AirJet, which gives you close to 25 watts TDP.\n\nIt's just an option that we want to showcase—that in the same X2 Elite or the X2 Elite Extreme, you can utilize the entire benefit and choose your design points, no different than laptops. And you can tell when you look at the form factors, the difference is insignificant in terms of what you can do, but you can still get 25 watts of performance at very low power.\n\nPCMAG: Thoughts on using AirJet outside of these desktops, in things like laptops? There's no reason you couldn't do that?\n\nKONDAP: No restriction. We just showcased this technology in the small form factors.\n\nMarket Positioning for the New X2 Chips\n\nWIRED: Can you talk about who the X2 Elite Extreme is for, and the thought behind offering that as a separate configuration?\n\nKONDAP: There's swim lanes, right? You have certain price points in certain swim lanes. The X1 Elite was in the price band, or I'll say the sweet spot, of $1,000 device SPs. Think of the X2 Elite as something very similar to that. The Extreme version with the 18-core CPU, with the much higher graphics core, will address a higher tier of experiences. That's part of why we focus so much on talking about gaming and creator use cases. We want to start showcasing the performance, and that's where you get the true benefit of running stuff.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nEverybody's in search of this one AI app that is going to transform. But we believe the workloads are going to get to agentic. And as you start looking at the whole scenario, all these different agents running on the device, we believe that it's going to run across all the different cores (obviously, on the NPU for low power), and it's going to run hybrid as necessary....Same reason why, for example, we added an 80 TOPS NPU. We believe that we're capping out in terms of many of the use cases that we're running, even at 45 TOPS. So we're enhancing leadership in each of those areas.\n\nWIRED: The 80 TOPS will be across the lineup, right? In the same way that 50 TOPS is across the [current Snapdragon X] lineup?\n\nKONDAP: We're keeping it constant. But the memory is different. In the X2 Elite and the X2 Elite Extreme, the memory configurations are different. DDR—the available bandwidth is different.\n\nFor example, you can address close to about 150, 152, gigabits per second in the X2 Elite. The Extreme gives you about 225, so think of it as an eight-channel DDR and a 12-channel DDR. That's the difference. In technical terms, it gives you more DDR bandwidth. And the reason to do that, obviously, is because many of the AI use cases are DDR-centric.\n\nEverybody's in search of this one AI app that is going to transform. But we believe the workloads are going to get to agentic.\n\nPCMAG: This might be a marketing question. I was looking at the initial three SKUs, and I noticed that the first SKU, the X2 Elite Extreme SKU, is 18-core, with everything else maxed out. The second one is also 18 cores, but not called Extreme. And then the other Elite is a 12-core, right? I was wondering what the marketing logic was of not making the first two 18-core chips both \"Extreme\"?\n\nKONDAP: So the difference is that with the Extreme version, because it's the higher DDR, and it is literally for \"extreme\" use cases, with AI and all of these things. The big difference between the three...all three SKUs support 80 TOPS, but the middle one and the lower one are both eight-channel. So addressability for memory is around 150 gigabits per second, and the Extreme version is the one with 225.\n\nPCMAG: Is the higher GPU performance also tied to the higher memory bandwidth?\n\nKONDAP: No...to be fair, obviously DDR also drives the GPU, drives a lot of the pipeline, drives a lot in terms of the SoC. But that's not why it is. Technically, yes, you are correct that games, or video, or those use cases, will scale because the bandwidth scales. But we've kept the graphics constant. You won't necessarily get to the same output. We just want to have the option available for everybody in case they want to use the 18-core without the extra DDR.\n\nPCMAG: About the Guardian hardware. It was said on stage that there is an SoC element that is part of the Guardian hardware. Is there any way of describing what that is?\n\nKONDAP: It's a dedicated processor within the SoC that's isolated from the rest of the other cores. It has its own BIOS. You can manage the subsystem independently without having to access the rest. So it's a more secure way of how we're able to access an independent processor within the entire SoC.\n\nBattery Life, and Why a Bigger NPU?\n\nWIRED: I noticed there was very little talk about battery life, as opposed to in the first generation—that was, you know, the thing! Anything to say about how different the battery life we're looking at [will be]? Or a kind of parity with the previous generation?\n\nKONDAP: No, it'll be better. We didn't talk in terms of specifics; then, the challenge becomes, what use cases, what do you want to run? With the first generation, we had to showcase stuff because we hadn't launched yet! [Laughter] Now, people have, like the [HP] OmniBook 5, tested out, and the claims that are made with 34 hours of battery life, they're tested. So there are third-party reports that have attested to this incredible battery life. But I showed some of the claims, as you heard; it's depending on which platform you look at: 30%, 40%, 50% better performance in the Extreme at 60% lower power. You will see improvements and gains in battery life, not just in terms of performance. But again, as you know, it's tied to use cases, how people are running it. But we will continue our leadership in performance per watt. We're going to lead the way.\n\nPCMAG: Question on the NPU. We are familiar with how things develop in CPU and GPU, but with NPU development, you're going from one number to a much larger number. How does that happen? What are the factors in chip development that enable an NPU to go from that to that in a generation? Just not being familiar with NPU architecture works.\n\nKONDAP: More details to come on Architecture Day for all of these, but look—AI, and that's why we had Steven [Bathiche] from Microsoft talk about it more technically, because there are things that are moving at such a rapid pace. It's funny, because when we talked about 45 TOPS, and were the first to introduce that in market, everybody said, 45 TOPS? Why do you need 45 TOPS?\n\nI don't know if you guys have had a chance to go through our demo area, but now you have use cases there that are utilizing 100% of our 45 TOPS, right? For example, there's an app called Collov, which basically helps you stage your home. There's no one app that's going to meet everybody's needs, but there are apps that are going to meet every different use case. What's happening is we're seeing this huge demand for NPU workloads.\n\nAt the same time, the models that we've seen have been optimized significantly. For example, when we launched, we talked about a 13-billion-parameter model back then, running on our 45 TOPS NPU with the eight-channel DDR at 130 gigabits per second. Now fast-forward. What has happened in two years is that models have shrunk. What was back then an INT8 model is now an INT4 model, sometimes an INT2 model. The accuracy is still very good. That's what Steven also addressed. We're also able to address bigger models now on the same device. Today, we're able to, in our X1 platform, in many cases, fit like a 27-billion-parameter model.\n\nSo what's happening is we looked at a macro level, at how the industry is shaping with the AI workloads and the models. Then we looked at what we believe is the future, looking at all of these agentic workloads. Let me give you an example. Think of a use case where you're going to tell your PC: Look at my calendar, try to see if I can go to Snapdragon Summit. Am I available that week? And please help me schedule with these five folks, and help me do ABCDE, and give me flight options.\n\nThat use case has multiple agents running on the device. Each agent is different. There's an agent that's looking at your calendar; there's an agent that's looking at the conflicts that somebody else might have. There's an agent that's going to look at your travel preferences and all of that. There's also a hybrid approach to this, because if your preference is Southwest, Alaska, Delta Airlines, whatever, it's going to go in and access the web to see that. OK, John would like to fly on September 20, and it says, \"Well, looks like you can make it. You're supposed to go meet Luke at so-and-so place, but it looks like we can find another option.\"\n\nWhat has happened in two years is that models have shrunk. What was back then an INT8 model is now an INT4 model, sometimes an INT2 model. The accuracy is still very good.\n\nSo those agents—I'm giving you a very rudimentary example—but think of that as workloads where we're building up workloads internally to start modeling. And that, in partnership with Microsoft as well, and looking at partnering with all the model vendors, that's how we sized up the NPU.\n\nThere's more to it. I'm still talking very rudimentary. Now, you think about LVMs [large vision models] and multi-modalities with images and creating videos. Like: I type a text prompt, I want to write a little story, and I want to get it converted into a video. How does that happen? What parts of it run on-device? That's how we start sizing up the NPU and start looking at how we want to architect this. But also the reason why, bringing it back to the higher DDR bandwidth is that we're seeing that use case there. That's why we wanted to have that option available for anybody who needs it.\n\nPCMAG: Is it also a [factor] that multiple AI demands are being made at the same time? So, having a larger NPU enables not only multiple agents, but multiple processes that may be happening in the system at the same time? Being unsure how an NPU works, can it juggle [like a CPU]?\n\nKONDAP: Yeah, it is able to in the same way. And you still have a very powerful CPU and a very powerful GPU, and you have an NPU. So the better part is now if you're offloading all of these tasks, like the agentic stuff, to your NPU, you still have a lot of CPU and GPU headroom left for you to do other tasks, right? You're still going to do your email, you're still going to do other tasks that you want to do that you've offloaded to these other pipelines, including the video and audio and all of that.\n\nWe talked about adding this NPU even to our audio blocks. That's where we look at echo cancellation, background, and all of that stuff. We're going to start running it more on these smaller NPUs. Overall, like I said, that's how we model our use cases right now.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nWIRED: [With NPU], are we still in a sort of \"build it and they will come\" situation? I know that initially, that's what it was, right? You had to get these into these computers before people could start developing. Where are we at right now?\n\nKONDAP: There are more ISVs than we can keep up with right now, the number of ISVs that are wanting to port all their stuff. And you see why specifically these creator workloads—like Ableton Live and with big voice-model stuff—these are very intense things that really do take up a lot of the NPU. And so everybody is moving toward the same thing, like enterprises are moving to agents.\n\nWe have a large customer right now that has moved a lot of their workforce in many areas...all onto agents. Like, they've moved their entire payroll to an agentic AI. There is no more payroll for them. They have, like, one person in payroll. They shrunk it from 11 down to one person. And then making sure that the agents can run payroll, they've linked it up in the back end. There are all these different use cases....I don't have to sit across the table and convince somebody that the future is AI. Those days are past us now.\n\nWIRED: Specifically on-device, right?\n\nKONDAP: It's moving on-device....The example I gave you of writing a little story and then building a video: It costs a lot of money to build that story and build a video from that story if you run it 100% in the cloud. And there's no reason to. But we're not necessarily saying everything's going to run on-device. We're just saying that's the optionality. You have the option to run a hybrid model, where you can run stuff on-device, and other parts in the cloud. That's the beauty of how this industry is going to move.\n\nPCMAG: Is there any world in which applications, AI applications, are load-balancing between the NPU and other parts of the CPU/SoC? Is that currently done today?\n\nKONDAP: Yes, it's done today. OK, but it's more power, right? The reason for the NPU is that it's a lot more power-efficient. Running anything on your NPU helps you with battery life significantly.\n\nPCMAG: And these days, what's managing the traffic around which part of the chip you're using? Is that something that's built into the app, is that something system-level? Who's arbitrating that?\n\nKONDAP: So the OS already has it. Like, we can go to your Task Manager today and see your NPU utilization relative to your CPU and GPU. So you can actually run something and see where it's being run—just the way you could run it earlier on the CPU and GPU, now you can see it on the NPU. From an orchestration standpoint, Microsoft provided—if you guys saw the announcement—Windows ML, so it makes it easier now for developers to have a cross-referenced framework that they can use.\n\nFor Qualcomm, we have our own orchestration framework. So, for example, when an ISV comes in and balances a particular use case, we have the governance in terms of what runs on the CPU, the GPU, or the NPU, or within the NPU, how do we want to run all the models. That governance we already have. We provide the orchestration ourselves.\n\nSnapdragon X, Looking to 2029...\n\nWIRED: Do you have a goal in mind for market share? What would you consider to be a success in this next generation?\n\nKONDAP: We've said our North Star. We said at our investor day, that's $4 billion in 2029.\n\nPCMAG: $4 million by 2029?\n\nKONDAP: $4 billion.\n\nPCMAG: That's a big number. [Laughter.]\n\n(Credit: Qualcomm)\n\nKONDAP: But we're also talking about a different way of how people are going to look at the PC. It's not the same as what we all see today. It will change. The interaction will change. You heard Cristiano [Amon, Qualcomm CEO] saying, \"AI will be the new UI.\" We're seeing it. I can't stress it enough.\n\n(Note: PCMag is attending Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit by invitation, but in keeping with our ethics policy, we have assumed all costs for travel and lodging for the conference.)",

      "headline": "Scalpers sell ROG Xbox Ally X preorders for as much as $2,500 even though they are still in stock — stay away from eBay and buy from retailers",
      "content": "If you're looking at picking up one of the new ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X machines — and we wouldn't blame you, because they do look pretty sweet — we have some advice: namely, don't buy one off eBay. Yes, scalpers are already trying to move pre-orders for the system, and they're pushing them for as much as 2.5 times the manufacturer's suggested retail price of $999 USD. No, we're not kidding; see for yourself.\n\nSeriously, don't buy this. If you really want a ROG Xbox Ally X, head right on over to Best Buy, where you can still pre-order the thing ahead of its October 16 release date for the standard price of $999—a price that's already a little contentious given that performance is likely to be only slightly ahead of the extant $899 ROG Ally X despite that machine being based on the previous-generation Z1 Extreme processor.\n\nDon't mistake us; the ROG Xbox Ally X has a few upgrades over the previous model, like ergonomic handgrips, faster 8-Gbps LPDDR5X memory, and Xbox Series-style Impulse Triggers with haptic feedback. Still, the star of the show is undoubtedly that it debuts the top-end chip in the AMD Ryzen Z2 series, the Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme. This is fundamentally the same processor as the Ryzen Z2 Extreme, but where that chip disables Strix Point's NPU, the version coming in the Microsoft-branded machine retains its NPU functionality for AI features coming in 2026.\n\nCheck out the one \"marked down\" from $3570. (Image credit: eBay)\n\nWe haven't tested the Ryzen Z2 Extreme ourselves yet, but benchmarks out of China for MSI's Claw A8 with the chip put it slightly ahead of Intel's Core Ultra 7 258V in the MSI Claw 8 AI+, although the gap was vanishingly small. Considering that Lunar Lake is often not far ahead of the original Ryzen Z1 Extreme, this mirrors what we've seen in laptops, where the Ryzen AI 300 series' integrated GPU rarely puts much space between itself and the Ryzen AI 200 series, formerly known as the Ryzen 8040 series, codenamed Hawk Point. The Ryzen Z1 Extreme is also Hawk Point.\n\nIf you're really keen for a significant uplift in handheld performance versus the wave of Hawk Point-based machines, like the original ASUS ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, the Ayaneo Kun, the GPD Win 4, and many others, then what you're going to be looking for is a system based on the AMD Ryzen AI Max 300 family. These chips are fundamentally much larger, featuring desktop-class CPU cores, significantly wider GPUs, and a double-wide memory bus to prevent bandwidth bottlenecks.\n\nRyzen AI Max processors are not cheap, and as it happens, many of the systems sporting these SoCs seem to be coming in right around the prices asked by the ROG Xbox Ally X scalpers. If you've got $2,500 to drop on a handheld, maybe check out the GPD Win 5, Ayaneo's Next 2, and the just-announced OneXFly Apex, all of which are based on this chip, codenamed Strix Halo. They're going to offer you real premium features that you won't find on the ROG Xbox Ally X, including OLED screens, detachable batteries, and legitimate console-like performance. Of course, there's the question of whether you should spend $2500 on a machine with console-like performance, but that's your judgment call to make, not ours.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "headline": "AMD's memory patent outlining a 'new, improved RAM' made from DDR5 memory isn't a new development — HB-DIMMs already superseded, probably won't come to market",
      "content": "A recent AMD patent, US19/201,497 titled \"High-bandwidth memory module architecture,\" is making the rounds again, with posts like this one on Reddit prompting all kinds of speculation about the \"new\" HB-DIMM memory technology that AMD is preparing. However, AMD is probably not preparing anything new; Instead, the new patent is actually a continuation of an older one that dates to 2022. The technology the company outlines has already been superseded by the new MRDIMM tech that's already shipping and supported by AMD.\n\nThe original patent, known as US12300346B2 and also titled \"High-bandwidth memory module architecture,\" was superseded in 2023 by US20230178121A1, which is the specific document extended by the \"new\" filing that was actually published back in July. In other words, by no means is this a novel technology, and AMD's recent activity with these patents is almost assuredly a form of \"bureaucratic housekeeping\" — paper shuffling intended to help protect AMD's intellectual property.\n\nSo, what are these patents actually about? HB-DIMMs, a new type of memory module that performs multiplexed accesses over \"two or more independently addressable pseudo-channels\" within a single memory module. These pseudo-channels are not necessarily analogous to memory ranks, but instead separate divisions within the module, and they can be within a single rank or across ranks.\n\nBy doing this, you can double the effective transfer rate of standard DDR5 DRAM, although you will need new modules with extra components, including additional data buffers and an RCD, or Register Clock Driver. This means, in essence, that HB-DIMMs would essentially supersede both standard RDIMMs and CUDIMMs.\n\nMultiple companies independently developed this idea; SK hynix pursued it in collaboration with Intel and Renesas, presenting a proposal called MCR-DIMM in late 2022. That was after AMD had already filed its patent on HB-DIMM, although the filing wasn't public at that time. It wouldn't do to have two competing, incompatible standards, so JEDEC got together with the two to standardize what we now have as MRDIMMs, or Multiplexed-Rank Dual Inline Memory Modules. MRDIMMs consolidate the ideas of MCR-DIMM and HB-DIMM into one standard form.\n\nIntel's Sierra Forest, Granite Rapids, and a Gaudi 3 accelerator, launched last year. (Image credit: Intel)\n\nMRDIMMs aren't a hypothetical future technology. They've already been available on the market for upwards of a year now, as they're supported in Intel's Xeon 6 family of server CPUs (formerly Granite Rapids). Phoronix recently tested the performance gains against standard DDR5 RDIMMs at 6400 Mbps, and while the overall gains were small, certain memory-intensive workloads like the High Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG) found significant gains, while memory latency actually saw a tiny, margin-of-error improvement.\n\nDoes this recent patent filing indicate that AMD will still pursue HB-DIMM? Probably not. Fundamentally, the technologies are very similar, and AMD has already voiced its intent to support JEDEC's MRDIMM open standard. The company's Zen 6-based EPYC 'Venice' processors are expected to use MRDIMMs — potentially second-generation MRDIMMs — to reach the lofty 1.6 TB/second per-socket memory bandwidth spec that Dr. Lisa Su teased at AMD's Advancing AI event in June.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIf that was indeed meant to be a single-socket bandwidth number, then with the rumored sixteen-channel (1024-bit) memory interface of 'Venice', a transfer rate of 12,800 Mbps would get you directly to 1.6 TB/second. That happens to be exactly the transfer rate that JEDEC promised for second-generation MRDIMMs, so there's the source for our speculation.\n\nMRDIMMs are currently quite expensive, at least at retail (Image credit: Server Supply)\n\nThose hot-clocked DDR5 modules won't come cheap, though. Existing MRDIMMs are already extremely expensive, with a cost-per-gigabyte that is between 28% and 114% higher than standard, slower-clocked DDR5 RDIMMs, depending on the specific comparison being made. We're looking at retail pricing, which usually isn't what server operators pay, but the point is, you're looking at easily $100 to $150 extra per module, which is brutal when you need to fill eight, ten, twelve, or sixteen memory channels in a single server. The second-gen 12,800 Mbps stuff will likely be even more.\n\nSo, in summary: No, AMD (probably) isn't about to whip out some new high-speed memory technology. This stuff has been talked about for a few years already, and in fact, we actually covered HB-DIMM and MRDIMMs right here on this very website in the past. Here's hoping this technology could filter down to consumer systems, particularly if those rumors about AMD's new chiplet APUs are true.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "content": "Table of Contents Market Successes for Snapdragon X So Far About Snapdragon Guardian Some SoC Particulars Market Positioning for the New X2 Chips Battery Life, and Why a Bigger NPU? Snapdragon X, Looking to 2029...\n\nDon't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google.\n\nLAHAINA, MAUI—The highlight of this year's Snapdragon Summit is the unveiling of Qualcomm's second-generation Snapdragon X2 Arm laptop processors, including a new \"Extreme\" tier of chips that looks poised to take on AMD's, Intel's, and Apple's best. PCs with the new X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme processors won't appear until the first half of 2026, but Qualcomm is setting some great expectations: 18-core and 12-core processors with serious multicore CPU muscle, a field-leading TOPS count on its neural processor (an 80 TOPS NPU), and a redesigned graphics core.\n\nWith Intel on the ropes but now poised to work more closely than ever with Nvidia on co-designed \"RTX\" SoCs, with AMD benefitting from the power vacuum left by Intel, and with Apple Silicon going strong, it's the wildest time ever to cover laptop processors. PCMag's John Burek and Wired's Luke Larsen were given the opportunity to sit down with one of the company’s senior executives to chat about the new Snapdragon X2 Elite family. We quizzed Kedar Kondap, SVP and GM of Qualcomm's Compute division, on various aspects of the new X2 chips: their makeup, the new Snapdragon Guardian tech designed to appeal to enterprise, and how to cool these fierce-looking chips. The interview has been slightly edited and shortened for clarity.\n\nMarket Successes for Snapdragon X So Far\n\nPCMAG: We've seen various numbers from different sources—adoption numbers relative to the rest of the market—for the initial Snapdragon X Elite. Do you have anything that you can, want, or are able to share in terms of market percentages, numbers in terms of units sold, things of that sort?\n\nKONDAP: I can get you the right numbers that we've shared publicly, but we announced that at earnings. When you look at categories where we were focused—which is devices that are thin-and-light, $600 and above, with integrated GPU—in certain markets I think we've done really well...\n\nSo, approximately 9% of Windows laptops above $600 in the US and the top five European countries. These are the regions we focused on primarily in the first launch. We wanted to make sure that we were focused in how we delivered X Elite into the market. And it was staggered, right? We launched X Elite in June 2024; we launched X Plus devices in September at IFA last year; and then the X came in January. We announced in January, and devices came a little bit after that.\n\nWIRED: I'm curious—you probably don't have the numbers for this—about consumer purchases. Obviously, with some of the stuff announced, you are trying to push into enterprise more, which is where the big numbers are. Can you talk about how you are doing for consumers, people buying directly from stores and online?\n\nKONDAP: Yeah. The market, as you put it, is segmented between consumer and commercial. We focused the first launches on consumer. We've done a lot of pilots and enterprise trials. Those are in progress. We're a lead partner, in IT, ourselves. We've deployed more than 16,000 laptops at Qualcomm, so we're obviously leading the wave here. From a consumer standpoint, your question was more around, how did we approach the consumer segment?\n\nWIRED: I'm just wondering if you guys are doing better in that specific target [market] than enterprise?\n\nKONDAP: So our first focus was that we targeted consumer. Look at the investments and the strategy that we had. Products were very consumer-focused. We partnered with retailers, consumer retailers, globally. We had 50-plus retailers that we partnered with to have devices available. We focused on OEM dotcom channels. So, like, all of the OEM channels had devices. We announced more than 9,300 stores, and some of them even had a Snapdragon-branded kiosk. And the reason for us to do that is to build a relationship with the consumer. We wanted the consumer to understand: One, to understand the brand, but second, also to understand these experiences. The AI stuff is new, and there's not one specific app, or one use case, that's going to fit everybody....\n\nBut in parallel, we have started enterprise trials. Like I said, Qualcomm has led the way, but we have other partners like SAP and many others that have already deployed or are testing actively. We know that takes a little bit longer. Part of why we introduced Snapdragon Guardian today is to showcase more benefits to enterprises and what we can offer.\n\nAbout Snapdragon Guardian\n\nWIRED: I assume Guardian will be offered in all laptops, not just those sold directly into commercial?\n\nKONDAP: The use cases—obviously, it depends. For example, an OEM wants to sell it into the consumer space and add a capability with Guardian. You have the ability to track a PC, manage a PC. I'll give you a good use case.\n\nKids, for example, right? Many schools allow for kids to carry laptops, but they don't allow them to carry phones. So great use case: You know, today, on phones, people have Life360, or one of these apps that you can track where your kids are. You can geofence stuff. Think of it as something very similar. You have the ability to geofence where your kids are, have it on a laptop, and be able to manage it remotely. You can access what they're doing. So we want to give that control to consumers. So it's both a consumer and a commercial thing—but obviously it benefits largely commercial enterprises.\n\nWIRED: Will it be that when people buy those laptops, will they experience that? As in, are OEMs going to use that technology, then rebrand it? Or are we going to see it directly, like a feature in every laptop?\n\nKONDAP: I don't think we're ready to talk about that yet. But we wanted to showcase the technology and what we built because we have added the Guardian technology as a separate subsystem in our platform. So we've taken the steps to make sure that it is a secure subsystem within our SoC, and it provides the ability for our OEM partners to build on top of that. They can choose to offer it either in consumer or commercial. We're providing the foundation, if you will.\n\nPCMAG: About the Guardian stuff, I heard a mention in the presentation that it would be available even if the system was powered off. I was trying to figure out how that works. Are you able to talk on that?\n\nKONDAP: It is a separate subsystem within the SoC, and it connects to a cellular modem. The whole system stays in a low-power island. You can wake the modem up, which will wake up the subsystem. Now, as you know, that can go through multiple scenarios—like, for example, if it's a dead-battery situation, then obviously you can't do anything about it. But then, at the same time, our intent is offering this to enterprise or IT administrators. We want to give them the control to manage devices better, and the risk of a malicious attack is low if you're in a dead-battery situation. So as long as the user plugs in the laptop and brings it up to a certain threshold of battery, you have the ability to wake it up and just push a patch, or be able to do any activities...\n\nPCMAG: Disable it, or whatever the case.\n\nKONDAP: It's totally up to the IT administrators.\n\nSome SoC Particulars\n\nPCMAG: Question on the SoC. I was looking at the specs we were given and noticed that there were different memory allocations for the three different X2 SKUs announced so far. The first, the Elite Extreme, is at 48GB. The others were listed as \"device-dependent.\" And I was just wondering why the 48GB ceiling was landed upon. Any particular reason?\n\nKONDAP: I think the X2 Elite Extreme devices you saw, that we were running, had 48GB of memory. Honestly, we just picked the 48GB because that is still a pretty sweet spot. There's no science behind it. The X2 Elite can address up to 128GB. 48GB is already big for most users. So there's no science behind why we picked that.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nPCMAG: Is there anything you can speak to in terms of the Adreno GPU? The efficiency gains that were claimed on stage today are pretty impressive. And any insight into how you got to that point versus the first gen?\n\nKONDAP: It's a completely new Adreno GPU, designed ground up for this stuff. It has a new architecture, better shader pipelines. The entire GPU is new. It's not iterative. It is a new generation. And of course, if you're able to attend the sessions after this, we will go into a lot more technical details on exactly how it is done. But yes, it's a completely new architecture, and that's how we're able to get the performance gains as well as the power efficiency.\n\nPCMAG: One other thing that came up when I was talking with some of the folks in the benchmarking session that we had yesterday. The two reference desktops shown—I understand that they're being cooled with AirJet—Frore Systems' AirJet cooling—one of the reps told me?\n\nKONDAP: We have the option to do both. I should say, technically, you have the option to do three things. One, you can have the option to enable this with a fanless design. You can get close to at least 12 watts TDP, if not a little bit more. Or, you can use a regular fan. Or, you can use AirJet. And so, right now, we have two of the SKUs, I believe, that we're showing here. One of the designs is fanless, and the other one has AirJet, which gives you close to 25 watts TDP.\n\nIt's just an option that we want to showcase—that in the same X2 Elite or the X2 Elite Extreme, you can utilize the entire benefit and choose your design points, no different than laptops. And you can tell when you look at the form factors, the difference is insignificant in terms of what you can do, but you can still get 25 watts of performance at very low power.\n\nPCMAG: Thoughts on using AirJet outside of these desktops, in things like laptops? There's no reason you couldn't do that?\n\nKONDAP: No restriction. We just showcased this technology in the small form factors.\n\nMarket Positioning for the New X2 Chips\n\nWIRED: Can you talk about who the X2 Elite Extreme is for, and the thought behind offering that as a separate configuration?\n\nKONDAP: There's swim lanes, right? You have certain price points in certain swim lanes. The X1 Elite was in the price band, or I'll say the sweet spot, of $1,000 device SPs. Think of the X2 Elite as something very similar to that. The Extreme version with the 18-core CPU, with the much higher graphics core, will address a higher tier of experiences. That's part of why we focus so much on talking about gaming and creator use cases. We want to start showcasing the performance, and that's where you get the true benefit of running stuff.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nEverybody's in search of this one AI app that is going to transform. But we believe the workloads are going to get to agentic. And as you start looking at the whole scenario, all these different agents running on the device, we believe that it's going to run across all the different cores (obviously, on the NPU for low power), and it's going to run hybrid as necessary....Same reason why, for example, we added an 80 TOPS NPU. We believe that we're capping out in terms of many of the use cases that we're running, even at 45 TOPS. So we're enhancing leadership in each of those areas.\n\nWIRED: The 80 TOPS will be across the lineup, right? In the same way that 50 TOPS is across the [current Snapdragon X] lineup?\n\nKONDAP: We're keeping it constant. But the memory is different. In the X2 Elite and the X2 Elite Extreme, the memory configurations are different. DDR—the available bandwidth is different.\n\nFor example, you can address close to about 150, 152, gigabits per second in the X2 Elite. The Extreme gives you about 225, so think of it as an eight-channel DDR and a 12-channel DDR. That's the difference. In technical terms, it gives you more DDR bandwidth. And the reason to do that, obviously, is because many of the AI use cases are DDR-centric.\n\nEverybody's in search of this one AI app that is going to transform. But we believe the workloads are going to get to agentic.\n\nPCMAG: This might be a marketing question. I was looking at the initial three SKUs, and I noticed that the first SKU, the X2 Elite Extreme SKU, is 18-core, with everything else maxed out. The second one is also 18 cores, but not called Extreme. And then the other Elite is a 12-core, right? I was wondering what the marketing logic was of not making the first two 18-core chips both \"Extreme\"?\n\nKONDAP: So the difference is that with the Extreme version, because it's the higher DDR, and it is literally for \"extreme\" use cases, with AI and all of these things. The big difference between the three...all three SKUs support 80 TOPS, but the middle one and the lower one are both eight-channel. So addressability for memory is around 150 gigabits per second, and the Extreme version is the one with 225.\n\nPCMAG: Is the higher GPU performance also tied to the higher memory bandwidth?\n\nKONDAP: No...to be fair, obviously DDR also drives the GPU, drives a lot of the pipeline, drives a lot in terms of the SoC. But that's not why it is. Technically, yes, you are correct that games, or video, or those use cases, will scale because the bandwidth scales. But we've kept the graphics constant. You won't necessarily get to the same output. We just want to have the option available for everybody in case they want to use the 18-core without the extra DDR.\n\nPCMAG: About the Guardian hardware. It was said on stage that there is an SoC element that is part of the Guardian hardware. Is there any way of describing what that is?\n\nKONDAP: It's a dedicated processor within the SoC that's isolated from the rest of the other cores. It has its own BIOS. You can manage the subsystem independently without having to access the rest. So it's a more secure way of how we're able to access an independent processor within the entire SoC.\n\nBattery Life, and Why a Bigger NPU?\n\nWIRED: I noticed there was very little talk about battery life, as opposed to in the first generation—that was, you know, the thing! Anything to say about how different the battery life we're looking at [will be]? Or a kind of parity with the previous generation?\n\nKONDAP: No, it'll be better. We didn't talk in terms of specifics; then, the challenge becomes, what use cases, what do you want to run? With the first generation, we had to showcase stuff because we hadn't launched yet! [Laughter] Now, people have, like the [HP] OmniBook 5, tested out, and the claims that are made with 34 hours of battery life, they're tested. So there are third-party reports that have attested to this incredible battery life. But I showed some of the claims, as you heard; it's depending on which platform you look at: 30%, 40%, 50% better performance in the Extreme at 60% lower power. You will see improvements and gains in battery life, not just in terms of performance. But again, as you know, it's tied to use cases, how people are running it. But we will continue our leadership in performance per watt. We're going to lead the way.\n\nPCMAG: Question on the NPU. We are familiar with how things develop in CPU and GPU, but with NPU development, you're going from one number to a much larger number. How does that happen? What are the factors in chip development that enable an NPU to go from that to that in a generation? Just not being familiar with NPU architecture works.\n\nKONDAP: More details to come on Architecture Day for all of these, but look—AI, and that's why we had Steven [Bathiche] from Microsoft talk about it more technically, because there are things that are moving at such a rapid pace. It's funny, because when we talked about 45 TOPS, and were the first to introduce that in market, everybody said, 45 TOPS? Why do you need 45 TOPS?\n\nI don't know if you guys have had a chance to go through our demo area, but now you have use cases there that are utilizing 100% of our 45 TOPS, right? For example, there's an app called Collov, which basically helps you stage your home. There's no one app that's going to meet everybody's needs, but there are apps that are going to meet every different use case. What's happening is we're seeing this huge demand for NPU workloads.\n\nAt the same time, the models that we've seen have been optimized significantly. For example, when we launched, we talked about a 13-billion-parameter model back then, running on our 45 TOPS NPU with the eight-channel DDR at 130 gigabits per second. Now fast-forward. What has happened in two years is that models have shrunk. What was back then an INT8 model is now an INT4 model, sometimes an INT2 model. The accuracy is still very good. That's what Steven also addressed. We're also able to address bigger models now on the same device. Today, we're able to, in our X1 platform, in many cases, fit like a 27-billion-parameter model.\n\nSo what's happening is we looked at a macro level, at how the industry is shaping with the AI workloads and the models. Then we looked at what we believe is the future, looking at all of these agentic workloads. Let me give you an example. Think of a use case where you're going to tell your PC: Look at my calendar, try to see if I can go to Snapdragon Summit. Am I available that week? And please help me schedule with these five folks, and help me do ABCDE, and give me flight options.\n\nThat use case has multiple agents running on the device. Each agent is different. There's an agent that's looking at your calendar; there's an agent that's looking at the conflicts that somebody else might have. There's an agent that's going to look at your travel preferences and all of that. There's also a hybrid approach to this, because if your preference is Southwest, Alaska, Delta Airlines, whatever, it's going to go in and access the web to see that. OK, John would like to fly on September 20, and it says, \"Well, looks like you can make it. You're supposed to go meet Luke at so-and-so place, but it looks like we can find another option.\"\n\nWhat has happened in two years is that models have shrunk. What was back then an INT8 model is now an INT4 model, sometimes an INT2 model. The accuracy is still very good.\n\nSo those agents—I'm giving you a very rudimentary example—but think of that as workloads where we're building up workloads internally to start modeling. And that, in partnership with Microsoft as well, and looking at partnering with all the model vendors, that's how we sized up the NPU.\n\nThere's more to it. I'm still talking very rudimentary. Now, you think about LVMs [large vision models] and multi-modalities with images and creating videos. Like: I type a text prompt, I want to write a little story, and I want to get it converted into a video. How does that happen? What parts of it run on-device? That's how we start sizing up the NPU and start looking at how we want to architect this. But also the reason why, bringing it back to the higher DDR bandwidth is that we're seeing that use case there. That's why we wanted to have that option available for anybody who needs it.\n\nPCMAG: Is it also a [factor] that multiple AI demands are being made at the same time? So, having a larger NPU enables not only multiple agents, but multiple processes that may be happening in the system at the same time? Being unsure how an NPU works, can it juggle [like a CPU]?\n\nKONDAP: Yeah, it is able to in the same way. And you still have a very powerful CPU and a very powerful GPU, and you have an NPU. So the better part is now if you're offloading all of these tasks, like the agentic stuff, to your NPU, you still have a lot of CPU and GPU headroom left for you to do other tasks, right? You're still going to do your email, you're still going to do other tasks that you want to do that you've offloaded to these other pipelines, including the video and audio and all of that.\n\nWe talked about adding this NPU even to our audio blocks. That's where we look at echo cancellation, background, and all of that stuff. We're going to start running it more on these smaller NPUs. Overall, like I said, that's how we model our use cases right now.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nWIRED: [With NPU], are we still in a sort of \"build it and they will come\" situation? I know that initially, that's what it was, right? You had to get these into these computers before people could start developing. Where are we at right now?\n\nKONDAP: There are more ISVs than we can keep up with right now, the number of ISVs that are wanting to port all their stuff. And you see why specifically these creator workloads—like Ableton Live and with big voice-model stuff—these are very intense things that really do take up a lot of the NPU. And so everybody is moving toward the same thing, like enterprises are moving to agents.\n\nWe have a large customer right now that has moved a lot of their workforce in many areas...all onto agents. Like, they've moved their entire payroll to an agentic AI. There is no more payroll for them. They have, like, one person in payroll. They shrunk it from 11 down to one person. And then making sure that the agents can run payroll, they've linked it up in the back end. There are all these different use cases....I don't have to sit across the table and convince somebody that the future is AI. Those days are past us now.\n\nWIRED: Specifically on-device, right?\n\nKONDAP: It's moving on-device....The example I gave you of writing a little story and then building a video: It costs a lot of money to build that story and build a video from that story if you run it 100% in the cloud. And there's no reason to. But we're not necessarily saying everything's going to run on-device. We're just saying that's the optionality. You have the option to run a hybrid model, where you can run stuff on-device, and other parts in the cloud. That's the beauty of how this industry is going to move.\n\nPCMAG: Is there any world in which applications, AI applications, are load-balancing between the NPU and other parts of the CPU/SoC? Is that currently done today?\n\nKONDAP: Yes, it's done today. OK, but it's more power, right? The reason for the NPU is that it's a lot more power-efficient. Running anything on your NPU helps you with battery life significantly.\n\nPCMAG: And these days, what's managing the traffic around which part of the chip you're using? Is that something that's built into the app, is that something system-level? Who's arbitrating that?\n\nKONDAP: So the OS already has it. Like, we can go to your Task Manager today and see your NPU utilization relative to your CPU and GPU. So you can actually run something and see where it's being run—just the way you could run it earlier on the CPU and GPU, now you can see it on the NPU. From an orchestration standpoint, Microsoft provided—if you guys saw the announcement—Windows ML, so it makes it easier now for developers to have a cross-referenced framework that they can use.\n\nFor Qualcomm, we have our own orchestration framework. So, for example, when an ISV comes in and balances a particular use case, we have the governance in terms of what runs on the CPU, the GPU, or the NPU, or within the NPU, how do we want to run all the models. That governance we already have. We provide the orchestration ourselves.\n\nSnapdragon X, Looking to 2029...\n\nWIRED: Do you have a goal in mind for market share? What would you consider to be a success in this next generation?\n\nKONDAP: We've said our North Star. We said at our investor day, that's $4 billion in 2029.\n\nPCMAG: $4 million by 2029?\n\nKONDAP: $4 billion.\n\nPCMAG: That's a big number. [Laughter.]\n\n(Credit: Qualcomm)\n\nKONDAP: But we're also talking about a different way of how people are going to look at the PC. It's not the same as what we all see today. It will change. The interaction will change. You heard Cristiano [Amon, Qualcomm CEO] saying, \"AI will be the new UI.\" We're seeing it. I can't stress it enough.\n\n(Note: PCMag is attending Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit by invitation, but in keeping with our ethics policy, we have assumed all costs for travel and lodging for the conference.)",

      "headline": "Nvidia CEO bets $100 billion on OpenAI becoming a multi-trillion-dollar company — Jensen outlines his view on OpenAI's path to becoming one of the biggest companies in the world",
      "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes OpenAI is on track to become a multi-trillion-dollar company, citing explosive growth and scale as the foundation for what could be the fastest rise to that valuation in the industry’s history. Speaking on the BG2 podcast, Huang said that OpenAI “is likely going to be the next multi-trillion-dollar hyperscaler company.”\n\nHis comments come on the heels of a high-stakes infrastructure pact between Nvidia and OpenAI. Earlier this week, the companies announced a letter of intent for up to 10 GW of GPU-powered data centers to be deployed through OpenAI’s preferred cloud partners. Nvidia, in turn, agreed to invest as much as $100 billion in those systems as capacity comes online, making it one of the largest vendor-led bets on AI infrastructure to date.\n\nIn doing so, Nvidia is effectively underwriting the next generation of AI growth by ensuring its silicon roadmap stays in sync with OpenAI’s compute ambitions. The deal anchors future demand for Nvidia’s Rubin-class platforms and next-gen networking hardware, while also giving OpenAI early access to systems that may not reach general availability for years.\n\nIt also helps to bolster Nvidia’s dominance in the AI supply chain. Major cloud providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, have an insatiable appetite for GPU capacity, and Nvidia’s partnership strategy effectively pulls demand forward, locking hyperscalers like them into multi-year commitments while competitors like AMD and Intel are still playing catch-up. Expand the tweet below to see Jensen's explanation of OpenAI's path to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation.\n\n📁 Jensen Huang believes OpenAI is the next trillion-dollar company, and that’s why he’s investing. pic.twitter.com/bwI3ELEa4tSeptember 26, 2025\n\nAt 10 GW, OpenAI’s planned footprint and its associated capital expenditure have already pushed the plans into high-risk, high-reward territory. OpenAI recently struck a $6.5 billion expansion deal with CoreWeave, one of Nvidia’s key hosting partners, to help finance the rollout.\n\nNvidia also holds a stake in CoreWeave, and critics have raised concerns about the concentration of capital, hardware, and access among a small number of companies. However, that doesn’t seem to matter to Huang, who apparently believes that AI’s future will be defined by those who can scale infrastructure the fastest. OpenAI is outpacing even the most aggressive growth curves seen during the rise of cloud computing.\n\nNvidia’s ability to pre-sell entire generations of high-end GPUs into AI deployments will also have knock-on effects on the wider industry, including gaming card availability and workstation pricing. If OpenAI consumes a significant portion of future Rubin or Rubin Ultra supply, it could widen the gap between data center and consumer release cycles, making it even harder for consumers to obtain timely access to Nvidia’s latest hardware.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

      "headline": "Superintelligence is Beyond Reach",
      "content": "Superintelligence is Beyond Reach\n\nWhat’s the latest breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI)? The answer may surprise you.\n\nWe’re all aware of the boom in AI-related stocks, AI technology and unrelenting news coverage about AI. You can’t open your browser without reading about AI and you can’t glance at your stock ticker without noticing the extent to which stock prices have been driven by AI company valuations. That boom may be a bubble but it need not change soon. Stock bubbles have a life of their own and don’t crash just because investors know it’s a bubble.\n\nThat said, there’s no doubt about the power of AI. It’s ubiquitous. It’s on the dashboard of your car, in your home appliances and in the palm of your hand in the form of AI apps. Every internet service provider has one from Microsoft, to Google, Facebook, Apple and OpenAI. When you open your refrigerator and a sign tells you to change your water filter, that’s AI at work.\n\nOf course, AI has been around since the 1950s. AI imitates the human brain by setting up neural networks. These networks have nodes that are connected to each other by what are called edges. The nodes contain mathematical formulas that process incoming data. The processed data then forms the output, which goes to another node.\n\nThe edges can be assigned weights with some inputs being more powerful than others. Nodal output can be arranged in tiers so that lower tier output goes upstream to higher tiers where more input/output processing takes place. Today, these neural networks can be unimaginably complex with billions of nodes processing hundreds of billions of inputs.\n\nAI Advances\n\nAI science hit a dead-end in the early 1980s due to limitations on processing power and the relatively primitive channels through which the processing was done. The 1980s were known as the “AI winter.” This lack of progress in AI science prevailed through the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBeginning around 2005, three major advances occurred that enabled the AI revolution we see today. The first was a dramatic increase in processing power. Faster semiconductor chips from NVIDIA and AMD designed for gaming were adapted to AI processing with great success.\n\nThe second was the invention of large language models (LLMs). These are algorithms that allow AI systems to scan billions of pages of content (including the entire internet), tokenize words, phrases and images and look for clusters of words and images that typically go together. These word and image combinations are assigned values and assembled into clouds that allow systems to fetch them as needed for grammatical writing and composite image creation.\n\nThe third breakthrough was the invention of generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) that allow processors to work in parallel rather than sequentially. The parallel threads converge at the end of the process, but the convergence contains much more refined data due to the transformer method. GPT also acts as a kind of turbocharger on the high-speed chips so that the combined leap in processing speed is exponential.\n\nIt was in November 2022 with the release of Chat GPT-4 by OpenAI (which gained 100 million users in less than 30 days) that the advances described above came together and launched the stock frenzy and the tech advances we’re still seeing.\n\nSuperintelligence Is Beyond Reach\n\nThe difficulty today is that all these advances and the AI boom in general have been extrapolated beyond the ability of the technology to perform. Talk of superintelligence or advanced general intelligence under which humans would be to computers what apes are to humans in terms of cognitive skills is nonsense. Computers may get faster and robots more common, but we won’t see true superintelligence perhaps ever.\n\nThe reason has to do with the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning on the one hand, which computers can do within limits, and abductive logic and semiotics, which are important human skills that computers cannot do at all. These skills are non-programmable and mark one of the key distinctions between human brain functions and computer processing.\n\nOther constraints involve functions of the law of diminishing marginal returns under which massive increases in energy inputs and processing power result in only minor increases in output. Major tech companies (Microsoft, Meta, Google, OpenAI, Apple, Oracle and a few others) have spent over $400 billion for data centers and other AI infrastructure in the past year with higher expenditures planned. This can be considered money spent on hardware.\n\nSoftware development costs and costs of information input are additional expenditures. Increased processing capacity has not been met with increased output. Profits remain elusive. In fact, new applications such as GPT-5 from OpenAI have been major disappointments. This phenomenon of diminishing returns is well-known to engineers in other fields but may come as a shock to AI investors driven by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).\n\nAnother constraint that is little understood is the Law of Conservation of Information in Search Processes. This law has been rigorously demonstrated mathematically by my collaborator William A. Dembski in a recently published paper. The law posits that any search process (including the most sophisticated version of AI) with the fastest processors and LLMs cannot find new information. They can only find existing information.\n\nAI may produce faster and more extensive searches and may find correlations that human efforts could not identify in a lifetime, but that’s all still existing information. In short, AI has no creative capacity. It cannot “think” of anything new, unlike humans who create new formulas and works of art routinely. AI is not “intelligent” or creative. It’s just fast.\n\nIn a recent experiment, a supercomputer and a group of first grade children were given a ruler, a teapot and a stove and asked to draw a circle. The computer “knew” that the ruler was a draftsman’s tool not unlike a compass and promptly tried to draw a circle with a ruler. It failed. The children glanced at the teapot, saw that the bottom was round and used it to trace perfect circles.\n\nThis is an example of abductive logic (also called intuition or common sense) at work, which children have, and computers do not. The idea of children outperforming a supercomputer might cause investors to ask just what they are getting for their $400 billion (and counting).\n\nIn sum, AI will never be superintelligent, expenditures have hit the wall of diminishing returns, AI offers no creativity at all (just fast searches), and children can outperform the fastest machines when the task calls for intuition. Is the AI frenzy about to hit the wall?\n\nScaling Down The Data\n\nThere are some encouraging solutions that may allow AI to add value beyond robotics and fast processing. One of these is the use of small language models (SLMs) instead of LLMs.\n\nUnlike LLMs, which troll the entire internet or large subsets, SLMs contain far less data and are curated by subject matter experts to be tailored to specific tasks. What is the point of including billions of pages of text in a training set if most of those pages have nothing to do with the problem the AI application is trying to solve? As the IBM head of AI research David Cox recently said, “Your HR chatbot doesn’t need to know advanced physics.”\n\nOne difference between SLMs and LLMs is the number of parameters that the model is trained on. LLMs use hundreds of billions of parameters while SLMs might need only 40 billion or fewer parameters. Some SLMs use as few as 1 billion. This means the SLMs can run faster on far less energy. They can also be scaled more easily for smart phones and other applications like self-driving cars and household appliances.\n\nSLMs also have fewer “hallucinations” than LLMs (this refers to the tendency of AI to invent data from whole cloth in order to reply to a prompt or complete an otherwise unfinished narrative). SLMs are less likely to train on the output from LLMs that pollutes the training set. Research shows, as LLMs increasingly train on data sets that include prior output of LLMs, the training set becomes diluted with bad output, and the output quickly crashes into absurd results. SLMs are more resistant to this because their training sets are more technically rigorous.\n\nSLMs also run on less expensive chips, which may have negative implications for monster chip makers like NVIDIA. SLMs running on smaller cloud systems may make the massive server farms now being constructed, either redundant or obsolete.\n\nSLMs are good news for developers and users but may be very bad news for investors who have bet on the firms building massive data centers using super-fast chips and LLMs. All stock bubbles burst eventually. The countdown for the AI tech bubble collapse may have begun.",

      "headline": "Your cameras have been delivered!",
      "content": "AI: enough! Topic: technology, general, opinion Link here\n\nSunday's detailed investigation of generative artificial intelligence should have been enough, but it occurred to me that there was one thing I hadn't tried: graphics. OK, draw me a caricature of Greg Lehey.\n\nGoogle Gemini came up with this:\n\nOf course I don't need to like the results, but this shows very little understanding: no mention of BSD, just Linux (or even “Linix”). Yvonne tells me that it looks nothing like me. Compared to the text results, quite disappointing.\n\nAnd that was all. My other bots all couldn't do it. But their attempts were worth mentioning:\n\nChatAI\n\nI'm unable to draw images directly, but I can help you imagine a caricature of Greg Lehey! Picture a gentleman with a thoughtful expression, perhaps with glasses perched on his nose, and a hint of a smile suggesting a keen sense of humor. His hair might be slightly tousled, giving him a scholarly yet approachable look. You could exaggerate his features, like giving him a larger forehead to symbolize his intellect or a prominent chin to represent determination. Add a background filled with books and computers to reflect his interests in technology and writing\n\nI suppose that's acceptable for as far as it goes.\n\nClaude\n\nClaude did the best with the diary entry, but it failed completely with the caricature:\n\nClaude: I'd be happy to help you create a caricature, but I'll need a bit more information! There are likely multiple people named Greg Lehey, and I want to make sure I'm drawing the right person..\n\nClaude, you know who I am. There are “likely” multiple people named Greg Lehey? That wasn't a problem on Sunday. And as it happens, there is nobody else that I can find with the same name as mine. But OK, draw me a caricature of Greg Lehey, the FreeBSD person.\n\nI can't create visual caricatures or drawings as I'm a text-based AI. However, I'd be happy to help you in other ways: Written description: I could write a humorous written \"caricature\" or character sketch of Greg Lehman (assuming you meant Greg Lehman, a notable FreeBSD contributor) that captures his programming style, contributions to FreeBSD, or personality traits in an exaggerated, caricature-like way.\n\nWhat a cop-out! Now it says that it can't draw. And it comes up with a fictive Greg Lehman. That's completely useless.\n\nDeepSeek\n\nAs before, DeepSeek is inventive:\n\nWhile I can't physically draw for you, I can create a detailed \"blueprint\" for a caricature of the legendary BSD developer Greg \"Groggy\" Lehey. An artist could follow this description to create the perfect caricature. Here is a description designed for an artist to illustrate. Caricature of Greg \"Groggy\" Lehey Concept: The caricature should capture his iconic, jovial, and slightly mischievous personality, deeply intertwined with his life's work: BSD and Unix. Key Features to Exaggerate: The Beard and Hair: This is the #1 feature. Exaggerate his magnificent, full, and sprawling white beard. Make it vast and wizard-like, almost as if it's its own entity. It should be big enough to have a Daemon (the BSD logo) peeking out from within the whiskers, as if it lives there. His hair (what's visible under his hat) should be similarly wild and unkempt. The Headwear: He is almost never seen without a hat. Draw a slightly battered, well-loved flat cap or a beret perched on his head at a jaunty angle. Where did it get the hat from? I am almost never seen with a hat. The Expression: A wide, knowing, and cheerful grin. His eyes should be crinkled with laughter and wisdom, suggesting he's both a kind mentor and someone who knows where all the bugs in the code are hidden. The Props & Surroundings: In his hand: Instead of a coffee mug, he should be holding a massive, steaming beer stein. This is a nod to his famous \"Buy me a beer\" link on his website and his good-humored nature. Steaming beer? I can't even imagine that. And instead of referring to my brewing activities, it refers to a fictive “buy me a beer” link, which may be related to Poul-Henning Kamp. Under his arm: A well-worn copy of his magnum opus, \"The Complete FreeBSD\" book. Background Element: Have a Tux (the Linux penguin) peeking from around a corner, looking slightly nervous or annoyed, while Groggy pays it no mind. This playfully hints at the good-natured rivalry between BSD and Linux. Code: Faint lines of C code ( #include <beard.h> , printf(\"Cheers!\n\n\"); ) can be subtly woven into the texture of his shirt or the background. Overall Vibe: The image should feel warm, intelligent, and full of character. He is the friendly, brilliant, and slightly eccentric \"Unix Beard\" wizard, a beloved figure in the open-source community. Color Palette: Warm tones. Earthy browns for the hat, a rich color for the shirt (green or blue), the brilliant white of the beard, and the gold of the beer.\n\nStill, I suppose that could produce something useful. But where are all the image generators? Do I want to look? I've spent enough time on this already.\n\nWhy don't people read any more? Topic: language, general, technology, opinion Link here\n\nRecently I saw (but didn't read) a newspaper article, possibly from the New York Times, asking why people don't read books any more. The answer appears simple: information overload. When I was a lad I read lots of books, but it has been some time since I finished reading any, and then the relatively thin “Brave New World”.\n\nBut then we watched A Town Like Alice, and Yvonne borrowed the book. I have always liked Nevil Shute, and I have a number of his books, so I read it when she finished. It took me two weeks. While reading I was continually following up on details mentioned in the book—that's what the web is for, after all. In general, I ended up with a much broader view than I would have had if I had just read the book.\n\nAnd how did I like it? Not much. Clearly it's two different stories stuck together: the ordeals in Malaya at the hand of the Japanese occupation and the transformation of a tiny bush village in Queensland into a small town. The latter, in particular, seems very improbable.\n\nThe geographical details are what interested me most. Particularly in Malay(si)a I knew most of the real places. But I'm puzzled about why Shute spends a lot of time in the area Maran and Jerantut in the Jengka Triangle, places that must have been almost completely unknown at the time, but puts the women in a place called Kuala Telang “about half-way between Kuantan and Kota Bahru”. There is a town in that position, but it's called Kuala Terengganu, and it's a big town (capital of the state of Terengganu), not a small village. My guess is that Shute had never heard of it.\n\nSpelling is also strange. In the first half of the book, Kota Bharu was spelt “Kota Bahru”, and in the second half “Khota Bahru”. Tennant Creek became “Tennants Creek”. These spellings are the same both in the online book and the physical book that I read. And there are a couple of irritating US Americanisms that I don't understand: the animals central to the theme are called alligators, not crocodiles. The stockmen use lariats.\n\nThen there's the question of racial attitudes. The local aborigines (or aboriginals, to use the modern politically correct term) are called “boongs” or “abos”. Both are offensive nowadays. And there was talk of racial segregation, a separate milk bar for the boongs. This would have been about 1948, the time of my birth. Did such segregation really exist then?\n\nMy favourite one, though, is when the main characters (Jean and Joe) fall in love, and she decides not to sleep with him until after they are married. Given that Joe had been crucified in the first half of the story, I was half guessing that he might have been castrated at the same time, and Jean would not have found out until too late.\n\nIn summary: reading books has become much more of an exercise than it used to be. For light entertainment we have TV. I don't think I'll read another novel for some time to come.\n\nPredicting the past Topic: general, technology, opinion Link here\n\nI keep a close eye on the weather forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology, both of them. There's one on the web and another for mobile phones. They don't often agree with each other, and of course they're both frequently wrong.\n\nToday, though, the mobile phone app excelled itself. We finally have rain, 6 mm over the last 24 hours. Or, as the app put it,\n\nPart of the app is a rainfall map showing precipitation. That showed that there was much more rain. How can that happen?\n\nWhatsApp: bug after bug? Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nI've been trying for a week now to set up video telephony on fossil, Yvonne's mobile phone. Somehow the “modern” approach to user interfaces shows itself at its worst here. But I had come to the conclusion that if I can work beyond WhatsApps bizarre interface, and explain it to Yvonne so that she doesn't have a panic attack every time she uses it, we might have something useful, especially since WhatsApp can communicate by an Internet link, which could be much cheaper.\n\nOK, try out on hirse first. It doesn't have a SIM card, so any communication has to go by the Internet. Migrate my main number to hirse. No problem. Make a call. Some message like “need to use the phone network”. Oh.\n\nTry calling in. The problem: hirse has the phone number associated with a SIM card in albo, which has a different WhatsApp number. Which does WhatsApp call? albo! Somehow there's more to this than meets the eye.\n\nWhen Yvonne got back from shopping, I changed her WhatsApp number to the number of second SIM on her phone. All sorts of things didn't work, and it couldn't call the number on hirse. hirse claimed that she wasn't registered, though I had set the “notify contacts” during the migration. In the end I moved the number back to the old one. And things still didn't work correctly! In particular, I could call the number, but WhatsApp didn't respond in any way, not even registering a missed call. Went through the settings and set tones for all notifications. Still no response. Restart the app. No response.\n\nNothing for it, the Microsoft solution: reboot. And yes, now it responds. Clearly some kind of bug. And it repeats the call tone for every notification, including messages. Oh, my bad. Get rid of the tone. Sorry, there's no provision for that. Select something at random, since it's too polite to play the tone when you're selecting it. I still get the ring tone for messages! I can't see any explanation except that it's another bug. It was getting late, so I turned off sounds to wait until tomorrow.\n\nAll this is made worse by the horrible user interface. So far I haven't found a way to display the associated phone number in the contact details. At one point I made the mistake of using the same name (mine) for both my phones, so there was no way at all to find out what “number” it had called.\n\nI hate WhatsApp! Topic: technology, general, opinion Link here\n\nMore fun with WhatsApp today. The first question, which decides whether it's even worthwhile: can I make a call over the Internet? Yesterday's experiments were overshadowed by other bugs. Today I tried making a call from fossil (Yvonne's phone) to hirse, the one without a SIM card. I have set it up with the main number of albo, so a normal call to that number should go to albo, and a WhatsApp call should go to hirse. Does it?\n\nYes! So yesterday's issues were probably due to other bugs.\n\nAnd the incorrect notification tones? Gone since the last reboot, Yvonne says. But later she changed her mind: once again the wrong tone when all notification tones were turned off.\n\nDammit, begone, WhatsApp! Removed it. Reinstalled it. And how about that, setup was almost completely without problem. She lost her image (“Avatar”, “The manifestation of a god in bodily form on earth” according to the OED). We can live with that. And somehow now everything Just Works—until the next unpleasant surprise.\n\nApart from that and the horrible user interface, established that you can change an audio call into a video call simply by pressing the button with the box with a loudspeaker on the right:\n\nInterestingly, it only works in one direction. To go in the other direction requires that the person at the other end do the same.\n\nVirtualBox again Topic: technology, photography, opinion Link here\n\nDxO PhotoLab 9 is out, and it looks worth trying. Time to reinstate one of my Microsoft virtual machines, which run under VirtualBox.\n\nI stopped using VirtualBox on hydra a year ago, though it was the main reason that I had so much memory (192 GB): I ran into network problems that I couldn't fix.\n\nNow FreeBSD has a port of VirtualBox 7. Time to try again? Tried first on dereel, with only 24 GB of memory. Where's my HOWTO? All fine, but it doesn't tell me how to add an existing VM. It must be in this diary somewhere, but where? I really should keep these HOWTOs up to date.\n\nStarting up the GUI was different from before, of course. And it wanted to set things up in the root file system. To go elsewhere I had to do this horrible tree walking. Finally I got to where I wanted (/src/VirtualBox/echuca). Tried to create a new VM. “Can't overwrite machine folder...\". What does that mean? They should know better than to call a directory a folder, but what's a “machine folder”? Lots of experimentation, continually being returned to the /root directory and having to climb my way out again. What does “help” say? Nothing. I wonder if the port forgot to install something important. After a while I discovered that it really wanted the parent directory /src/VirtualBox, but then I ran into other issues.\n\nAfter some time decided to create a new VM with the old virtual disk. Link? Yes, but VirtualBox detected the UUID and used the old name.\n\nYes, there are other possibilities. But I think that the best is to go through my diary and extract the information that I need to do things sanely. And maybe I should use the commands rather than the GUI, which seems to be getting more stupid as time goes on.\n\nWhatsApp an Avatar? Topic: technology, general, opinion Link here\n\nYesterday I established that an Avatar is a earthly manifestation of a Hindu god, but WhatsApp apparently wants to elevate Yvonne and me to deities. Until then, only initials appear to identify us on calls.\n\nOK, how do we do that? Settings, of course, “make your own avatar”, “Create from selfie”. OK. Take a suitably horrified photo of myself. Briefly it showed “There was an error with the avatar gen...”, so briefly that I didn't see it the first three times. What does that mean? Why can't it finish its sentences? So instead it presented me with a manual generation.\n\nWhy? What does the half message mean? It's repeatable on two different phones. And there seems to be no way to just add a normal photo. What a mess!\n\nVirtualBox progress Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nSo what's wrong with my VirtualBox installation? My current situation was exactly what I had a year ago: most VMs worked, but Microsoft VMs had networking problems. They could send data, but they didn't see the replies, so they hung in ARP. I attributed that to the version of VirtualBox (6.1.50 r161033), so I waited until version 7 came out. And then I discovered that I had exactly the same problem.\n\nThat didn't help just getting things running. After some searching, discovered that VirtualBox stores a configuration in the home directory, ~/.config/VirtualBox/ with a number of files, including log files that have no business there, but importantly VirtualBox.xml. OK, make a copy of that on dereel, and how about that, VirtualBox came up with all the VMs I knew.\n\nStart disaster, the only VM that would fit in dereel's memory.\n\nVT-x is disabled in the BIOS for all CPU modes (VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED).\n\n\n\nOh. There was something there, but can the twins help? Yes, specifically for a ThinkCentre:\n\nOnce in the BIOS, use the arrow keys to navigate to the Advanced tab. From the Advanced menu, select CPU Setup and press Enter. Look for an option labeled Intel(R) Virtualization Technology and select it. Using the arrow keys, change the setting from Disabled to Enabled.\n\nAfter that and rebooting, and with a change of network adapter name, it still didn't start. I got this message:\n\nX86_CPUID_AMD_FEATURE_EDX_AXMMX is not supported by the host but has already exposed to the guest [ver=19 pass=final] (VERR_SSM_LOAD_CPUID_MISMATCH).\n\nMore help from the twins. The saved state includes information from an AMD processor (hydra), but this is Intel. Discard saved state and start again.\n\nAfter that, and with a change of network adapter name, it started. I got this message, which I haven't seen before, but which seems harmless:\n\nerror: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is invalid or not set in the environment.\n\nThat variable isn't set on hydra either.\n\nWe're still not done. Trying to start an xterm from current gave me the message\n\nThe Virtual Machine reports that the guest OS does not support mouse pointer integration\n\nWhat's that? Gemini tells me:\n\nThe message \"The Virtual Machine reports that the guest OS does not support mouse pointer integration...\" in a FreeBSD virtual machine is common and means you need to install and configure the necessary guest additions for the mouse to work seamlessly. FreeBSD does not include these drivers out of the box, so you must install them yourself.\n\nThat sounds like the Ports Collection. But there is no additions package for VirtualBox 7.1, only for 6.50 and 5.2. Mañana.\n\nOn with disaster. So: ARP issue? While messing around on disaster, found the help message for ARP. It uses Unix-style option delimiters, and -s sets a permanent MAC address. OK, if this is an ARP issue, we can fix that:\n\nOh: Microsoft has a different format for MAC addresses. Try again:\n\nAnd that as Administrator . Time to ask the twins.\n\nQ: What does \"The ARP entry addition failed: Access is denied\" when running CMD as administrator under \"windows\" 10? A: The \"ARP entry addition failed: Access is denied\" error in Windows 10, even when running Command Prompt as an administrator, typically happens when trying to add a static Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entry for a reason other than a permission issue.\n\nInteresting. “Access is denied” is not a permission issue? Something's wrong here, either Gemini or Microsoft. My money is on Microsoft.\n\nAnd that's what Gemini suggests too:\n\nUse netsh instead: In some cases, especially on newer versions of Windows, the arp command may have issues with Access is denied errors even when the user has administrator privileges.\n\nSo I ended up with this simple invocation:\n\nAnd how about that, it worked. Well, at least it put the address in the ARP table, and I was able to ping out, so disaster knew the address. But it still didn't hear any reply.\n\nYet another question to Gemini:\n\nWhat could cause a Microsoft guest under VirtualBox to send network data but not receive it, when other guests have no problem with the same configuration?\n\nThe obvious answer: firewall. Check to be on the safe side. No, no firewall enabled. How about an Ethernet adapter issue?\n\nIf you are using an Intel PRO/1000, try switching to a different type, such as the AMD PCnet-FAST III.\n\nOK, try that. No improvement. Next idea: this video\n\nOK, try anything once. Follow the instructions step by step, none of which showed any obvious issues. Change the interface back to (specifically) Intel PRO/1000 MT Deskop (8254EM). Not much hope there: that's what I had.\n\nBut it worked! My final configuration looks identical to the start configuration. What changed? There's something lurking under the surface that I don't understand. Can I now get it to run on hydra?\n\nMore VirtualBox pain Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nYesterday I finally got networking working using VirtualBox 7.1 and Microsoft “Windows” 10. Time to refine a few things. First, start the windows on hydra:0.0, a 1920×1080 display, rather than on hydra:0.1, which has 3840×2160, giving windows that are too small.\n\nBut it didn't work! I could start on hydra:0.1, but on hydra:0.0 nothing happened. Is there some kind of built-in memory in the configuration file?\n\nSo, time to upgrade current.lemis.com, another VM running FreeBSD-CURRENT. It was a year out of date.\n\nStart a make buildworld , not for the first time. But nothing happened!\n\nFurther investigation showed that I had a network hang. And disaster was also hanging! Shut down disaster and current regained network access—for a while. Then it hung again.\n\nThis seems worse than my experience on hydra with VirtualBox 6.5. Tried it there and it worked.\n\nWhat a pain! What does Google Gemini say?\n\nQ: Are there known networking issues with VirtualBox under FreeBSD? A: Yes, there are known networking issues and quirks with VirtualBox when used as a host on a FreeBSD system. While VirtualBox works, it is not an officially \"supported\" host platform by Oracle, which means users often have to rely on the community and package maintainers to troubleshoot and resolve issues. (much irrelevant information omitted) Users sometimes experience slow network speeds, particularly with upload speeds, when using bridged adapters. This can be more pronounced on specific emulated network card types. While VirtualBox can function as a host on FreeBSD, it is not a \"fire-and-forget\" solution... If you encounter speed or reliability issues, experimenting with different emulated network adapter types can often resolve the problem.\n\nThat's not encouraging, though it doesn't directly relate to my problems. But what else can it be? Two different versions of FreeBSD, two different machines, two different versions of VirtualBox. Does it work better on Linux? That would be a real let-down, but possibly I should try it. How much pain would that be?\n\nTesting RSS feeds Topic: technology Link here\n\nI write all my web markup myself, with the aid of a number of PHP scripts. The result is that the RSS feed looks nothing much like my sources. So when something goes wrong with the markup, it's hard to find where, not helped by things like the W3.org validator, which typically points to where the error is detected, not where it occurred, and which at the moment caches input, so even after fixing the problem it reports the old problem.\n\nCallum Gibson is the main user of RSS feeds whom I know of. He pointed me to this validator. It also points to where the error was found, but at least I can try things and repeat them. That fixed an issue I had with earlier this month, where the error was over 100 lines from where it was detected.\n\nChasing the VirtualBox bug Topic: technology Link here\n\nSo why was VirtualBox version 7.1 on dereel even worse than version 6.50 on hydra? One possibility might be that the VMs themselves were NFS mounted. OK, find a 1 TB disk and copy them there. Put it in in place of the DVD drive, and was amazed to find that it came up as /dev/ada0, relegating the system disk to /dev/ada1 and requiring manual intervention (/etc/fstab) to continue. How could that happen?\n\nThen copying the VMs from hydra. That took a few hours, of course, so I'll continue tomorrow.\n\nWhile looking for the disks also found one marked “MS “Windows” 10 disgust”, dated 10.XII.2020. Comparing with my diary, that proves to be the disk that came with the machine I'm working on. So I should be able to just put it in and run it. That's the next thing to do if I still can't get VirtualBox to run reliably.\n\nDxO PhotoLab 9: worth the trouble? Topic: photography, technology, opinion Link here\n\nI've spent a lot of time looking at the new features of DxO PhotoLab 9. Even better noise reduction, of course, but the big new thing is what appears to be excellent object recognition (“masking”). But that's only part of the story. Can I remove objects? Replace them with something else? It seems that the answer is “no”.\n\nSomewhere I also thought I saw a way to merge HDR images, but that seems to be a misunderstanding. Instead they have improved file handling, including collapsing related image groups and automatic file naming. None of them seem to be anywhere near as flexible as the method I worked out 13 years ago, so it's of no use to me.\n\nSo: what will the future bring? The masking is good, but is it enough to spend US $240 on? There's a very good chance that they'll come up with a version 10 in the not-too-distant future and want $120 for an upgrade. Maybe I should just wait.\n\nVicRoads: still in the 20th century Topic: general, technology, opinion Link here\n\nAfter scrapping my Hyundai Elantra at the end of July I was due a refund for the registration.\n\nAnd they sent me a cheque! I thought they went out of fashion well over a year ago. And yes, the bank refused to accept it.\n\nBut why? I really don't understand. They should have transferred it to my bank account, like any sane company. But no, I had to call their customer service line (1300 555 165, which looks suspiciously like a fake US phone number) and go through their silly authentication process (including a form of 2FA, sending a PIN to my phone. That would have helped a lot if I had been calling from that phone). But yes, relatively quickly they took the details and told me that the transfer would occur in the next 2 to 3 weeks. Receipt number HD1155831.\n\n2 to 3 weeks? Why? Ah, we need human intervention. Why? Nowadays we have computers. With only marginally good programming the money could have been in my bank account before the end of the call. But clearly they don't have that.\n\nMore VirtualBox insights Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nSo what's wrong with VirtualBox networking? Google Gemini had suggested that it might depend on the emulated network adapter, so spent some time trying different adapters, with no improvement. About the only thing that was clear was the ping time: from guest to host the expected 0.15 ms, but in the other direction much longer, and with wildly different times:\n\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 29.752/61.679/175.892/36.953 ms\n\nGave that up and looked at some bug reports, which showed surprisingly few network issues. But one, by Ivan Rozhuk, was interesting:\n\nTry to disable HW offloads on NIC:\n\nifconfig igb0 -rxcsum -txcsum -vlanhwtso -lro -tso4 -tso6 down up\n\n\n\nAnd how about that, that worked. So why is this not better known? There's also a wiki with surprisingly little of use.\n\nLater I discovered that my guest current.lemis.com had 8 CPUs, while the host dereel only has four. That's quite impressive that it worked at all. Reducing the number of CPUs on current got rid of the slow ping times.\n\nSo: are we done? I don't think so. I still need to find whether the Microsoft guests work reliably.\n\nBruce Evans' C compiler Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nMail in the TUHS mailing list today:\n\nSubject: [TUHS] Bruce Evans 386 Minix patches & compiler source\n\n\n\nIt's been quite a while since I was messing with Minix386 back in the days\n\nwhen Bruce Evans released a set of patches to bring 386 support.\n\nI'm pretty sure over on oldlinux.org the patch set exists, but I can only\n\nfind the one set of binaries of his 386 toolchain.\n\nI know it eventually evolved into the bin86 toolchain that Linus would go on\n\nto use to create real mode boot code, but I don't know if any of the source\n\ncode to his 1991/1992 386 toolchain ever got published?\n\n\n\nIs it somewhere on the disk images that Peter Jeremy saved? I haven't looked at them for over three years, and I only had the smaller ones that I could download. Sent off a message to the other people who have access, Warren Toomey (who also coincidentally runs TUHS) and Warner Losh, and only got a brief response from the first.\n\nBack to look at what I have: three files, /src/bde/ad1.img, /src/bde/ad2.img and /src/bde/ad3.img. I had only looked at /ad0.img, requiring gnop to access the individual partitions. There was a good reason: I had renamed ad2.img.xz to ad2.img without uncompressing it. Did that now and ended up with 60 GB of data.\n\nAnd the contents?\n\n=== root@dereel (/dev/pts/1) /bde 13 -> mdconfig -a -t vnode -f /src/bde/besplex/ad2.img\n\nmd0\n\n=== root@dereel (/dev/pts/1) /bde 14 -> l /dev/md0\n\nmd0 md0s1 md0s2 md0s2a md0s2b md0s2d md0s2e md0s2f md0s2g md0s2h\n\n\n\nAll the BSD partitions there!

That was much easier than I thought. Is it correct? That would be too easy.\n\nMore fun with VirtualBox and bde Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nMore playing around with VirtualBox today, with no breakthrough. I had paused dereel with zzz, and when I restarted it the networking had gone to hell again. Here a repeat of what I had done yesterday:\n\n=== root@dereel (/dev/pts/3) /eureka/home/grog 1 -> ifconfig\n\nem0: flags=1008943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST,LOWER_UP> metric 0 mtu 1500 options=4e524bb<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,JUMBO_MTU,VLAN_HWCSUM,LRO,WOL_MAGIC,VLAN_HWFILTER,VLAN_HWTSO,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6,HWSTATS,MEXTPG>\n\n=== root@dereel (/dev/pts/3) /eureka/home/grog 2 -> ifconfig em0 -rxcsum -txcsum -vlanhwtso -lro -tso4 -tso6 down up\n\n=== root@dereel (/dev/pts/3) /eureka/home/grog 3 -> ifconfig\n\nem0: flags=1008943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST,LOWER_UP> metric 0 mtu 1500\n\noptions=4c120b8<VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,JUMBO_MTU,VLAN_HWCSUM,WOL_MAGIC,VLAN_HWFILTER,TXCSUM_IPV6,HWSTATS,MEXTPG>\n\n\n\nAfter that it worked normally again, but the Microsoft boxen still didn't want to know. Do I have to cold start them every time?\n\nAnd Bruce Evans' C compiler? I posted what I had and got no answer. I'm not convinced that I have the right files, though the name usr/src/mx386/bcc (from the archive e/bde/dist/minix.tar.gz) does raise some hope.\n\nPower fail! Topic: general, technology, opinion Link here\n\nAt 11:04, while preparing breakfast, we had a grid power failure. Not a problem: we have a PV system. But the power dropped totally! Almost before we knew it, it was back again. The inverter log shows less than a minute.\n\nThat's not the first time. It happens far too often, most recently two months ago. And today, as then, my main machines eureka and hydra lost power, because I still hadn't got round to getting a UPS installed. Today I made up for that: I have a ten-year-old 1000 VA 650 W UPS just lying around. It is still functional? In contrast to the CyberPower UPS that I bought 2½ years ago, it seems still to work. While the power was down, took the opportunity to tidy up the mess to the left of my desk top, removing this display card from eureka and making a cut in my fingertip in the process:\n\nThat once drove three of the four monitors then connected to eureka, but that was years ago, as the dust suggests.\n\nWhat caused the outage? Hard to say. The inverter logs show no sign of overvoltage before the outage, though afterwards the voltage hung over 250 V for over an hour. I suppose it's time to brave the potential issues and update the firmware.\n\nPowercor had a different view. An hour later I received a message:\n\nAnd then\n\nOn checking, I found that I also had similar messages from the day before, where there was no outage at all. Still, rather phantom outages than real ones.\n\nhydra upgrade Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nI've had hydra for nearly 2 years, and I still haven't got round to configuring it quite the way I want; much is in the X menus. But of course the system is now down-rev. What better time then after a power failure to bring it up to date?\n\nMy real concern after an update is that the ports will no longer work the way I want. Building a new world is relatively simple, and it took just shy of 1000 seconds to build the world and new kernel. And rebooting went relatively smoothly, though it no longer found the Ethernet card on the motherboard. I had suspected issues in that area (it's a 2.5 Gb/s Realtek card) and installed a second, which showed up as re0 , so all I needed to do was to change where I plugged in the network cable.\n\nAs I feared, the ports were a different matter. They were worse then ever before, taking 3 iterations to delete 100—no, 101—no, 103 ports, including chromium curl, emacs of course, enblend, exiv2, feh, ffmpeg, firefox, fusefs-curlftpfs, gdb, git, gnupg, groff, hugin, mplayer, mpv, mutt, rdesktop, rsync, rtorrent, vigra, virtualbox-ose, xpdf and xv. And even then I missed ImageMagick, which further annoys me with a change of name. Yes, convert is a subcommand of ImageMagic, but now they have decided that the name is too invasive, so I'll have to change all invocations to magick convert. I suppose that one's fair enough.\n\nAnd firefox has new messages, which it spews by the hundred where it presumably suspects nobody is looking, on the home terminal:\n\nconsole.warn: services.settings: Could not determine network status. Message: TypeError: can't access prop \"isLinkUp\", lazy.gNetworkLinkService is undefined\n\nGradually the issues became clear: I can no longer connect to eureka with ssh, nor at all to hydra. I was expecting issues with eureka, but not with hydra. Was it because it came up before the network was ready? I had to restart syslogd to get it to write to eureka, and to change the permissions on wake for normal users to use it.\n\nWhat am I left with? I can no longer use erc, the Emacs IRC command:\n\nerc: missing symbol (.at)\n\n⛔ Warning (erc): Required module ‘networks’ not loaded. If this was unexpected, please add it to ‘erc-modules’.⛔ Warning (erc): Required module ‘networks’ not loaded. If this was unexpected, please add it to ‘erc-modules’.\n\n\n\nWhat does that mean? I'll find out some time. Fortunately it still works on eureka, so there's no hurry.\n\nAnd independently of all that I need to pay more attention to my X configuration. I still don't get my mice set up correctly at startup. But that's fun for another day.\n\nCompleting the upgrade Topic: technology, general, photography, opinion Link here\n\nInto the office this morning as usual. No mail from hydra. What happened there? /var/log/maillog showed a number of:\n\nSep 20 03:03:54 hydra postfix/cleanup[70392]: B1BC41AB5: message-id=<202509191703.58JH3sRP070451@hydra.lemis.com>\n\nSep 20 03:03:54 hydra sendmail[70451]: 58JH3sRP070451: to=root, ctladdr=root (0/0), delay=00:00:00, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=relay, pri=33687, relay=[127.0.0.1] [127.0.0.1], dsn=2.0.0, stat=Sent (Ok: queued as B1BC41AB5)\n\nSep 20 03:03:54 hydra postfix/qmgr[1845]: B1BC41AB5: from=<root@hydra.lemis.com>, size=4303, nrcpt=1 (queue active)\n\nSep 20 03:03:54 hydra postfix/local[70440]: warning: unexpected attribute smtputf8 from local socket (expecting: sendopts)\n\nSep 20 03:03:54 hydra postfix/smtpd[70368]: disconnect from localhost[127.0.0.1] ehlo=1 mail=1 rcpt=1 data=1 quit=1 commands=5\n\nSep 20 03:03:54 hydra postfix/local[70440]: warning: deliver_request_get: error receiving common attributes\n\n\n\nWhat's smtputf8 ? Checking /usr/local/etc/postfix/ showed that a number of files, which should have been symlinks to the same directory on eureka, were missing. Forgot to mount a NFS file system. After mounting and restarting postfix, all was well. But what does the strange message mean? It seems that it's a default.\n\nAnd then there was Hugin. I had expected some issues, but not what I got: when I tried to start the “fast panorama preview” I got\n\nerror installing GLEW\n\nFast preview window can not be opened\n\nWhat does that mean? I have a package installed, which pkg reports as\n\nglew-2.2.0_3 OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library\n\nAnd there doesn't seem to be anything else that was there before. But when I retried the attempt, it worked. Where is the bug? Hugin or FreeBSD? In addition, irritatingly it resized the windows on every start. I thought I had got rid of that with some script magic, but it seems to be gone.\n\nAnd then there's the mouse. That's simple enough: instead of searching for the index for the mouse, it's easy enough to write\n\nxinput set-button-map \"Telink 2.4G Mouse\" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 2 10\n\nOne of the messages I received was completely misleading:\n\n=== grog@hydra (/dev/pts/16) ~/Photos/20250920 47 -> (EE) event4 - Telink 2.4G Mouse, class 0/0, rev 1.10/1.00, addr 4: client bug: event processing lagging behind by 32ms, your system is too slow\n\n(EE) client bug: timer event4 debounce: scheduled expiry is in the past (-48ms), your system is too slow\n\n(EE) client bug: timer event4 debounce short: scheduled expiry is in the past (-61ms), your system is too slow\n\n\n\nThat's not hydra at all, despite the prompt. I started X on teevee from hydra, and this appears to be its way of saying “the cat got on my mouse”.\n\nAccessing systems with ssh from eureka Topic: technology Link here\n\neureka is now running a nearly 10 year old system, but I don't want to update it: it works.\n\nBut some issues remain. One was that I couldn't automatically log on with ssh: I had to enter a password, which is irritating in scripts. Once again Google Gemini to my aid. Add this to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\n\nPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa,rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256\n\nNow I just need to see why I can't access eureka from hydra without a password.\n\nFinally the birding photos Topic: photography, animals, technology, opinion Link here\n\nIt's been 4 days since the latest OM System birding “workshop”, and I've only just got round to processing the best photos. Are these the best?\n\nIt's a lot of work making up my mind out of over 250 photos. Yvonne did it for me, and those were the ones she liked.\n\nMore ssh strangeness Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nI've already established issues with ssh sessions from hydra to eureka, but not from other systems. Once again Google Gemini to my aid, this time less useful. It tells me to allow ssh-rsa in /etc/ssh/sshd_config by adding this line:\n\nPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa\n\nWe've seen that before on the other side. But that's a non-starter: sshd doesn't want to know:\n\n=== root@eureka (/dev/pts/1) /etc/ssh 28 -> service sshd restart\n\nPerforming sanity check on sshd configuration.\n\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config: line 54: Bad configuration option: PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes\n\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config: terminating, 1 bad configuration options\n\nOK, what about the alternative of using a key?\n\n=== root@eureka (/dev/pts/1) /etc/ssh 32 -> service sshd restart; date\n\nPerforming sanity check on sshd configuration.\n\nCould not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\n\nStopping sshd.\n\nWaiting for PIDS: 22656.\n\nPerforming sanity check on sshd configuration.\n\nCould not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\n\nStarting sshd.\n\nCould not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\n\n\n\nWhy? It doesn't seem to affect other key forms. And comparing hydra and tiwi gives me on hydra:\n\ndebug1: Offering public key: /home/grog/.ssh/id_rsa RSA SHA256:S7sZHLcY4dgw53/rF70vrScdPuGef3enHdJzuYA1WDo agent\n\ndebug1: send_pubkey_test: no mutual signature algorithm\n\n\n\nBut on tiwi it works as expected:\n\ndebug1: Offering public key: /home/grog/.ssh/id_rsa RSA SHA256:S7sZHLcY4dgw53/rF70vrScdPuGef3enHdJzuYA1WDo agent\n\ndebug1: Server accepts key: /home/grog/.ssh/id_rsa RSA SHA256:S7sZHLcY4dgw53/rF70vrScdPuGef3enHdJzuYA1WDo agent\n\nAuthenticated to eureka.lemis.com ([192.109.197.137]:22) using \"publickey\".\n\n\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nMutt problems Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nFirst thing I do in the morning is to read the overnight mail, typically a couple of hundred messages. But this morning I tried to delete the messages I had read, I received the message “unable to write mailbox” or something similar. Why? Normally I see a message like that when I'm out of disk space, but this wasn't the case. Return, painfully delete the messages again, and it worked. Is that an NFS issue? It has happened before. Was that also overnight? I'll have to look more carefully next time.\n\nMore ssh pain Topic: technology, general, opinion Link here\n\nInto the office this morning to find eureka maxed out with at least 35 ssh-add processes, all looping at 100% CPU time.\n\nWhy? This is not a new program:\n\n3054180 -r-xr-xr-x 1 root wheel 17576 25 Nov 2015 /usr/bin/ssh-add\n\nOnce again Google Gemini to my aid, coming with the suggestion that it could be that ssh-add was running already, and that I should put in code like\n\nssh-add -l >/dev/null || ssh-add\n\nThat worked up to a point, but it doesn't explain why it is only happening now, after nearly 10 years. It's much more likely that it's related to the playing around I have been doing lately, though it didn't affect ssh-add, and I had backed out the changes anyway. And in the course of the day I found another instance in my weather software, but that found further breakage: the external view of my weather stopped in early June when I got the new weather station. More to fix when the current problems are over.\n\nssh-add: A clue Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nI haven't done much to investigate the ssh-add problem for the moment. It seems that I call ssh-add in a number of places, all of which need fixing. But while playing around I found:\n\n=== grog@eureka (/dev/pts/3) ~/public_html 32 -> ssh-add < /dev/null\n\nEnter passphrase for /home/grog/.ssh/id_rsa:\n\nCould it be that the looping is the incorrect handling of a prompt? It doesn't help much in fixing it, but it could help understand.\n\nThe advantages of upgrades Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nAs expected, upgrading hydra caused a number of problems, most of which I have described. And this time it was Chromium, which has forgotten all its editing keys, or at least the ones I want. More searching required.\n\nOn the other hand, one bug has gone away: xv can now display PNG again. Not exactly a big improvement, but at least a fixed bug.\n\nThe daily Android bug Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nSomehow the Android operating system seems to be the least reliable I know. I'm gradually coming to terms with it, but today there was another one: trying to download files to a Real Computer, albo didn't respond, though it claimed to be working. Disable Wi-Fi, reeenable, and it worked. No change of connection.\n\nWhat a mess Android is!\n\nAnother web server overload Topic: technology, opinion Link here\n\nIt's been well over 4 months since I set up a new external web server, fra.lemis.com, to address the really heavy load, with load averages up to 170. And so, of course, it dropped back to under 1.\n\nBut now it's increasing again, both servers now well over 200. Why? I had thought it was related to the imagesizes parameter, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Let's see how long the overload lasts this time.\n\nFast postal service Topic: general, technology, opinion Link here\n\nI've bought a couple of cameras in the United Kingdom. The usual tracking information, with a twist:\n\nIt's in Leeds, but it'll be here tomorrow! Now that's a lot faster than Australia Post. Or just plain stupid.\n\nYour cameras have been delivered! Topic: technology, photography, general, opinion Link here\n\nYesterday's claim of fast delivery was amusing enough, but they haven't given up:\n\nThey have been delivered! How did we do?\n\nI'm amazed. Clearly the cameras are still in the United Kingdom. My best guess is that Royal Mail have delivered the cameras to the people who are currently in the process of sending them half way round the world, or at least they have received documentation from them. So from their limited viewpoint they have been delivered. No concept of them only having travelled a fraction of the distance.\n\nWeb server load: dropping Topic: technology Link here\n\nYesterday's web server overload didn't last long. It's back to round 1 again. I suppose that's what we're going to have to live with for the foreseeable future. It's interesting that even at this extreme overload people claimed that response was satisfactory. That's significantly different from last time, where some sites got timeouts.\n\nArtificially intelligent breakfast Topic: food and drink, technology, opinion Link here\n\nFor some reason we bought a quarter cabbage recently. I forget why, but it was intended for breakfast. All right, Google Gemini, give me some east asian recipes with fried cabbage.\n\nAnd the twins obliged: 手撕包菜 - Shǒu Sī Bāo Cài, “hand shredded cabbage\", which didn't look too bad, modulo these horrible cups measurements. I can't even blame the twins for that: so many recipes use it. But it's the biggest hindrance I can find for trying out recipes. OK, Gemini, give me a Chinese recipe with fried cabbage and noodles using metric units. OK, how about 包菜炒粉/麵, which Google Translate translates as “cabbage fried rice noodles”? A completely different recipe! The best I can guess from the two recipes is that 4 cups of cabbage weigh about 300 g.\n\nSpent some time—probably more than cooking—writing a sane version of the second recipe.\n\nSoftware upgrades: the sting in the tail Topic: technology, photography, opinion Link here\n\nHouse photos again today, the second time since I upgraded hydra to FreeBSD 14.3 last week. And once again I had pain.\n\nFirstly, creating HDR didn't work well. It took me a while to discover that it was an unrelated bug in one of my scripts: I managed to mix images from the OM System OM-1 Mark II with the correct images from the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II. I had already expected problems like that, and /Photos/Tools/housephtos.awk contained appropriate comments. Here the fix:\n\n-# $Id: diary-sep2025.php,v 1.35 2025/10/01 05:22:39 grog Exp $\n\n+# $Id: diary-sep2025.php,v 1.35 2025/10/01 05:22:39 grog Exp $\n\n# Create a makejpeg file from housephoto.notes file.\n\nBEGIN {\n\ni = 0;\n\n-# XXX Only look at photos from E-M1 Mark II.\n\n+# Only look at photos from E-M1 Mark II.\n\n# Is this safe?\n\n-# Was: 4*.ORF, E-M1 /2 only\n\n- while (\"ls -rt *.ORF | sed 's:embedded\\.::; s:\\.JPG::; s:\\.jpg::; s:\\.ORF::'\" | getline > 0)\n\n+# It's better than the alternative.\n\n+ while (\"ls -rt 4*.ORF | sed 's:embedded\\.::; s:\\.JPG::; s:\\.jpg::; s:\\.ORF::'\" | getline > 0)\n\n\n\nThe problem was that I didn't limit the choice to photos from the E-M1 Mark II. Not an upgrade problem at all.\n\nThe other, though, seems to be related to the upgrade of Hugin, now version 2024.0.1. The screens appear in the wrong place and at the wrong (tiny) size, and the directories are wrong. That's almost certainly related to the scripts that I wrote over 16 years ago which frob the ~/.hugin file to get rid of this horrible directory name retention. But that's all they do, and somehow it doesn't seem to work. A small detail, but irritating. Will I get round to it by next week?\n\nRevisiting old photos Topic: photography, technology, opinion Link here\n\nLooking back through old photos, found some of my first panoramas:\n\nIt dates from 11 April 2009 with the Olympus E-510, so old that I don't even have Exif data for it. I had already attempted to improve it 8 years later:\n\nBut that was still with the Ashampoo Photo Optimizer, which I have stopped using. Another attempt with “Perfectly Clear” gave me further improvements. Here are the three together (run the cursor over an image to compare it with its neighbour):\n\nIn particular the highlights and shadows are greatly improved.\n\nfra rebooted! Topic: technology, general, opinion Link here\n\nThe vultures have rebooted fra! Yes, they warned they would do so because of some unspecific bug in Linux, so they rebooted my FreeBSD box as well. The good news is that it came back without any intervention on my part, but of course the up time has gone to hell.\n\nAnother bloody power fail Topic: technology, general, opinion Link here\n\nIn the evening, another grid power failure. And another directly behind it. Both were sub-second, but once again eureka and hydra failed. So much for the UPS.\n\nWhy? Yes, it's an old UPS, but it claims to have plenty of charge, and the failures were so short that most clocks in the kitchen kept going. Can it be that it was a power surge, and that this UPS didn't handle it? The UPSs for lagune, teevee and tiwi had no problems.\n\nAnd the fallout? I got things running relatively quickly, but firefox didn't recover its many tabs. I had to start a different profile to get anything. And of course X on teevee failed, because I had started it from hydra.\n\nSo what do I do now? Buy more of UPSs of the kind that power the other machines?\n\nTuesday, 30 September 2025 Dereel Top of page previous day\n\nMore firefox pain Topic: technology, general, opinion Link here\n\nSo what's wrong with firefox? My standard profile just hangs. Why? How do I debug such a mess?\n\nI tried setting up a different profile, losing a number of tabs in the process, but nothing I could do could get the font sizes right. Get them right for my diary (without any trickery) and they're far too small for things like Wikipedia and friends. Migrate from hydra:0.2 (3840×2160) to hydra:0.0 (1920×1080)? Yes, that works, but why did it happen?\n\nThen it occured to me: yes, the standard profile still hangs. But I can check the settings. And it seems that the big thing is the Zoom setting, which was at 150%. After setting that, things were OK. But why the difference between my diary and Wikipedia and Co.? And why are font sizes such an issue with firefox?",

      "headline": "VMScape and why Xen dodged it",
      "content": "ETH Zürich’s new VMScape attack hit KVM and VMware, but Xen’s microkernel-like design kept it out of reach.\n\nIt’s been less than two weeks since the security team at ETH Zürich published their research on a new microarchitectural attack they call VMScape:\n\nIt’s a neat piece of work, and it shows once again how CPUs, with all their clever tricks for performance, can sometimes open the door to data leaks across virtual machines.\n\nWhat is VMScape?\n\nThe short version: modern CPUs use a branch predictor to guess where code will go next. It makes things faster, but the predictor also “remembers” past patterns. If you can manipulate that memory, you can mislead the CPU and peek at things you shouldn’t. That’s the basic idea behind Spectre-style attacks.\n\nAccording to the ETH team:\n\n“We find that branch predictor state is not fully flushed across VMs, enabling cross-VM Branch Target Injection (vBTI) primitives. We demonstrate the practical impact of vBTI with VMScape, a cross-VM attack capable of leaking QEMU userspace secrets from a malicious guest VM on AMD Zen 4 and Zen 5 CPUs.”\n\nIn other words, a malicious VM can target the hypervisor’s userspace components and start leaking data. For KVM, that means QEMU, which is heavily exposed. VMware is in the same situation.\n\nWhy Xen wasn’t affected\n\nThe researchers also note that Xen is not vulnerable. That’s not because Xen has no bugs (it does, like every hypervisor), but because of its architecture.\n\nFrom day one, Xen was designed to keep the hypervisor core small and move everything else out. Device emulation, storage drivers, network stacks — they all live in Dom0, which is itself just another virtual machine. Dom0 has more privileges than a normal guest, but it’s still not the hypervisor.\n\nThat architectural choice makes Xen closer to a microkernel than a traditional monolithic hypervisor. The core stays minimal, with a narrow set of responsibilities, and anything that doesn’t absolutely need to run at the highest privilege level gets pushed out. That’s not just elegant — it’s a big deal for security.\n\nSize matters (in a good way)\n\nBecause the hypervisor itself is small, it’s easier to audit, reason about, and even certify. That’s why you’ll find Xen at the heart of a lot of embedded and safety-critical projects, where formal verification and certification are required. Try doing that with a massive, monolithic kernel and you’ll quickly run into a wall. With Xen, it’s actually feasible (and being done as we speak).\n\nVMScape highlights the benefits of that design: QEMU is simply not sitting next to the hypervisor. Even if you leak information from it, you’re still only talking about a process in Dom0, not the privileged heart of the system.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nArchitectural choices made twenty years ago are paying off today. By separating responsibilities, Xen reduced its attack surface and avoided a whole class of problems. That doesn’t make it invincible (Xen has had and will have its share of vulnerabilities) but it does mean that by design, certain attacks don’t land as hard.\n\nAs the ETH Zürich team points out, mitigations for KVM involve adding new predictor flushes, which Linux developers have already started to implement. VMware will need similar patches. Xen doesn’t need those same emergency measures, because the architecture already put a buffer in place.\n\nDefense in depth\n\nIt’s tempting to say “Xen wins” and stop there. But that’s not the whole story. Security is never just about one design decision. CPUs will keep evolving, new side channels will keep appearing, and no hypervisor can afford to be complacent.\n\nStill, VMScape is a good reminder that defense in depth starts at the architecture level. A small, microkernel-like core, privilege separation, isolation of device emulation — all of that adds resilience. It won’t stop every possible attack, but it does add another layer of safety, and in security, layers are what make the difference.",

      "content": "Description: ParkControl is Pro Windows app to adjust CPU core parking and heterogenous processor scheduling settings.\n\nPro Benefits\n\nBitsum Dynamic Boost\n\nAutomatically switch power plans when your PC enters and leaves the idle state\n\nPower Plan change Notifications\n\nNotifications of when and what process changed your active power plan (image)\n\nSupport Bitsum’s Independent Innovation\n\nYour support enables us to create new tools, and maintain our existing ones!\n\nIntroduction to CPU Core Parking\n\nCPU Parking is a low-power sleep state (C6) supported by most modern processors and operating systems. It dynamically disables CPU cores in an effort to conserve power when idle. Unfortunately, this power saving comes at a price: Latency when CPUs need unparked to execute code.\n\nInitially, core parking was controlled entirely by the operating system. The aggressive core parking of Windows led to a great deal of inefficiency during bursting CPU loads. Intel moved core parking control onto the chip in the Skylake generation, and AMD followed, but still the parameters of the Windows power plans are set to aggressively park CPU cores. Even the default ‘High Performance’ power plan is not immune. The new ‘Ultra Performance’ power plan copies what Bitsum did with our own ‘Bitsum Highest Performance’ power plan and finally disables core parking entirely.\n\nParkControl (and Process Lasso) not only let one more easily configure CPU core parking and frequency scaling, but also allow for dynamic entrance into a higher performance power plan. For instance, with Process Lasso, you can automatically enter ‘Bitsum Highest Performance’ will you start a game, then go back to ‘Balanced’ when you exit.\n\nParkControl has Dynamic Boost to allow you to set active and idle power plans. Process Lasso has a similar feature with its IdleSaver.\n\nEfficacy of Disabling Core Parking\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that disabling CPU core parking can make a tangible improvement in system performance. There are many factors that will determine precisely how effective it will be for a given situation. However, generally, Windows is too aggressive in its core parking, resulting in high latency during bursting CPU loads, stemming from the overhead of having to unpark CPU cores. Since bursting CPU loads are the most common type for many workloads, core parking can be a substantial drag on system performance and responsiveness.\n\nUsing ParkControl\n\nParkControl lets you easily set CPU core parking and frequency scaling parameters for both AC (plugged-in) and DC (battery) power states of your device.\n\nBoth CPU core parking and frequency scaling are power saving features of modern CPUs. CPU core parking is when cores are put into a sleep-like state when demand is low. Similarly, CPU frequency scaling allows the CPU base frequency to be lowered, again to conserve energy.\n\nEach power plan has its own settings, and can be selected via the power plan drop-down. When you select a power plan, the user interface will populate with that power plan’s settings. After making changes, click the ‘Apply’ button to save them. Use the ‘Make active’ button to switch the PC to that power plan.\n\nRelease Name: Bitsum ParkControl Pro 5.5.0.8\n\nSize: 3.6 MB\n\nLinks: HOMEPAGE – NFO – Torrent Search\n\nDownload: RAPiDGATOR",

      "headline": "Meta’s Infrastructure Evolution and the Advent of AI",
      "content": "Over the past 21 years, Meta has grown exponentially from a small social network connecting a few thousand people in a handful of universities in the U.S. into several apps and novel hardware products that serve over 3.4 billion people throughout the world.\n\nOur infrastructure has evolved significantly over the years, growing from a handful of software systems on a small fleet of servers in a few co-location facilities to a massive, globally networked operation. We faced numerous challenges along the way and developed innovative solutions to overcome them.\n\nThe advent of AI has changed all of our assumptions on how to scale our infrastructure. Building infrastructure for AI requires innovation at every layer of the stack, from hardware and software, to our networks, to our data centers themselves.\n\nFacebook was built on the open source Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PhP (LAMP) stack. True to our roots, much of our work has been openly shared with the engineering community in the form of research papers or open source hardware and software systems. We remain committed to this open source vision and describe how we are committed to an open standards approach to silicon and hardware systems as we push the frontiers of computer science.\n\nScaling Our Infrastructure Stack (2004 – 2010)\n\nIn our earliest years, we focused our engineering work on scaling our software stack. As Facebook expanded from Harvard to other universities, each university got its own database. Students logging on to Facebook would connect to a set of common web servers that would in turn connect each student to their university’s database. We quickly realized that students wished to connect with their friends who attended other universities — this was the birth of our social graph that interconnected everyone on the social network.\n\nAs Facebook expanded beyond universities to high schools and then the general public, there was a dramatic increase in the number of people on our platform. We managed database load by scaling our Memcache deployments and then building entirely new software systems such as the TAO social graph, and a whole host of new caching and data management systems. We also developed a new ranking service for News Feed and a photo service for sharing photos and videos.\n\nSoon, we were expanding beyond the US to Europe. Scaling our software systems was critical, but no longer sufficient. We needed to find other ways to scale. So we moved one layer below software and started scaling our physical infrastructure. We expanded beyond small co-location facilities in the Bay Area to a co-lo in Ashburn, Va. In parallel, we built out our first data centers in Prineville, Ore. and Forest City, N.C.\n\nAs our physical infrastructure scaled to multiple data centers, we ran into two new problems. First, we needed to connect our user base distributed across the US and Europe to our data centers. We tackled this problem by aggressively building out our edge infrastructure where we obtained some compute capacity beside every local internet service provider (ISP) and bought into the peering network that connected the ISP to our data centers. Second, we needed to replicate our entire software stack to each data center so that people would have the same experience irrespective of which actual physical location they connected to. This required us to build a high bandwidth, multipath backbone network that interconnected our data centers. Initially, this entailed building out our terrestrial fiber network to connect the various co-location facilities in California and Virginia to our new data centers in Oregon and North Carolina.\n\nAs our user base grew globally, we scaled beyond single data center buildings and into data center regions consisting of multiple buildings. We also aggressively built out our edge presence, where we now operate hundreds of points-of-presence (POPs) across the world.\n\nThe Challenges of Scaling (2010 – 2020)\n\nBuilding out a global infrastructure also brought along all of the complex corner cases of computer science.\n\nCache Consistency\n\nFirst, we needed to solve for cache consistency. We saw issues where people would receive notifications about being tagged in a photo, but couldn’t see the photo. Or people in a chat thread would receive messages out-of-order. These problems manifested because we were serving a fraction of our user base out of each data center region. People served out of the same region would receive notifications and see the right data, while people in a different region would experience a lag as the data update was replicated across our distributed fleet. This lag directly led to an inconsistent user experience. We solved these problems by building novel software systems that delivered cache invalidations, eventually building a consistency API for distributed systems.\n\nFleet management\n\nAs we added new data center regions and grew our machine fleet, we also had to develop new abstractions to manage them. This included systems and associated components like:\n\nTwine : a cluster management system that scales to manage millions of machines in a data center region.\n\nTectonic : a data center scale distributed file system.\n\nZippyDB : a strongly consistent distributed key value store.\n\nShard Manager : a global system to manage tens of millions of shards of data, hosted on hundreds of thousands of servers for hundreds of applications.\n\nDelos : a new control plane for our global infrastructure.\n\nService Router : to manage our global service mesh.\n\nWe developed the above systems, and many others, so we could operate a global fleet of millions of machines, while also providing excellent performance.\n\nMasking hardware failure\n\nMore machines also implies a higher likelihood of failure. To address this, we worked to ensure that we could mask failures from users and provide a highly available and accessible service. We accomplished this by building new systems like:\n\nKraken : which leverages live traffic load tests to identify and resolve resource utilization bottlenecks.\n\nTaiji : to manage user traffic load balancing.\n\nMaelstrom : which handled data center-scale disasters safely and efficiently while minimizing user impact.\n\nWe continue to invest heavily in reliability and fault tolerance as stability is critical for all the people who use our services to connect with their friends, family, and the businesses that serve them.\n\nEnter AI Workloads (2020)\n\nWhile we were navigating the challenges of scaling, we were also seeing glimpses of how AI workloads would impact our infrastructure.\n\nThe Emergence of GPUs\n\nOur first encounter with AI-induced infrastructure challenges actually started in the late 2010s when short-form videos were becoming very popular. The people who consumed this type of content wanted personalized recommendations – this differed dramatically from our format of ranking content to date.\n\nMeta’s apps were built on the premise that people are part of communities with shared interests. Thus, Facebook surfaced content based on what the community liked rather than having a direct understanding of the individual and their interests. In contrast, if you want to give people an entertaining stream of short form videos, you have to be able to understand all videos uploaded to the platform and pick videos that are interesting to every single person.\n\nThis is a significantly different problem. In the first case, all we’re ranking is content that someone’s friends (typically just a few hundred people) have interacted with. In this new model, we have to rank all content that has been uploaded, which is orders of magnitude larger than the number of friends each person has. And we need to produce this ranking not just once, but a custom ranking for each person for each piece of content.\n\nThis is where GPUs and other AI accelerators enter the picture. In contrast to a CPU which is primarily a load-store machine, a GPU is a vector and matrix processing machine which can perform orders of magnitude more computation than a CPU.\n\nWhen given an extremely large corpus of data, for example, a video library, we can build an embedding, which is a mathematical representation of each video as a vector of numbers. This vector captures the context of the video in a lower-dimensional space so that semantically similar content is positioned close to each other. We can now build a model that tracks the sequence of clicks a user makes as they navigate through a library of videos and predict future videos that they might be interested in. Thus, AI combines the mathematical notion of similarity in content, with the computational power of a GPU to provide personalized recommendations.\n\nInternet services scaled throughout the 2000s and 2010s by buying CPUs/memory/hard drives that were extremely cost efficient but unreliable, and then built software systems to mask failures. In contrast, an AI cluster is a high performance computational system consisting of hundreds or even thousands of extremely powerful GPUs with ample memory interconnected with a high bandwidth, a low latency network, and a custom software stack optimized to squeeze the maximum performance out of the system.\n\nOur initial AI clusters interconnected 4k GPUs that were used to train our ranking and recommendation models.\n\nThe Rise of Large Language Models (2022)\n\nThis remained the case until large language models (LLMs) started to take off in 2022. At the time, while our AI clusters were 4k in size, each of our training jobs tended to run on 128 GPUs.\n\nWhen we started to train LLMs, this quickly changed.\n\nLLMs required dramatically more compute capacity, and the more compute you were able to throw at the pretraining job, the better the model you were able to produce. In a few weeks, we had to scale our training job sizes from 128 GPUs to 2k and then 4k GPUs.\n\nFor the first time, we were regularly dealing with training jobs where we needed thousands of GPUs to run synchronously. Any single straggling GPU would hold up the performance of the entire cluster.\n\nWe quickly learned that scaling training jobs came with all kinds of challenges. GPUs can fail, memory can have errors, the network can experience jitter… And, as with traditional web workloads, the more machines you have, the more likely you are to experience failure. Except this time, it was not so easy to avoid the failures because, unlike the case of serving web requests — where you can simply retry your request on a different machine — in the case of AI training workloads, your entire training cluster is running one job, and any single failure can bring that job to a halt. If jobs fail too frequently, we stop making progress because of how long it takes to checkpoint and restart jobs. Through collaboration with the industry and our partners, we were able to drive the interruption rate down by ~50x (based on normalized interruption/reliability metrics).As we built larger clusters, we also invested in fundamental research and development across our AI Infrastructure. LLMs influenced how we developed our ranking and recommendation models. For instance, Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Units (HSTU) accelerated training and inference by 10-1000x for Generative Recommenders.\n\nAccelerating Our GPU Scale and AI Infrastructure (2023)\n\nAs we were working to get our 4k jobs to run well, we also realized we needed to figure out how to build even larger clusters. Taking advantage of what was available to us, we designed a cluster to use all the power available in a data center building, which is typically low 10s of megawatts. This led to us to build two clusters of 24k H100s each in late 2023, one using Infiniband and the other using RoCE. This allowed us to explore different network technologies while providing our AI teams with the capacity they needed to train increasingly larger LLM models such as Llama 3.\n\nWhile our two 24k clusters were amongst the largest in the world in 2023, our AI researchers were finding that the more computational power we dedicated to pre-training, the higher quality and more performant the LLM models became. Thus, our infrastructure engineers were tasked with scaling our AI cluster up by another order of magnitude.\n\nTo accomplish this, we did something we had never done in Meta’s history: As we mentioned, Meta’s data centers are usually deployed as regions of five or more identical buildings in a single location. By emptying out five production data centers we were able to build a single AI cluster with 129k H100 GPUs – all in a matter of months!\n\nThe final challenge that we are tackling is one of efficiency: What hardware and software solutions can most efficiently support the workloads we care about and maximize utilization of our data center capacity?\n\nUnfortunately, our AI workloads are not homogenous. The ranking and recommendation models that deliver personalized user experiences on our apps have different needs than LLMs. And LLMs themselves are rapidly evolving. We are quickly moving beyond the pre-training era to one where reinforcement learning, supervised fine tuning, test time inference, and reasoning are all increasing in importance and require custom hardware and software support.\n\nGiven the size of Meta’s AI ambitions, we need to work with different vendors to encourage market diversity. We believe that having multiple options leads to a healthier ecosystem and better solutions in the long run.\n\nTo build out our AI infrastructure, we’ve leveraged solutions from partners like AMD and NVIDIA as well as our own custom silicon. The image below shows a pod consisting of six racks. The middle two racks house 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs that consume ~140kW of power! We do not have facility liquid cooling in our traditional data centers, so we had to deploy four air assisted liquid cooling (AALC) racks so the heat wouldn’t melt the machines!\n\nThis pod, together, produces 360 PFLOPS of FP16 compute capacity. To put things in perspective, this pod consumes more than 800x the power a typical CPU consumes, and produces hundreds of thousand times the compute capacity! We are also starting to work with the next system, GB300, which is an improvement in many ways over GB200.\n\nWe have invested in other AI accelerators such as AMD’s MI300, which serves a variety of workloads at Meta. We have also invested heavily in the software layer to abstract away hardware differences from our developers as much as possible. Here is where open source software stacks such as PyTorch and Triton have really paid off for us.\n\nMeta Training & Inference Accelerator (MTIA)\n\nWe have also invested heavily in developing our own silicon. The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) is optimized for our ranking and recommendation inference workloads. This chip is now deployed at scale in our data centers, primarily serving our ads workloads, and has given us massive benefits in efficiency over vendor silicon.\n\nThis is only the beginning of our silicon program. Our training chip for ranking and recommendations is also starting to ramp up production. And we have multiple chips in various stages of development that we expect to deploy in the next couple of years.\n\nAs we’ve been diving further into designing our own silicon we’ve encountered some scaling challenges.\n\nThe Need for Advanced Packaging Techniques\n\nTransistors aren’t scaling at the same pace as the need for performance. Right now, reticle size is limited to 830 mm², which means that if anyone needs more performance than a single die can enable, their only option is to invest in more dies.\n\nWorking with LLMs we’ve found that the need to scale is so innate that it forces us into this exact scenario to keep up with the performance needs of each new model generation. The challenge is only compounded by the fact that these dies can only be placed adjacently through advanced 2.5D and 3D packaging, which limits the size of the arrays we can build and creates concerns around energy efficiency and cooling as well.\n\nWe suspect that, along with advanced cooling solutions, advanced packaging techniques can help overcome these challenges by integrating multiple chiplets, or diverse capabilities (compute, memory, I/O).\n\nInvesting in Solutions for Memory Disaggregation\n\nThe rise of reasoning models, test-time inference, and reinforcement learning are all adding additional pressure to memory subsystems. We are starting to stack high-bandwidth memory (HBM) adjacent to the compute chiplets to maximize I/O bandwidth. But we only have so much silicon beachfront, so we have to make hard tradeoffs between the computational capability of the chip, versus memory size, versus network bandwidth. Not to mention that adding several HBMs creates more cooling concerns.\n\nInvesting in higher performance networks instead and locating high bandwidth memory off-chip, or even off machines, might mitigate these issues.\n\nThe Case for Silicon Photonics\n\nAs we have been planning our silicon roadmap, we’ve found that the minimum power budget for each rack has grown dramatically. We’re building larger and larger interconnected chips, and that comes with increasing power demands.\n\nSilicon photonics, which offer a range of benefits, such as allowing for faster signaling over larger distances, could significantly reduce the rack’s overall power consumption.\n\nAdvanced optical solutions like these are also the only viable path to increasing shoreline beyond 3.2T and moving beyond the constraints of backplanes required to connect more endpoints.\n\nThese solutions would come with challenges of their own, such as higher power consumption and less reliability compared to electrical signaling. Ultimately, future solutions will have to be interoperable between different technologies and vendors, more reliable than electrical signaling, and capable of being manufactured at a high volume.\n\nWe are actively engaging in research to tackle these difficult hardware challenges and collaborating with the industry ecosystem to evolve the field and develop higher performance hardware.\n\nThe Role of Open Standards in Scaling AI\n\nWhile the proliferation of hardware provides options and allows us to handle workload heterogeneity by matching customized solutions that optimize for each need, they also create management challenges for hyperscalers, cloud operators, and hardware and software developers.\n\nFrom an operator point of view, it is difficult for Meta to deal with 5-6 different SKUs of hardware deployed every year. Heterogeneity of the fleet makes it difficult to move workloads around, leading to underutilized hardware. It is difficult for software engineers to think about building and optimizing workloads for different types of hardware. If new hardware necessitates the rewriting of libraries, kernels, and applications, then there will be strong resistance to adoption of new hardware. In fact, the current state of affairs is making it hard for hardware companies to design products because it is difficult to know what data center, rack, or power specifications to build for.\n\nWhat is needed here are open standards, open weight models, and open source software.\n\nOpen source software like PyTorch and Triton can help by providing a consistent programming interface for machine learning developers and researchers. Open weight models give application developers cost efficient access to high quality LLMs, and at the same time, give infrastructure and hardware engineers a standard workload to optimize for.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we’ve been strong supporters of open hardware for data center infrastructure. We were a founding member of the Open Compute Project and continue to be a leading contributor of technical content and IP into it. Since its inception, Meta has made 187 contributions (approximately 25% of all tech contributions) to OCP. Working with the OCP community has benefited us operationally by improving consistency in our fleet, financially through economies of scale, and technologically by enabling companies to come together and debate solutions. While we’ve seen this produce great results in our general purpose compute fleet, the benefits will only be amplified in the era of AI.\n\nLast year at the annual OCP Global Summit, for example, we unveiled Catalina, our open-design, high-powered rack for AI workloads, and a new version of Grand Teton, our AI hardware platform that features a single monolithic system design with fully integrated power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces.\n\nBut we have a long way to go in continuing to push open standards. We need standardization of systems, racks and power as rack power density continues to increase. These common abstractions help us continue to innovate quickly and deploy at scale as we build out the next generation of data centers and power grids. An example of this standardization is the recent push to adapt the Open Compute rack standards to accommodate AI needs.\n\nWe need standardization of the scale up and scale out network that these AI clusters use so that customers can mix/match different GPUs and accelerators to always use the latest and more cost effective hardware. We need software innovation and standards to allow us to run jobs across heterogeneous hardware types that may be spread in different geographic locations. These open standards need to exist all the way through the stack, and there are massive opportunities to eliminate friction that is slowing down the build out of AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Next Stage (2026 and Beyond)\n\nNo one can say for certain how the AI field will continue to evolve. Yet, what we do know is that computational capability is key to building higher quality models.\n\nAt Meta, our goal is to build models that will deliver the best, most engaging experiences, and act as personal assistants to each one of the billions of people that use our products every day.\n\nBuilding the infrastructure for models this sophisticated means actively addressing challenges throughout our data centers – everything from advanced packaging, thermal management, power delivery, to memory disaggregation, while enabling scalable networks through optics.\n\nOur next AI cluster, Prometheus, will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings. Constructing Prometheus has been a monumental engineering feat, with infrastructure spanning five or more data center buildings in a single data center region. While a region is large, it is a small fraction of a gigawatt facility. Thus, we needed to find innovative ways to scale: We accomplished this by building this cluster across several of our traditional data center buildings as well as several weatherproof tents, and adjacent colocation facilities. We are also evolving our software stack, including Twine and MAST, to support long-distance training across a geographically distributed set of data centers.\n\nWe also have an even larger cluster, Hyperion, expected to come online beginning in 2028. Once finished, the Hyperion cluster will have the ability to scale up to a capacity of 5 gigawatts.\n\nWe are still early in the evolution and adoption of AI workloads. The last few years have been busy, but the next few years are going to move at an even faster pace. The demands AI will push on hardware show no signs of slowing down.",

      "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory activity probably shrank for a sixth straight month in September, keeping alive calls for more stimulus in the world's second-largest economy to fend off a sharp slowdown as a U.S. trade deal remains distant.\n\nThe survey of 32 economists forecast the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) would edge up to 49.6 from August's 49.4, remaining below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction. The data is due on Tuesday.\n\nThe prolonged slump underlines the twin pressures on China's economy: domestic demand has failed to mount a durable recovery in the years since the pandemic while U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have squeezed Chinese factories as well as overseas firms that buy components for finished goods.\n\nMalaysia's Maybank Investment Bank returned the highest poll reading of 50.0, indicating no change, while Pantheon Macroeconomics gave the lowest forecast of 49.0.\n\nPolicymakers rolled out a series of consumer loan subsidies in mid-August, a decision vindicated by separate factory output and retail sales data for the month, which saw their weakest growth in 12 months.\n\nPan Gongsheng, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said last week a range of monetary policy tools to support the economy remained available, but refrained from following the U.S. Federal Reserve with a rate cut, as some economists speculated the central bank might.\n\nDespite signs the $19 trillion economy is losing momentum, authorities appear in no hurry to roll out major stimulus measures, given resilient exports and a stock market rally, market watchers say.\n\nChina's exports to regional rival India hit an all-time high in August, customs data showed, while shipments to Africa and Southeast Asia are on track for annual records.\n\nBut no other country comes close to the consumption power of the U.S., where Chinese producers sell more than $400 billion worth of goods annually, accounting for around 14% of total exports.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping phoned Trump on September 19 for the first time in three months, and while the call appeared to ease tensions, it remains unclear whether it yielded the expected agreement on popular short-video app TikTok, which analysts see as key to a broader trade deal.\n\nDisagreements on technical details appeared to be weighing on negotiations, as Chinese and U.S. trade officials met again last Thursday to revisit issues discussed in talks before this month's Madrid summit, where a framework TikTok deal was reached.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters forecast the private sector RatingDog PMI to come in at 50.2, down from 50.5 a month prior. The data will also be released on September 30.\n\n(Reporting by Joe Cash; Polling by Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan and Devayani Sathyan in Bengaluru and Jing Wang in Shanghai; Editing by Sam Holmes amd Kate Mayberry)",

      "content": "ISELIN, N.J., Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: OTLK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on optimizing the standard of care for bevacizumab for the treatment of retina diseases, today announced that it has completed the Type A Meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the complete response letter (CRL) dated August 27, 2025 regarding the biologics license application (BLA) resubmission for ONS-5010, an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab under development to treat wet AMD. Based on the discussion with the FDA, Outlook Therapeutics expects to resubmit its BLA before the end of calendar year 2025, after reviewing the agency’s feedback and meeting minutes.\n\n“We had a productive discussion with the FDA. Based on our meeting, and pending receipt of the agency’s written minutes, we plan to resubmit the BLA later this year. We remain committed to providing patients, physicians and payors in the U.S. with a safe and effective ophthalmic bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD,” commented Bob Jahr, Chief Executive Officer of Outlook Therapeutics.\n\nAbout ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg, bevacizumab gamma)\n\nONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ is an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD. LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab gamma) is the subject of a centralized Marketing Authorization granted by the European Commission in the EU and Marketing Authorization granted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK for the treatment of wet AMD.\n\nIn the United States, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg) is investigational. In certain European Union Member States ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ must receive pricing and reimbursement approval before it can be sold.\n\nBevacizumab-vikg (bevacizumab gamma in the EU and UK) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively binds with high affinity to all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neutralizes VEGF’s biologic activity through a steric blocking of the binding of VEGF to its receptors Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2) on the surface of endothelial cells. Following intravitreal injection, the binding of bevacizumab to VEGF prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation in the retina.\n\nAbout Outlook Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nOutlook Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg, bevacizumab gamma) to optimize the standard of care for bevacizumab for the treatment of retina diseases. LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab gamma) is the first ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab to receive European Commission and MHRA Marketing Authorization for the treatment of wet AMD. Outlook Therapeutics commenced commercial launch of LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab gamma) in Germany and the UK as a treatment for wet AMD.\n\nIn the United States, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg) is investigational. If approved in the United States, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™, would be the first approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in retinal indications, including wet AMD.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

      "content": "EnergyBook Pro Ultra packs a 192Wh battery, the largest ever fitted into a laptop\n\nAvenir Telecom claims up to 28 hours of use and a week on standby\n\nAt 192Wh, the laptop unfortunately exceeds aviation limits for carry-on batteries\n\nEnergizer, better known for batteries and smartphones, is launching a new laptop that puts endurance ahead of all else.\n\nThe EnergyBook Pro Ultra comes with a 192Wh lithium-polymer monobloc, which the company says is the largest battery ever built into a laptop.\n\nAvenir Telecom, the French company which designs and manufactures Energizer-branded hardware, claims the new laptop can last for up to 28 hours of regular office work, or around 11 hours of gaming and graphics-heavy tasks. In standby mode, it can reportedly go a whole week without needing to be charged.\n\nThat just won't fly\n\n“With the EnergyBook Pro Ultra, we’re pushing the boundaries of what laptops look like. It’s packed with power, battery life, and durability - true to Energizer’s DNA,” noted Julien Galou, head of marketing at Avenir Telecom.\n\nThe company has form when it comes to packing large batteries into devices - in 2024, it rolled out the Hard Case P28K rugged smartphone with a huge 28,000mAh battery, promising a talk time of 122 hours (roughly five days) and a standby time of 2,253 hours or a little over three months.\n\nBattery aside, the specifications for the EnergyBook Pro Ultra laptop are otherwise decidedly mid-range.\n\nThe system features an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD and an 18-inch Full HD+ display.\n\nAre you a pro?

No word on when or where it will be available though.\n\nOne detail may limit its audience, however. Aviation safety rules restrict lithium-ion batteries on flights to 100Wh in carry-on luggage, with some airlines allowing up to 160Wh with special approval.\n\nAt 192Wh, the EnergyBook Pro Ultra exceeds both limits, making it unlikely to be permitted on most commercial flights (some airlines may not check, but it’s worth being aware).\n\nThe EnergyBook Pro Ultra is part of a wider line, which also includes 15- and 18-inch models with smaller batteries.\n\nWith the Ultra’s record-breaking size, Energizer has created a laptop that could struggle to live up to its promise of mobility.",

      "content": "HP EliteBook 6 G1q ZDNET's key takeaways The EliteBook 6 G1q is currently available for $1,382 at B&H Photo-Video.\n\nIt's a sleek and battery-efficient laptop with lots of ports and 5G connectivity.\n\nIt occupies that middle ground where a few hundred dollars more could get you a substantially more premium laptop. $1,382.95 at B&H Photo-Video\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nHP's EliteBook 6 G1q is an affordable model from its productivity-minded lineup. It features extensive connectivity and a marathon battery in a thin and lightweight form factor.\n\nPreviously known as HP's 600 series, the EliteBook 6 G1 lineup is available in multiple RAM and memory configurations, a lightweight form factor, and either an AMD, Intel, or Qualcomm processor; a highly customizable laptop for a wide range of users.\n\nAlso: Why this portable hotspot may be my favorite travel gadget of the year\n\nI went hands-on with the EliteBook G1q (q for Qualcomm), which has the Snapdragon X Plus chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD. I found it to be a capable device with great battery life and a very comfortable keyboard. I'd recommend it as a lightweight work laptop, but there are a few concerns.\n\nThe entry-level machine with 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD looks to be aimed at users who live in the cloud and value longevity over raw power, while higher-end hardware opens up the device for more diverse productivity uses.\n\nThe middle-of-the-road configuration I tested displays the performance you'd expect from a thin and light Snapdragon device. It boots up instantaneously, is highly responsive for everyday tasks, and has an efficient battery for all-day use.\n\nOn the surface, the EliteBook 6 G1q is nondescript and commercial, with HP's typical silver aluminum build, a gray keyboard, and a utilitarian display. But it also has an extensive selection of customizability, up to 64GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and numerous display options, including an 800-nit WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS screen at the top end.\n\nAlso: I tested Acer's $299 smart monitor, and it's a tariff-smart option I can get behind\n\nThe model I tested came with a WUXGA (1920x1200) IPS display with 300 nits of brightness and a 60Hz refresh rate. It's not quite what I'd call premium, but it gets the job done for work-related tasks, especially with the matte finish that mitigates glare well.\n\nAt 3.17 pounds, it's right around where it should be in terms of portability. It easily slides into a backpack or bag and lives up to its intended use case as a device for remote and hybrid workers.\n\nA touchscreen option is available, as are higher resolutions and refresh rates with a few hundred bucks added onto the price, but the upgrades add up quickly, approaching price points you'd get for more premium EliteBook models.\n\nThe right side of the laptop features a lock slot, ethernet port, USB-A, and nano SIM slot. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nOne of the notable available features is the Snapdragon X72 5G card, which grants the laptop 5G connectivity, a solid option for users who need always-on connectivity in the field or away from Wi-Fi.\n\nThe feature is enabled with a service called HP Go, which uses an eSIM with multi-carrier 5G connectivity for $19 a month. It works by using infrastructure from the top three US carrier networks, whichever has the strongest available connection in the area.\n\nThis type of service can be critical for users who need a reliable connection in locations with unavailable or spotty Wi-Fi, but it is more geared toward the enterprise use case. That said, for anyone who travels and ends up having to pay for hotel Wi-Fi or struggling with terrible, unsecure connections, the $19 a month could be worth it.\n\nAlso: Is this the most promising Chromebook yet? This Acer has specs that almost rival my MacBook\n\nSpeaking of enterprise connectivity, this laptop has some pretty robust I/O, including an HDMI port, two USB-Cs, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-A, a Kensington lock slot, a microSD, and even an Ethernet port. Thus, it's a highly compatible device that enterprise teams will appreciate.\n\nIt's also an enjoyable laptop to work on, as the keyboard is particularly nice. I found the large, sticky keys with nice key travel to be responsive and well-designed, except the Page Up and Page Down buttons near the arrow keys is a key placement choice I'm not a fan of.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nIn terms of performance, the EliteBook 6 G1q feels a lot like its Copilot+ PC peers with similar hardware. I had no issues with daily tasks during my week with this laptop, and I appreciate its snappy boot times and strong ability to multitask.\n\nThe EliteBook 6 G1q has the same 45 TOPS NPU as its X Elite counterpart, qualifying it as an official Copilot+ PC. Local AI tasks should run smoothly for everyday tasks, like HP's Poly camera pro feature, which is one of the better AI-powered videoconferencing suites to come pre-loaded.\n\nThe AI works with multiple cameras to create overlays and AI-generated backgrounds, but for most users, it just means it will automatically adjust to lighting conditions to improve your presence on camera.\n\nOur benchmarking numbers place it right around its competitors, earning scores in balanced mode that place it where it theoretically should be in comparison to higher-end EliteBook models, like the G1 series I tested earlier this year.\n\nUsers have the option to customize the battery on this laptop, with a 48Whr or 56Whr 3-cell unit, both with HP's fast charge. Either way, you'll get great battery longevity here. HP says you'll get over 24 hours of battery life in video playback in balanced mode. In my experience, I made it through two full workdays of intermittent sustained/idle usage on one charge.\n\nAlso: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for free today\n\nOne thing of note with this laptop is the heat generation, which I was a little surprised to experience with the Snapdragon X Plus processor. This also applies to the ports: the left side of the laptop (where the USB-C ports are located) gets palpably warm when both are in use, but not so much that it's significantly uncomfortable.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThe high degree of customization, commercial build, extensive I/O, and 5G connectivity make the EliteBook 6 G1q a quintessential enterprise PC. The hardware on board is expressly geared toward productivity tasks, and the battery-efficient Snapdragon X rounds out the user experience.\n\nThe display is fine, but nothing overly premium. Although the build is nondescript and corporate, it's sleek and lightweight, with a comfortable keyboard and trackpad. If you're looking for a more premium productivity laptop from HP, however, check out the EliteBook G1a at the top of the lineup.\n\nAlso: This HP EliteBook I tested is one of the most versatile work laptops of 2025 - and it's on sale\n\nIf you're looking for something similar in terms of performance, form factor, and battery life, check out the OmniBook X with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, which doesn't have 5G connectivity, but is less than half the price.",

      "content": "Jtuck9 Interesting to see how they perform in the handheld space. I thought they seemed more tailored toward workstations with emphasis on AI?!\n\nWell, by the looks of it, AT4 should be able to rival a PS5 at very low power, and AT3 able to rival a PS5pro at very low power (or PS5 at VERY VERY low power). I think many people will find that compelling.Then ofc there are (more-or-less) configs of AT2 that would appear to find themselves into the next-gen consoles.Then we have AT0 essentially built for AI. If those will be connected in such a config idk, but it's certainly possible.I know this goes outside the realm of this article (as I doubt anything beyond AT2 would be bonded to another in this fashion), but I wonder if AMD is holding AT1 until after 32Gigabit/40gbps GDDR7 exists.I say this because Hynix 32Gigabit/10gbps HBM4e is coming in 2027,and I imagine GDDR7 will follow/be similar, as RAM generations are usually 18 months apart, pegging that at perhaps around the end of 2027.That said, if you start to think about AT2, which might be an amazing chip, perhaps rivaling 6080 (if not just being a better alternative to 6070ti/6070), it does appear another config edging the 'forever' GPU people want to upsell to the cut-down consumer AT0 most people don't really need.In my mind that would be 32GB (which would require 4GB chips on a 256-bit bus for a single-sided config) and exceeding 100TF...which should handle anything creators make for a very long while.Both AT2 and perhaps 6080 may target being below one or two of these metrics purposely; AMD perhaps with 18 and then 24GB configs, nVIDIA 24 then 32GB...but both perhaps targeting <100TF (or so; 4k60mins).It would require an absurdly high clock with AT2's config (even if AMD targets high clocks on N3P) and buffer may become an issue long-term, while nVIDIA may target power/area with lower clocks on their design(s)The nVIDIA design *could* potentially pull it out if they choose, but they've been known to edge people and push them toward an upsell of their Halo. AMD may or may not do the same (long-term).Enter such a chip, which could steal the show (especially considering 3nm will be a fairly old process by then). With (if nothing else) 40gbps available/cheaper...that's what I'm personally most excited about.Given AMD's choice to pair these chiplets, their targets, the ubiquity of their performance, and the tiers of performance the GPUs should offer, I am very optimistic across markets and performance levels.Both in the foreseeable and even slightly further future.",

      "headline": "Intel aims at AMD's Threadripper with its new Granite Rapids-WS CPU — chip armed with core count approaching the flagship AMD Threadripper 9995WX, boasts a 4.8GHz boost clock",
      "content": "It looks like Intel is getting ready to launch a new branch of Granite Rapids processors designed to compete directly with AMD’s Ryzen 9000WX series parts based on Zen 5. Resident X poster Momomo_us found an openbenchmark.org listing featuring an 86-core CPU codenamed Granite Rapid-WS.\n\nThe only specs we have are the cores, threads, and clock speed, featuring the aforementioned 86 cores and 172 threads operating at up to 4.8GHz. But being based on the Granite Rapids architecture, it is very likely that this chip is a much higher clocking offshoot of the Xeon 6787P, which also boasts 86 cores across two compute tiles, but peaks at a 3.8GHz peak turbo clock speed.\n\nAt 86 cores, this new chip is approaching the core count of AMD’s current Threadripper flagship, the 9995WX with 96 Zen 5 cores. This SKU might not even be the flagship part since Granite Rapids can scale up to 128 cores. Only time will tell if this is the case — to reach 128 cores, Intel has to use three compute dies, whereas with its 86-core Granite Rapid SKUs, it only needs to use two. Limiting Granite Rapids-WS to 86 cores has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs for Intel.\n\nRumors have been circulating about a workstation-offshoot of Granite Rapids for months. In February, we covered a Granite Rapids-W leak, allegedly stating these new workstation parts will come with up to 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, feature eight-channel DDR5 memory support, and support Intel’s outgoing W890 chipset.\n\nGranite Rapids is Intel’s latest generation server architecture, and one of its most competitive yet, featuring core count parity with AMD EYPC processors for the first time since 2017, when it launched in the Xeon 6900P series late last year. Similar to Arrow Lake-S, Granite Rapids is based on a tile-based architecture, featuring several I/O and compute tiles to reach previously untouchable core counts.\n\nIntel hasn’t had a serious CPU lineup that has been able to compete with AMD’s Threadripper WX-series parts over the past two generations. Its outgoing W-3500 Sapphire Rapids Refresh chips only scale up to 60 cores, while AMD has had 96-core trims since the Threadripper 7000WX series and 64-core chips dating all the way back to the Threadripper 3000 series. With Granite Rapids-WS, Intel has its first opportunity in years to approach or outpace AMD on core count in the HEDT/workstation segment, similar to the server market.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "headline": "No, Dedicated AI Buttons on Laptops Are Not Going to Sell More PCs",
      "content": "We’ll be waiting until next year for the first round of PCs sporting Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip, plus whatever Intel and AMD have in store for lightweight laptops. As a hint of what to expect, in stepped a company nobody had ever heard of, offering a laptop few people wanted. Humain (no, not that AI wearable company that bricked its wonky AI Pin and sold itself to HP for peanuts), a Saudi Arabian company, debuted a laptop at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), that looks like every other clamshell notebook, save for one small detail. Instead of the Copilot key that’s become standardized on Windows machines, it features an “Humain” AI key.\n\nHumain’s laptop is a Windows machine at its heart, powered by the Snapdragon X2 Elite chip. But the AI key brings up an extra layer of UI called Humain One. Through the interface, you can call up an AI chatbot, an AI image generator, and a few more semi-interesting capabilities. There’s a special chatbot for homework help, document summaries, or a “Story Generator.” The AI will create a narrative using the average third-grade reading level.\n\nIt’s nothing we haven’t seen before, most obviously from Microsoft’s own Copilot AI, which is built into the company’s 365 apps and desktop. Humain usurped Copilot’s new laptop with the promise that at least some of the AI processes are being handled on-device. The notebook is otherwise packing solid-sounding specs, from an OLED display designed by Samsung, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. No, the company didn’t have any word about how much the machine will cost, or when, or where it will be available. There’s no word if it will come to the U.S., either. The only question remaining is, would you want it to?\n\nApps still don’t make use of new laptops’ AI capabilities\n\nI spent all of Snapdragon Summit barely able to take in the epic sights of Maui through the haze of big tech AI hype. Qualcomm’s new slogan, “AI is the new UI,” ran like a river through every new announcement and demo. Qualcomm wanted to imply that on-device AI will be able to look into your fridge and suggest meals (Samsung’s fridges already do that). You can use an AI app called Collov AI to remodel rooms in your house with new furniture, though it currently doesn’t have any hookup to major furniture retailers to see how products you can actually buy might look in your abode. It’s nothing I haven’t seen before; only now these features are supposedly running on the device, versus in the cloud.\n\nQualcomm’s explanation for how this works suggests that the new Snapdragon X2 Elite chip for PCs has such strong AI processing capabilities, but if a laptop or mini-PC using it ever gets overwhelmed, it can bring in the big guns—the major datacenters with such massive cloud compute they could suck the power grid dry. On-device AI should be the goal for every company. AI models are getting better at being contained. The Snapdragon X2 Elite’s redesigned NPU—or neural processing engine built for low-key or background AI tasks—now sports 80 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) versus the 45 TOPS on the original Snapdragon X platform.\n\nWhat that translates to is still vague. Collov AI, the home decoration app, was tasking the NPU at just 10%. The GPU, or graphics processing unit, was taking the brunt of the rest of the AI image generation. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with that, though I have yet to see a demo that can truly tax the NPU.\n\nBetter chips are getting more expensive\n\nI ran multiple benchmark tests on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme platform, all done on non-commercial test machines with 48GB of RAM and 1TB SSD under the hood. I was standing in front of many Qualcomm reps ready to slap my hand if I tried jumping for any non-synthetic benchmark. From what I could see, the chip does have more power behind it than previous Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm chips. The problem is that when you try and benchmark for AI performance, even if the chip does well, it’s too difficult to determine what that translates to when you’re using the device as a daily driver.\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme’s GPU was especially impressive. The laptops managed to hit a score of 5,648 and an average of 41 fps in 3DMark’s Steel Nomad Light test and 23,586 in the Solar Bay benchmark. It all suggests that laptops with the Snapdragon X2 Extreme chip will be great for graphics tasks, but the issue will be the number of apps and drivers that are compatible with Qualcomm’s ARM-based chip. Apps like Maxon’s ZBrush should have an ARM version by early 2026, but good luck trying to get any gaming done on these machines.\n\nThese tests can only offer a perspective of what users could potentially expect from actual products. I couldn’t possibly say how much the X2 Elite Extreme laptops will cost in this age of tariffs. Recent rumors suggested TSMC, which manufactures these chips, is going to pass tariff costs for 3nm process CPUs onto Qualcomm and fellow chipmaker MediaTek.\n\n“It’s [TSMC’s] choice to try to figure out what to do with the pricing structure,” said Alex Katouzian, Qualcomm’s head of compute and mobile. “What we constantly think about is, ‘How do I get the most efficient design, meaning performance per millimeter square?'”",

      "headline": "Trump’s tariff‑shaped stick can’t beat reality on US chip fabbing",
      "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

      "headline": "Linux Kernel 6.17 Released, This is What’s New",
      "content": "EXT4 filesystem boosts – and changes to help SSDs last longer\n\nLinus Torvalds has announced the release of Linux kernel 6.17, an update that brings improved hardware support and a number of core system improvements.\n\nThe new kernel provides graphic drivers for the latest Intel ‘Panther Lake’ laptops, better power management features for devices with AMD hybrid GPUs, resolves a software bug that’s been knocking around since 1993, and helps SSDs last longer.\n\nAnnouncing the release on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), Linus Torvalds says: “No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go.”\n\nUbuntu 25.10 ships wit the new kernel, including in the beta build that was released last week. Users on the current long-term support release, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, will receive kernel 6.17 as part of the next hardware enablement (HWE) update in early 2026.\n\nIs this kernel a solid upgrade? You know it is! For a whip through the new features in Linux 6.17 which caught my eye, read on.\n\nLinux 6.17: What’s New?\n\nGraphics & Gaming\n\nAlienware’s ‘boost’ key (top row) gets a standardised keycode\n\nThe first Core Ultra Series 3 laptops powered by Intel ‘Panther Lake’ chips are due to go on sale soon, so it’s timely that Intel Xe3 integrated graphics are enabled by default in Linux 6.17. This ensures anyone bagging a new model and installing Ubuntu 25.10 gets solid graphics performance off the bat.\n\nSmartMux in 6.17 will switch between integrated and discrete graphics on AMD laptops\n\nFor those using laptops equipped with Core Ultra Series 2 (‘Lunar Lake’) chips, the Intel IPU7 driver has proper web camera support. Ideal for online meetings, social chats and accidental jump-scares when launching the camera app by accident.\n\nAMD hybrid GPU laptops gain SmartMux support with Linux 6.17. This auto-switches between integrated and discrete graphics based on workload to (obviously) save power or deliver maximum performance if needed.\n\nLenovo WMI Gaming Series Drivers add support for both Legion Go and the SteamOS-powered Legion Go S handheld, which will be especially handy for those looking to run other kinds of Linux-based operating systems on the AMD-powered handheld.\n\nThe kernel also standardises the keycode used by the (mysterious) “performance boost” key on newer Dell and Alienware laptops, and the (rather frutiger aero-looking) Flydigi Apex 5 game controller now has proper support on Linux — nice!\n\nOn a tangentially gaming-related note, the networking stack adds DualPI2 congestion control support. This helps to reduce network queue latency, which should prove beneficial for online gaming, streaming, video calls, and other real-time applications.\n\nFilesystem changes\n\nKernel write changes may help SSDs last longer\n\nThere are many filesystems improvements in 6.17 that will be directly appreciable by those of us running a desktop Linux distribution (not just the one this site is named after, either).\n\nUbuntu’s default file system is EXT4, and Linux 6.17 sees major performance boosts\n\nPerhaps most significant: the kernel can now write zeroes efficiently without actual I/O operations on NVMe SSDs that support the DEAC bit, and SCSI SSDs which support the UMMAP bit (a ‘bit’ is a kind of indicator of a feature state).\n\nThe FALLOC_FL_WRITE_ZEROES option for fallocate() will mark storage regions as zero-filled internally on modern SSDs. This will improve performance and reduce wear (SSDs theoretically have finite read/write lifespans, so fewer writes = lasts longer).\n\nUbuntu’s default filesystem EXT4 improves block allocation scalability. Per benchmarks, this provides noticeable performance benefits under I/O heavy tasks like querying databases or copying large numbers of files.\n\nBtrfs adds experimental large-folio support, which reduces memory management overhead when handling large files. This, combined with compression control during defragmentation, makes Btrfs better suited to performance-sensitive workloads.\n\nEROFS supports metadata compression and faster directory reading, which should prove especially handy on systems with read-only root filesystems or in container-heavy workloads. There’s no Bcachefs in the 6.17 merge reports…\n\nLaptop Support\n\nMacBook Pro touchbar becoming ever-more-functional in Linux\n\nLinux support on M1 and M2 Macs continues to improve in Linux 6.17, with the Apple Silicon SMC driver enabling ‘proper’ rebooting of M1 and M2 Macs. With work to run Linux on M3 and M4 Macs in limbo, it’s nice earlier gens are improving their mainline support.\n\nThe Touch Bar on Intel-based MacBook Pros see further improvements in Linux 6.17 with patches to enable touch screen input, albeit with a few lingering quirks. Apple ends support for Intel-based Macs after macOS 26, so Linux will give those devices a new lease of life.\n\nElsewhere, Linux 6.17 brings mainline support for ASUS Zenbook A14 Snapdragon X1 Plus/Elite laptops, allowing more Linux distributions to run on these ARM-based Windows devices. There’s also mainline support for Raspberry Pi 5’s RP1 I/O chip.\n\nGot a keyboard with F13-F24 keys? Those are now properly mapped in Linux 6.17\n\nSupport for Corsair HX1200i PSU monitoring (2025 model) is present; wake-on-touch support added to the Intel Touch Host Controller (along with overlay objects support, great for tablet and 2-in-1 users); and kernel mapping for F13 – F24 keys on PS/2 keyboards.\n\nYes, keyboards with an addition 12 function keys actually exist!\n\nHD Audio support is extended to cover the Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300, commercial ASUS laptops using CS35L41 HDA, and HP EliteBook models. USB audio offloading (a feature in Linux 6.xx) covers more mobile devices, including Fairphone 4.\n\nCore kernel changes\n\nNew Attack Vector Controls have been integrated to simplify security handling for known CPU vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown. Previously, each mitigation had its own kernel command-line option. In 6.17, there’s a unified option.\n\nMaking it easier for Linux server admins (and others) to disable unneeded protections may help them claw back performance dips certain mitigations require as well make it easier to manage the growing number of hardware vulnerability bandaids.\n\nSupport for uniprocessor configuration has been removed from the kernel scheduler. Every machine, even those which run on a single-core processor will now ‘unconditionally’ run a kernel designed for multicore systems.\n\nThis shouldn’t lead to any detrimental impact on single-core systems (not that many folks likely run one full-time in 2025), but adopting a unified scheduling approach across all CPUs should reduce code and make kernel behaviour more reliable.\n\nSpeed Boosts?\n\nLinux 6.17 picks up initial proxy execution support. This new kernel feature may speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when a high-priority application is waiting for a resource, the system temporarily gives the resource holder a boost, causing it to finish and release the resource faster.\n\nA new kernel feature could speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when high-priority tasks are waiting for a resource\n\nOr to word it the way kernel devs would, this resolves “priority-inversion problems” by enabling “high-priority tasks waiting for locks to donate execution context to lock holders”, which reduces latency spikes — slowdowns — in desktop apps.\n\nMemory management sees various optimisations across the kernel subsystems, notable with improved futex performance for heavily threaded applications (and more reliable crash kernel handling for debugging when things go wrong).\n\nAMD’s Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI) was added. Modern processors mix two types of cores: performance and efficiency. On AMD, HFI gives the kernel info to help it decide which core is better suited to which tasks, improving performance and power management.\n\nWeird Stuff\n\nLinux 6.17 removes the Pktcdvd packet-writing optical driver. It was deprecated in 2016, survived a removal attempt in 2023, but now, in 2025 optical packet-writing is definitively done and dusted! A loss for those who liked it, but a curio for those who’d never heard of it…\n\nThere’s also a bug fix for a kernel limitation dating back to 1993. It’s related to ELF program header handling that causes some applications in certain conditions to bug out. After 30 years, someone has finally bothered to fix it properly.\n\nOther Changes:\n\nBeyond the highlights above, some other notable changes in Linux 6.17:\n\nBPF subsystem adds standard string operations\n\nBPF programs have output and error streams for userspace communication\n\nExtended attributes support for pidfds\n\nNew DAMON_STAT kernel module for simplified memory activity monitoring\n\nTCP stack now enforces receive window limits more strictly\n\nASoC adds AMD ACP7.2 platform support\n\nKernel live patch support on 64-bit ARM\n\nTurbostat utility gains L3 cache topology display\n\nFor more detail on the release as whole read through the comprehensive merge report recaps (first half & second half) put out by the folks at LWN, or sift through the thousands of kernel commits on GitHub (grab a coffee before doing that, eh).\n\nUpgrade to Linux 6.17\n\nLinux 6.17 is available for download from kernel.org as source, but you will need to compile that source code by hand to make use of it — not for the faint of heart!\n\nUbuntu 25.10 includes Linux 6.17 by default, and the release will be back-ported to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS users in early 2026.\n\nIt will not be packaged for and uploaded to Ubuntu repositories for other supported releases officially, but it is possible to make use of Canonical Mainline DEBs or third-party PPAs unofficially — not without caveats, however.\n\nInstalling newer Linux kernels on Ubuntu from outside of the main repos comes with no guarantees and no support. They may lack Ubuntu-specific patches and drivers, not work in with some hardware or lack feature integrations.",

      "headline": "Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI investment raises eyebrows and a key question: How much of the AI boom is just Nvidia’s cash being recycled?",
      "content": "Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently. The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back.\n\nIn addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.\n\nThe extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.\n\nIn past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.\n\nNvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.\n\n繼續閱讀\n\nStartups financing data centers have often had to borrow money at rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% that a large, established corporation such as Microsoft might have to pay. With Nvidia’s backing, OpenAI and Coreweave have been able to borrow at rates closer to what Microsoft or Google might pay.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also signed a $6.3 billion deal to purchase any cloud capacity that CoreWeave can’t sell to others. The chipmaker had previously agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years on cloud computing with CoreWeave. Coreweave, meanwhile, has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs so far—the majority of which it says are H100 Hopper models, which cost about $30,000 each—which means Coreweave has spent about $7.5 billion buying these chips from Nvidia. So in essence, all of the money Nvidia has invested in Coreweave has come back to it in the form of revenue.\n\n\n\nNvidia has struck similar cloud computing deals with other so-called “neo-cloud” companies. According to a story in The Information, Nvidia agreed this summer to spend $1.3 billion over four years renting some 10,000 of its own AI chips from Lambda, which like Coreweave runs data centers, as well as a separate $200 million deal to rent some 8,000 more over an unspecified time period.\n\nFor those who believe there’s an AI bubble, the Lambda deal is clear evidence of froth. Those Nvidia chips Lambda is renting time on back to Nvidia? It bought them with borrowed money collateralized by the value of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\n\nBesides its large investments in OpenAI and Coreweave, AI chipmaker also holds multi-million dollar stakes in several other publicly-traded companies that either purchase its GPUs or work on related chip technology. These include chip design firm Arm, high-performance computing company Applied Digital, cloud services company Nebius Group, and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals. (Nvidia also recently purchased a 4% stake in Intel for $5 billion. Like Arm, Intel makes chips that in some cases are alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, but which for the most part are complementary to them.)\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia also pledged to invest £2 billion ($2.7 billion) in U.K. AI startups, including at least £500 million in Nscale, a U.K.-based data center operator that will, presumably, be using some of that money to purchase Nvidia GPUs to provision the data centers it is building. Nvidia also said it would invest in a number of British startups, both directly and through local venture capital firms, and some of that money too, will likely come back to OpenAI in the form of computing purchases, either directly, or through cloud service providers, who in turn will need to buy Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia invested about $1 billion in AI startups globally either directly or through its corporate venture capital arm NVentures, according to data from Dealroom and The Financial Times. This amount was up significantly from what Nvidia invested in 2022, the year the generative AI boom kicked off with OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nHow much of this money winds up coming right back to Nvidia in the form of sales is again, difficult to determine. Wall Street research firm NewStreet Research has estimated that for every $10 billion Nvidia invests in OpenAI, it will see $35 billion worth of GPU purchases or GPU lease payments, an amount equal to about 27% of its annual revenues last fiscal year.\n\nEchoes of the dotcom era\n\nThat kind of return would certainly make this sort of customer financing worthwhile. But it does raise concerns among analysts about a bubble in AI valuations. These kinds of circular deals have been a hallmark of previous technology bubbles and have often come back to haunt investors.\n\nIn this case, the lease arrangements that Nvidia is entering into with OpenAI as part of its latest investment could prove problematic. By leasing GPUs to OpenAI, rather than requiring them to buy the chips outright, Nvidia is sparing OpenAI from having to take an accounting charge for the high depreciation rates on the chips, which will ultimately help OpenAI’s bottom line. But it means that instead Nvidia will have to bear this depreciation costs. What’s more, Nvidia will also take on the risk of being stuck with an inventory of GPUs no one wants if demand for AI workloads don’t match Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rosy predictions.\n\n\n\nTo some market watchers, Nvidia’s latest deals feel all-too-similar to the excesses of past technology booms. During the dot com bubble at the turn of the 21st Century, telecom equipment makers such as Nortel, Lucent, and Cisco lent money to startups and telecom companies to purchase their equipment. Just before the bubble burst in 2001, the amount of financing Cisco and Nortel had extended to their customers exceeded 10% of annual revenues, and the amount of financing the top five telecom equipment makers had provided to customers exceeded 123% of their combined earnings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the amount of fiber-optic cabling and switching equipment installed far exceeded demand, and when the bubble burst and many of those customers went bust, the telecom equipment makers were left holding the bad debt on their balance sheets. This contributed to a greater loss of value when the bubble burst than would have otherwise been the case, with networking equipment businesses losing more than 90% of their value over the ensuing decade.\n\n\n\nWorse yet were companies such as fiber-optic giant Global Crossing that engaged in direct “revenue roundtripping.” These companies cut deals—often at the end of a quarter in order to hit topline forecasts—in which they paid money to another company for services, and then that company agreed to purchase equipment of exactly equal value. When the bubble burst, Global Crossing went bankrupt, and its executives ultimately paid large legal settlements related to revenue roundtripping.\n\n\n\nIt is memories of these kinds of transactions that have caused analysts to at least raise an eyebrow at some of Nvidia’s circular investments. Goldberg, the Seaport Global analyst, said the deals had a whiff of circular financing and were emblematic of “bubble-like behavior.”\n\n“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note following Nvidia’s announcement of its blockbuster investment in OpenAI. It’s a long way from a concern to a crisis, of course, but as AI company valuations get higher, that distance is starting to close.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "content": "The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i is the premium, feature-packed 16-inch powerhouse for those who need to work, create, and even game on the go. It's an excellent, incredibly practical laptop that feels like the more reasonable alternative to the divisive Dell 16 Premium (previously the Dell XPS 16). I only wish battery life was better, but I can't say I'm shocked it's not.\n\nWhy you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nCreators, engineers, and other professionals the world over rely on powerful 16-inch laptops to keep them working smoothly, even while staying mobile. The Dell XPS 16 (now the Dell 16 Premium), the Apple MacBook Pro 16, the Razer Blade 16 — these are all great choices, but there's another excellent alternative on the block.\n\nThis is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition... which is a ridiculously long name for an incredibly capable laptop with a practical design, potent performance, and an impressive set of features that make it well-suited to almost any task.\n\nIt's also well priced compared to the aforementioned competition, making it one of the easiest to recommend. While other laptops often focus on sleek and minimalist designs (often at the expense of features or practicality), the Yoga Pro 9i doesn't cut any corners — or ports.\n\nDisclaimer This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. Lenovo had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.\n\nMy Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) review\n\nImage 1 of 4 The clean Lenovo logo and \"communications bar\" are in full display with this laptop. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Most people would be content with just the ports on one side. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) I'd prefer swapping one of those Type-A ports for a Thunderbolt 4 port on the other side, but this is a great I/O selection either way. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) These aren't the slimmest bezels on the block, but the Yoga Pro 9i still feels plenty premium. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDesign ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWhere the Dell 16 Premium (2025) we recently reviewed boasts a controversial, futuristic, and minimalist design, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i absolutely prioritizes function over form.\n\nIt's a familiar two-tier Lenovo design with a rounded base and squared-off lid, creating a unique profile entirely constructed of high-quality aluminum. The Yoga Pro 9i isn't the most refined high-end laptop I've held in my hand and doesn't feature the slimmest display bezel, but it absolutely looks and feels like a premium product.\n\nYou can immediately tell the Yoga Pro 9i is a truly premium laptop, even if it's not the most futuristic design.\n\nAt around 17.9mm thick and 1.93kg heavy, there are certainly beefier 16-inch workstations, but the Yoga Pro 9i's design does make it seem chunkier than it actually is.\n\nAt least you get a ton of ports. There's the 170W DC power port, an HDMI 2.1 port, two full-featured Thunderbolt 4 ports with Power Delivery and DisplayPort functions, a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB Type-A (5GBps) ports, a side-mounted power button, a webcam privacy shutter, and even a full-sized SD card slot. The only things missing are an Ethernet port (Lenovo would've had to make this laptop a fair bit thicker for that) and a Kensington Nano Security Slot, which may actually disappoint some professional users.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDisplay ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nLenovo actually offers two OLED, touchscreen PureSight Pro display options for the Yoga Pro 9i. Both panels boast a 120Hz refresh rate, excellent color accuracy across standard and cinematic gamuts, Dolby Vision HDR and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 1000 support, and the trifecta of TÜV Rheindland Low Blue Light, TÜV Rheinland Flicker-Free, and Eyesafe certifications.\n\nFor an extra $150, though, you can upgrade to a Tandem OLED display with a higher 3.2K resolution (up from 2.8K), even greater color accuracy (especially in the AdobeRGB gamut), twice the display brightness at up to 1,000 nits (compared to 500 nits, and that's not even with HDR enabled), and greater efficiency to boot. Sadly, Lenovo didn't send me that configuration to test, so I can't tell you just how much better that panel is.\n\nThe entry-level screen is still fantastic, though. It's bright, vibrant, and responsive whether I was working, editing photos, gaming, or watching videos. If the Tandem OLED display is even better, it'll be one of the best panels you'll find on a laptop right now.\n\nPerformance ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, a 16-core CPU with fantastic overall performance and solid efficiency. That's backed by up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 (8GB) GPU, but Lenovo sent me the entry-level configuration with an RTX 5050 inside — and it seriously impressed me.\n\nThis laptop is a strong performer in general, backed by Intel Evo guarantees for responsiveness and bolstered by excellent thermal management. The Yoga Pro 9i never got too warm, never suffered from abnormal throttling, and kept quiet enough even under load.\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i was practically guaranteed to deliver great performance, but it still managed to surprise me.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, it's the RTX 5050 that surprised me. Lenovo actually offers a GPU overclocking option, and when enabled the Yoga Pro 9i's RTX 5050 performed well beyond the level I expected, coming within a stone's throw of the far more expensive Dell 16 Premium's RTX 5070 without becoming thermally restrained.\n\nI was able to play Forza Horizon 5 with Extreme settings without any issues, either, never dipping below a stable 60 FPS.\n\nImage 1 of 3 I really like this keyboard, but I'm still not a fan of Lenovo's next key coating. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) There's a lot of power packed into this chassis, but you don't feel it most of the time. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Intel Evo, NVIDIA Studio — this laptop has all the ingredients it needs to tackle any workflow or task. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nBattery life ⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWith an 84Whr battery stashed away inside, the Yoga Pro 9i certainly has plenty of juice... but it's not enough to translate to true all-day battery life. In my testing, the Yoga Pro 9i can deliver around 5 hours of real-time usage — slightly better than the Dell 16 Premium and its larger 99Whr battery, but nothing too impressive.\n\nYou can use up to 100W USB Type-C chargers whenever you're in a pinch, at least. Performance when off the charger is throttled, but is still absolutely what I'd consider \"flagship\" level — especially the graphical oomph.\n\nThis laptop can't claim to boast the greatest endurance, but it's no worse than much of the competition.\n\nKeyboard & touchpad ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI've historically been a huge fan of Lenovo's keyboards, and that still mostly holds true with the Yoga Pro 9i. The layout, key travel, and consistency are all top-notch, and the keyboard doesn't feel too cramped despite having a compact tenkey number pad off to one side (a feature some will love, and others will hate).\n\nAs I noted in my Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i (Gen 9) Aura Edition review, though, the new coating Lenovo puts on its keys isn't my favorite. This is a good keyboard, it's just slippery.\n\nThe touchpad is spacious and responsive with Microsoft Precision drivers, so I have little to complain about there... but I do wish Lenovo would finally embrace haptic touchpads on its premium consumer laptops.\n\nLenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding doesn't mean anything to 99% of people... this laptop still delivers a great software experience, though. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nSoftware & AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i runs Windows 11, and it does so without issue. Drivers are stable and Lenovo hasn't injected an absurd amount of bloatware onto the device.\n\nLenovo didn't pour every feature imaginable into the Yoga Pro 9i, it just focused on delivering a capable, high-quality laptop.\n\nYou also get some extra features courtesy of Lenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding, such as multi-device syncing for photos and files, \"smart\" performance and settings profiles, and Lenovo's \"AI Now\" companion, but the Yoga Pro 9i is not a Copilot+ PC thanks to the weaker NPU of its processor, so it doesn't boast all the latest and greatest artificial intelligence features in Windows.\n\nThat won't make a difference to most people, but it's worth noting this laptop technically isn't on the cutting edge for software.\n\nEverything else ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe display isn't the only reason the Yoga Pro 9i is a monster for entertainment, as it also packs a capable six-speaker system (dual 2W tweeters and quad 2W woofers) with Dolby Atmos support.\n\nI won't go as far as claiming these are the best-sounding speakers in a laptop I've heard, but the Yoga Pro 9i does sound full, loud, and clear. You also get a quad microphone array flanking the great 5MP front-facing camera, which is supported by an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition.\n\nI never had any issues with the Wi-Fi 7 or Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, either. The Yoga Pro 9i doesn't rock any additional features like Human Presence Detection (HPD) or ambient light sensors, or a fingerprint reader, but the basics are covered and they're covered well.\n\nYoga Pro 9i (Gen 10) review: My final thoughts\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i isn't one of the most exciting laptops of 2025, but it is one of my favorites. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\n✅You should buy this if ...\n\nYou need a powerful, feature-packed 16-inch laptop for work and creation.\n\nYou also want that laptop to be good for PC gaming, too.\n\nYou want a laptop with a top-notch OLED display and speaker system.\n\n❌You should not buy this if ...\n\nYou actually care about Windows 11's Copilot+ PC-exclusive features.\n\nYou need a laptop with consistent, easy all-day battery life.\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition may have a slightly ridiculous name, but it's hands-down one of the greatest laptops in the category of \"powerful and premium 16-inch workstations.\"\n\nWhile Apple commits to minimalism and Dell pushes even more aggressively in that direction, Lenovo is delivering an equally capable laptop packed with features and ports — all while undercutting the competition on price. It's a shockingly practical laptop for productivity, creation, entertainment, and gaming.\n\nWhile I do wish the battery could withstand a full day's worth of work without compromise, that doesn't stop this from being one of the best Windows laptops I've tested this year. You can customize your own Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition from $1,869.99 at Lenovo.com, or pull the trigger on the configuration I most recommend for $2,149.99 at Lenovo.com, which upgrades you to that sweet Tandem OLED display and a more powerful RTX 5060 GPU.",

      "content": "Adding to the list of pull requests submitted early in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window opening are several cryptography-related improvements. In particular, some nice performance optimizations once again for the Linux kernel.Google engineer Eric Biggers continues leading some very nice performance improvements in the cryptography space for the Linux kernel.First up is a pull request adding interleaved SHA-256 hashing support . This 2-way interleaved SHA-256 hashing is immediately used by the FS-VERITY module for faster file data verification. In turn it's been observed that FS-VERITY performance improves nicely across many Intel/AMD x86_64 and AArch64 processors. Eric Biggers reported in the patch that it's roughly 35% faster performance.\n\nAlso sent in was the FSCRYPT pull request for Linux 6.18. The focus there is on using HMAC-SHA512 library functions rather than going through crypto_shash. In turn FSCRYPT should enjoy this simpler and faster and more reliable code path.Lastly there was a pull request sent out on Saturday for crypto library updates . This pull brings RISC-V optimized code for Poly1305, simplifies other code, and always enabling architecture-optimized BLAKE2s code.",

      "headline": "RUMOR: SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY Will See The Punisher In Direct Conflict With The Villainous [SPOILER]",
      "content": "Spider-Man: Brand New Day is going to see Peter Parker face perhaps his greatest challenge yet. No longer an Avenger, the street-level superhero will have to contend with fellow \"hero\" The Punisher's war on crime, and new threats in The Scorpion and Tombstone.\n\nThe Hulk is also expected to enter the fray, while recent rumours have pointed to the supernatural Shathra being the movie's big bad.\n\nMinor plot details have come our way in dribs and drabs in recent weeks, with the latest shared by scooper Daniel Richtman. He claims that, in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, \"[The] Punisher and Tombstone will be in direct conflict.\"\n\nIf The Punisher has set his sights on him, then this points to Tombstone being a major threat in the movie. Assuming Mayor Wilson Fisk is defeated and imprisoned in Daredevil: Born Again season 2, then it's likely that the power vacuum in New York will lead to a Gang War that Spider-Man and Frank Castle attempt to put an end to.\n\nThis may also go some way in explaining what leads Frank to seemingly go to war with Ma Gnucci in the upcoming Punisher Special Presentation.\n\nRecent set photos have confirmed that the Department of Damage Control will appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, following appearances in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Ms. Marvel.\n\nHowever, before this movie is released, insider @MyTimeToShineH says we'll see the government organisation play a \"huge role\" in December's Wonder Man TV series.\n\nWe're not shocked to learn there's a connection between that and Spider-Man: Brand New Day because filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton has obviously worked on both projects.\n\nRecently, Marvel's Head of Streaming, Television, and Animation, Brad Winderbaum, said, \"Wonder Man is eight episodes. It's a very new flavor for Marvel. It's straight from the minds of Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Guest. Honestly, it is one of my favorite things ever.\"\n\n\"I think it's the best show no one's ever seen, and I’m very excited to see the audience reaction to it,\" the executive teased. \"I think it's a love letter to what we do as filmmakers. It's a love letter to acting as a profession, and it's a very sincere, beautiful show.\"\n\nAs always, let us know your thoughts on these MCU rumours down in the comments section.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day shares a title with a divisive era of storytelling, which, thanks to a deal with Mephisto, saw the wall-crawler get a fresh start when his marriage to Mary Jane Watson ended and his identity became secret again. He faced many new sinister foes during that time and was surrounded by an overhauled supporting cast, including Mister Negative, Jackpot, Menace, and Carlie Cooper.\n\nInstead, all signs point to Spidey teaming up with (and at some point fighting) The Punisher to take on a Savage Hulk, with The Scorpion thrown in for good measure.\n\nSeveral other villains are reportedly set to appear in the movie, including Tombstone, Tarantula, Boomerang, and Ramrod. There's been some chatter online about the Venom Symbiote factoring into the story, potentially setting the stage for Mac Gargan to eventually don the alien costume.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings helmer Destin Daniel Cretton directs Spider-Man: Brand New Day from a script by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland leads a cast that also includes Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, Zendaya, Sadie Sink, Michael Mando, Tramell Tillman, Marvin Jones III, and Liza Colón-Zayas. Thunderbolts* star Florence Pugh has also joined the cast.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day will be released in theaters on July 31, 2026.",

      "headline": "NEC V20: The Original PC Processor Upgrade",
      "content": "In the early 1980s, there was the IBM PC, with its 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 processor. It was an unexpected hit for the company, and within a few years there were a host of competitors. Every self-respecting technology corporation wanted a piece of the action including processor manufacturers, and among those was NEC with their V20 chip and its V30 sibling. From the outside they were faster pin-compatible 8088 and 8086 clones, but internally they could also run both 8080 and 80186 code. [The Silicon Underground] has a look back at the V20, with some technical details, history, and its place as a PC upgrade.\n\nFor such a capable part it’s always been a surprise here that it didn’t take the world by storm, and the article sheds some light on this in the form of an Intel lawsuit that denied it a critical early market access. By the time it was available in quantity the PC world had moved on from the 8088, so we saw it in relatively few machines. It was a popular upgrade for those in the know back in the day though as it remains in 2025, and aside from its immediate speed boost there are a few tricks it lends to a classic PC clone. The version of DOS that underpinned Windows 95 won’t run on an 8086 or 8088 because it contains 8016 instructions, but a V20 can run it resulting in a much faster DOS experience. One to remember, if an early PC or clone cones your way.\n\nHungry for the good old days of DOS? You don’t need to find 80s hardware for that.",

(Image credit: Xbox Game Studios / Windows Central) The list of Windows Central quizzes continues to grow. You might know your stuff when it comes to Call of Duty: Black Ops, but how will you fare against our other tests?\n\nBlack Ops is a series that has introduced drastic changes to the Call of Duty franchise over the years. In an era when many shooters embraced the brown and gray aesthetic, Black Ops dared to be a little brighter, featuring maps with bolder color palettes that are still among some of the best playgrounds even today.\n\nFrom the Siege of Stalingrad to Project Blackout, Black Ops’ history has taken us on mind-bending adventures across the annals of history that forge a twisted path to a future beyond imagination. And yet, Treyarch leadership says that Black Ops 7 will not bring the series to a close.\n\n“It can’t be [the end] for us because we have so much love for our other games,” answered Yale Miller, Treyarch’s director of production, “Like Black Ops 3 is canon, right? There are still things that are there [to explore].”\n\nWhile Black Ops’ deep lore and extensive campaigns provide plenty of fodder for future titles, so does its much-loved Zombies mode. Effectively a game-within-a-game, Zombies has grown into a beast of its own with its own canon story lines, unique cast, and nightmarish undead foes.\n\nTake our quiz below and test your Call of Duty: Black Ops knowledge:\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set to launch on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation on November 14. The next mainline title in the 20+ year old franchise is expected to be stacked with an all-new cooperative campaign and endgame. You can also look forward to classic multiplayer with a slightly more futuristic twist, and the next chapter in the Dark Aether storyline for its famed Zombies mode.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBlack Ops 7 is the first Call of Duty title to fall under the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, offering cross-entitlement to players on PC, Xbox, and Xbox Cloud Gaming with one purchase. The game will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.\n\nFor more intel on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, stay tuned for Call of Duty NEXT 2025 on September 30.",

      "timestamp": "2025-09-23",
      "content": "Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.\n\nThis announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.\n\nWhile an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.\n\nStill, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.\n\nNevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.\n\nEven though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The firm sees “early signs of improvement” for ASML.\n\n“Since peaking last year (Jul’24), earnings forecasts have been revised significantly downwards for ASML, as is typical in a downcycle, with a marked effect on the share price (down 45% peak to trough).”\n\nThe firm said its upgrade is a reflection of positive earnings revisions and cyclical recovery despite market concerns.\n\n“Our upgrade reflects the potential for positive earnings revisions and cyclical recovery – focus to shift to 2026-27 debate. FY27e EPS could approach €33 (8% ahead of consensus) on strength in memory, mix effects and cost controls. We expect order momentum to build before year-end 2025 for delivery in late 2026/27. Despite the recent rally, we think the share price still reflects flat layer count, weak China, and minimal sales from Intel and Samsung. We upgrade ASML to Overweight, with a PT of €950, implying 20% upside.”\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) develops and sells advanced semiconductor equipment, including lithography, metrology, and inspection systems for chip manufacturing.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "headline": "AMD Target Raised to $200 on AI Gains, CPU Momentum",
      "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials) won fresh support on Wall Street after Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating and set a $200 price target, pointing to continued growth in artificial intelligence chips and server CPUs. The target represents about 27% upside from current levels.\n\nArya said AMD's share gains in AI and data-center markets outweigh slower trends in cyclical businesses such as consoles and embedded chips. The company's accelerated roadmap includes the MI325X entering mass production this year and the MI350 coming later in 2025, followed by a new AI server platform in 2026.\n\nThe call comes as investors digest Nvidia's $5 billion investment and product pact with Intel, a move seen as strengthening competition in data-center and PC processors. Arya argued the deal could actually benefit AMD, since both companies rely on the x86 ecosystem that AMD also licenses, making the market more robust overall.\n\nAMD stock is up more than 30% this year, though it has been volatile, trading between $76 and $187 over the past 12 months. Analysts hold a Moderate Buy consensus on the stock, with an average target of $188.",

      "headline": "Obsidian governs AI agent access in SaaS environments",
      "content": "Obsidian Security has launched a SaaS AI agent defense, providing enterprises with a purpose-built solution to govern how AI agents access data in SaaS environments.\n\nWith SaaS now one of the most targeted layers of the enterprise stack, Obsidian is closing the enterprise AI agent-to-SaaS blindspot, where unmanaged agentic AI integrations and excessive privileges can create cascading risk.\n\nIn the recent Salesforce attack (UNC6040), threat actors used voice phishing campaigns to obtain initial access and run bulk API queries for large-scale data theft and extortion. The Salesloft Salesforce supply chain breach (UNC6395) illustrated the fragility of SaaS-to-SaaS integrations where one compromised chatbot integration expanded into unauthorized access across Salesforce and downstream applications, including Google Workspace, Slack, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure and other services at hundreds of enterprises.\n\nThe rise of AI agents and its adoption further escalates the SaaS security challenge. Low-code and no-code platforms like Microsoft Copilot Studio, ChatGPT Enterprise, Salesforce Agentforce and n8n let any employee build and deploy agents that act inside SaaS applications, chaining tasks, querying data, and executing decisions autonomously without oversight.\n\nThese agents often carry broad privileges, long-lasting tokens and move sensitive business data at machine speed. If compromised, they can leak data, escalate access and move laterally across connected SaaS applications, causing widespread damage.\n\n“The AI agent shift is well underway, and we’re seeing the risks firsthand as we help our customers scale adoption securely,” said Hasan Imam, CEO at Obsidian. “87% of enterprises have Microsoft Copilot enabled, more than half the agents access sensitive data, 90% are over-permissioned, and move 16 times more data than humans accessing SaaS applications. These risks are not theoretical, they’re active risks inside enterprises today, often without their awareness.”\n\nSecurity tools lack visibility into machine-driven activity, cannot contextualize underlying privileges and are unable to enforce controls at the speed and scale of autonomous agents.\n\n“The difference between a major intrusion and successful containment comes down to speed,” said Sunil Seshadri, EVP and CSO at HealthEquity. “Most security teams already struggle to react to incidents fast enough and AI agents raise the stakes even higher. They can trigger workflows across multiple SaaS apps in seconds, often without anyone noticing until damage is done. Obsidian flips that dynamic by detecting issues in near real-time, faster than most security tools are able to, giving teams the chance to shut them down before they spiral out of control.”\n\nProtecting SaaS environments from AI agent risks\n\nObsidian is uniquely positioned to address the security risks created by autonomous AI agents in SaaS environments. At its core is the SaaS threat dataset repository, over 500 curated real-world threat intelligence, enriched with browser-based activity capture and deep SaaS and AI integrations.\n\nThis intelligence powers the Obsidian Knowledge Graph, a continuously learning model that unifies user and agent activity, identity privileges, and workflows across SaaS and SaaS managed agentic AI platforms into a single correlated view. This live map gives security teams real-time visibility and context to govern agentic AI usage and stop unauthorized agents and behavior inside SaaS environments, where risks emerge and propagate.\n\n“In customer deployments, our continuously learning Knowledge Graph revealed that AI agents in SaaS environments were typically granted ten times more permissions than needed when mapped against real user privileges and entitlements, visibility only Obsidian can deliver,” said Khanh Tran, CPO at Obsidian. “By connecting popular AI platforms like Microsoft Copilot Studio, n8n, Salesforce Agentforce, and ChatGPT Enterprise with the Obsidian Knowledge Graph, security teams can finally see what agents are doing in SaaS. That intel means they can stop risks before they spread and empower users to innovate faster without sacrificing security or governance.”\n\nThis product release is enabling enterprises securely scale AI agent development. Key capabilities in the latest release include:",

      "content": "Intel's higher-end Arc GPUs—whether the current Xe2 \"Battlemage\" or the previous Xe \"Alchemist\"—typically arrive later, as the new Arc product family launches with lower-end and mid-range SKUs first. This has historically created rumors that Intel is retreating from the higher-end play, much like AMD did with its current RDNA 4 portfolio. However, Intel's newest job listing suggests that these rumors couldn't be further from the truth, as Intel is now hiring more engineers to work on these high-end GPUs. The job listing notes: \"In this role, you will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technology, and you will be responsible for optimizing and validating the Gaming performance of our High-end Desktop System-on-Chip (SoC) designs focusing on dGFX Gaming performance.\" The focus here lies on gaming high-end dGFX SoCs, which are actually higher-end discrete GPUs.Additionally, the company spokesperson recently confirmed that \"Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings,\" despite NVIDIA's $5 billion investment . This has given current and potential future users of Arc a good indication that Intel will continue to invest in its GPU platform for gamers. As a reminder, Intel currently ships Arc \"Battlemage\" GPU generation, with the higher-end Arc B770 reportedly planned for the holiday season. The company plans to use a part of its Xe3 \"Celestial\" for graphics rendering and Xe4 \"Druid\" for media and display duties in its upcoming \"Nova Lake\" SoCs scheduled for 2026. We are yet to see if Intel's upcoming high-end GPUs are a match for current and next-generation offerings from AMD and NVIDIA.",

      "headline": "'Hybrid creep' is spreading as more companies tighten RTO rules",
      "content": "A number of high-profile companies have announced they will require more days of in-office work.\n\nA number of high-profile companies have announced they will require more days of in-office work. Bo Zaunders/Getty Images\n\nA number of high-profile companies have announced they will require more days of in-office work. Bo Zaunders/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nSorry, home-office enthusiasts. So-called \"hybrid creep\" is gaining traction.\n\nEmployers are gradually increasing the number of days that workers must show up at the office. For example, this month Intel began requiring staffers to come in at least four days a week, up from three previously. NBCUniversal, Starbucks, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. recently implemented similar mandates.\n\nA new survey of 2,000 full-time US workers found that nearly a third of employers revised their remote or hybrid work policies in the past year. Video-conferencing company Owl Labs, which commissioned the poll and claims it came up with the term \"hybrid creep,\" found that 34% of respondents are now required to be on-site at least four days a week. That is up from 32% in 2024 and 23% in 2023.\n\n\"This is the boiling-frog concept,\" Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Boston-based Owl Labs, told Business Insider. Instead of suddenly demanding workers return to the office full-time after several years of hybrid — and before that, fully remote — schedules, they've been taking things slow, he said.\n\nIt's likely that employers going with a baby-step approach aren't using stricter return-to-office mandates as a way to nudge workers to resign, said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\n\"Nobody's quitting now anyway,\" he said.\n\nInstead, companies may be easing staff back into commuting incrementally to avoid stirring resentment, which can hamper productivity. Just because workers aren't handing in resignations as frequently as they used to doesn't mean they're happy with less flexibility, Cappelli said.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nCompanies generally want workers back at the office so they can monitor them more closely and spur more collaboration. Yet five-day RTO mandates have come with some hiccups, as Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAmazon's shift in January from three to five mandatory office days left workers scrambling for desks and meeting rooms, while Dell's March orders for employees living near an office to come back full time resulted in uneven compliance. Some workers at the tech company resumed eight-hour office days, while \"coffee badgers\" showed up only briefly.\n\nStill, returning to a fully in-person workweek may result in some employees resigning, even in today's job-hugging economy, because of child- or elder-care needs, said Pace University management professor Andrew Coggins.\n\nReturning to fully in-person schedules \"can be a big jump,\" he said.\n\nOwl Labs's survey suggests that more workers are warming up to office life. Some 21% of respondents said they'd like to be on-site as many as four days a week, an increase from 17% in last year's report. Yet nearly half of workers polled said they still lack the overall work flexibility they want, and 37% said they'd decline a job offer from a company that doesn't allow flexible working hours.\n\nIt's possible that hybrid creep is a sign that the era of flexible work is coming to an end — at least at some companies. \"I think employers would prefer five days,\" said Coggins. \"They have more control.\"",

The declines marked a reversal from the indexes' earlier gains.\n\nDebate over the prospects for US interest rate cuts — the big focus for markets right now — appeared to pressure stocks. Comments from Federal Reserve officials this week have hinted at growing disagreement on what the path of policy should be, given cracks showing in the labor market.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in a speech on Tuesday that the central bank would proceed cautiously on further rate cuts, even as he left the door open to more easing. He also described stocks as \"fairly highly valued.\"\n\nWall Street is now counting down to the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, on Friday. Markets are watching for reassurance that inflation isn't posing a threat to high expectations for two more rate cuts this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, fresh data from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed new home sales unexpectedly surged in August as mortgage rates began to ease, bringing homebuyers off the sidelines and releasing pent-up demand. Still, affordability concerns persist.\n\nMeanwhile, some tech stocks are showing gains despite a broader drop across the Nasdaq, which snapped a winning streak on Tuesday amid losses for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks.\n\nAlibaba stock (BABA) jumped 8% as investors welcomed the Chinese tech giant's pledge to hike its AI spending beyond its original $50 billion target. The boost is needed for Alibaba to keep pace as global investment in AI surges to $4 trillion, its CEO said.\n\nTesla (TSLA) shares climbed 4% and were on track to close at their highest level in 2025 as analysts at investing firm Mizuho Securities lifted their price outlook on the stock to $450. The analysts noted the EV maker is seeing only a \"muted\" impact from tariffs and boosted optimism for the company's robotaxi ambitions.\n\nAt the same time, Micron's (MU) stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings delivered a positive signal for the AI trade, though shares in the memory chipmaker — which supplies semiconductors for Nvidia's (NVDA) AI systems — fell on Wednesday.\n\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER\n\n25 updates",

      "headline": "Analysis: Dell Technologies, Inc. announces Q2 FY2026 financial results",
      "content": "Dell Technologies, Inc. has announced financial results for the second quarter of FY2026 (ending 1st August 2025). Revenue rose 19.0% year-on-year to $29.8 billion for the quarter, a record for the company. The improvement was driven by a massive rise in server revenue year-on-year of 68.7%. However, other parts of the business appear to be languishing behind the drive to sell more GPU-based servers.\n\nBackground\n\nDell Technologies, Inc. declared financial results for Q2 FY2026, the period ending 1st August 2025, on 28th August 2025. Total revenue rose by 19.0% to $29.8 billion. Product sales (as compared to Services) now account for 80.4% of revenue.\n\nWe present the data in eight graphs, labelled Figure 1 to 8.\n\nFigure 1 – Dell Quarterly P&L Figure 2 – Dell Quarterly Financials\n\nBox Shifting\n\nFigure 8 dramatically demonstrates the rise in server sales. We can see a spike upwards in the ISG – Servers & Networking segment revenue of 68.7%, year-on-year, to approximately $12.9 billion, or 43.5% of all revenue generated in the quarter.\n\nThere was a time when Dell made most of its revenue from PC sales. That is no longer the case in the AI-driven world. The CSG – Consumer segment declined another 7.3% year-on-year, while CSG – Commercial rose by only 2.1%. Elsewhere, ISG – Storage declined by 3.0%, year-on-year.\n\nDell is the classic box-shifting business, with Servers & Networking achieving only a 12.1% margin in the current quarter. In contrast, that segment has reached peaks of over 20% in the past.\n\nFigure 3 – Dell Operating Income as % of Revenue Figure 4 – Dell Quarterly Gross Margin\n\nMargin Impact\n\nShould we care about the level of gross margin, when, as shown in Figure 4, the historical trend over the last three years has been 20-25%? Margin is used to fund sales, marketing, admin and research/development. As shown in Figure 6, Dell currently spends approximately 3% on R&D, whereas historically that figure was between 5% and 6%. We’ve shown absolute numbers too, to highlight that spending has declined in relative and absolute terms, not as a function of increased revenue.\n\nInvestment\n\nIn our analysis, we focus on Dell from a data storage perspective, so direct comparisons are difficult to make, but we can look at overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue compared to Pure Storage (28% in Q1 FY2026) and NetApp, Inc. (16% in Q1 FY2026). Even if we assumed that all Dell R&D funded the storage business, that would translate to just 20% of ISG – Storage revenue, still below Pure Storage.\n\nPurely in the storage business, we believe Dell Technologies is significantly underinvesting in research & development. The flagship PowerStore platform, for example, still uses generation 2 hardware-based Intel Cascade Lake processors first introduced in 2022. The last hardware update was the introduction of QLC NAND into one model of product in May 2024. This solution uses QLC drives of only 15.36TB capacity.\n\nFigure 5 – Dell Quarterly Revenue by BU Stacked Figure 6 – Dell Quarterly R&D Spend\n\nElsewhere in the industry, Pure Storage has already delivered 150TB DFMs (effectively internally developed SSDs), with 300TB expected in 2026. NetApp supports 30.7TB drives in the higher-end solutions, with larger capacity drives on the horizon for Insight 2025.\n\nInnovation\n\nOf course, hardware capability is only one aspect of modern storage delivery. Customers want a cloud-like experience over the lifetime of their storage platforms deployed on-premises. Both Pure Storage and NetApp have better public cloud solutions than Dell. Both companies also offer a better experience than Dell for on-premises deployment and management.\n\nFigure 7 – Dell Quarterly Revenue Figure 8 – Dell Quarterly Revenue by BU\n\nThe Architect’s View®\n\nBy virtue of its acquisition of EMC Corporation, Dell Technologies still holds the #1 place for storage revenue. Both HPE and IBM no longer itemise storage revenue data, but in comparison to Pure Storage or NetApp, these companies in the current quarter represent only 22% and 40% of Dell’s storage revenue, respectively.\n\nThat leading position enables Dell to be relatively complacent about recurring business with their customers. However, it is worth noting that since Dell acquired EMC, its storage business has flatlined at around $4 billion per quarter in revenue, excluding any changes for inflation.\n\nWe are not a business or investment company but are instead focused on technology. When we perform a detailed analysis of the features and functionality of PowerStore and other Dell storage solutions, we see offerings that lag well behind the competition.\n\nHowever, data storage is a “sticky” business. Changing vendors involves data migrations, new processes and procedures and new standards for every aspect of the IT function. Businesses don’t change vendors lightly. Instead, what we are seeing is the gradual attrition of Dell’s storage business, as growth in the market goes elsewhere (to competitors and the public cloud).\n\nIn the long term, Dell Technologies may not care that this process occurs. After all, little will probably change in the next decade, by which time the EMC acquisition will have paid for itself. But, from the customer perspective, it is clear there are better products and solutions available from companies we’ve highlighted here – and many more.\n\nAt some point in the near future, the revenue from GPU-based servers will end. What happens then? The historical strategy of infrastructure vendors acquiring storage companies is arguably over. Dell (or HPE for that matter) are unlikely to buy another storage start-up to replace their existing technology. HPE has also just digested another networking company and sees greater gains there.\n\nThe post-AI boom could be difficult for Dell, as businesses look for efficiencies following the AI spending over-exuberance. We don’t believe Dell, or its customers are positioned to gain from this downturn, unless a significant change in strategy is adopted.\n\nPost #536c. Copyright (c) 2025 Brookend Ltd.

      "headline": "How Major SOCs Achieve Early Threat Detection in 3 Steps",
      "content": "Every SOC leader understands that faster threat detection is better. But the difference between knowing it and building a system that consistently achieves it is massive. The best Security Operations Centers (SOCs) have already proven that early detection is the deciding factor between a minor alert and a full-blown breach. Yet many SOCs still struggle to make their detection processes fast, precise, and actionable.\n\nLet’s break down why early threat detection matters so much, what leading SOCs are doing right, and how you can follow their path in three steps.\n\nWhy Early Threat Detection Is Crucial\n\nAt first glance, “detecting earlier” sounds obvious. But in practice, it defines the resilience of the entire organisation. Five reasons stand out:\n\nReduced Damage Costs – Every minute a threat goes undetected increases potential losses. Stopping ransomware before encryption, for example, saves millions. IBM reports that early detection can slash breach expenses by 30-50%.\n\n– Every minute a threat goes undetected increases potential losses. Stopping ransomware before encryption, for example, saves millions. IBM reports that early detection can slash breach expenses by 30-50%. Faster Incident Response – Analysts can act in real time rather than chasing after an adversary that’s already three steps ahead. Ransomware groups can achieve full domain compromise within hours, not days. Nation-state actors establish persistence and begin data exfiltration within 24-48 hours of initial access.\n\n– Analysts can act in real time rather than chasing after an adversary that’s already three steps ahead. Ransomware groups can achieve full domain compromise within hours, not days. Nation-state actors establish persistence and begin data exfiltration within 24-48 hours of initial access. Countering Advanced Threats – APTs and living-off-the-land techniques are designed to remain hidden. Early spotting makes persistence almost impossible. Early intel lets you block AI and zero-days before they scale across your network.\n\n– APTs and living-off-the-land techniques are designed to remain hidden. Early spotting makes persistence almost impossible. Early intel lets you block AI and zero-days before they scale across your network. Business Continuity – Depends on containment speed. The faster you detect threats, the smaller the containment perimeter needs to be. Early detection often means the difference between taking a single server offline and shutting down entire business units.\n\n– Depends on containment speed. The faster you detect threats, the smaller the containment perimeter needs to be. Early detection often means the difference between taking a single server offline and shutting down entire business units. Regulatory & Reputational Protection – Faster detection helps avoid compliance violations and public breaches that damage trust. Late detection doesn’t just cost money; it creates legal liability.\n\nIn other words, early detection isn’t just a metric: it’s the backbone of organisational defence. It supports revenue by preventing disruptions. Top SOCs tie it to KPIs like uptime and risk scores, proving ROI to the C-suite.\n\nStep 1: Assess and Improve What You Have\n\nBefore building new capabilities, maximise what you already have. Most SOCs can achieve 30-40% faster detection times by optimising existing tools and processes.\n\nStreamline Alert Triage – Ensure analysts don’t waste time on low-value alerts. Enrich them with contextual threat intel right away.\n\n\n\nStart with your alert-to-incident ratio. If your analysts are investigating more than 20-30 alerts to find one real threat, you have a signal-to-noise problem that’s slowing everything down.\n\nOptimise Your Threat Intelligence Integration – Many SOCs have threat intelligence\n\nSet up IOC blocking at perimeter devices and real-time TI enrichment for security alerts. Create custom detection rules based on recent threat campaigns.\n\n\n\nAutomate Repetitive Checks – Use playbooks and SOAR integrations to free human capacity for complex threats. Measure Detection Latency: track the time from threat entry to first alert. Without measuring it, you can’t improve it.\n\nStep 2: Building the Base\n\nHigh-performing SOCs share three foundational capabilities that set them apart:\n\nInteractive Malware Analysis – Instead of static scans, they use sandboxes like ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox, where analysts can interact with suspicious files and URLs to uncover hidden behaviour.\n\nAnalysts can interact with malware demanding user actions in the Sandbox\n\nContext-Rich Threat Intelligence – They don’t just collect IOCs; they maintain lookup and feed services that allow instant pivoting and enrichment. ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Lookup is a relevant solution to this task.\n\nCross-Team Collaboration – Detection isn’t siloed; SOC, IR, and threat hunting teams all have access to the same real-time insights.\n\nThese practices form the baseline for rapid, reliable early detection.\n\n\n\nRequest a demo for ANY.RUN products and lay the foundation for business resilience\n\n\n\nAnd here is what top SOC teams do daily:\n\nTune alerts with data-driven rules to cut noise.\n\nAutomate low-level tasks, freeing humans for complex analysis.\n\nConduct regular simulations (e.g., purple team exercises) to test detection speed.\n\nThis foundation turns reactive firefighting into predictive defence, with clients reporting MTTD dropping from days to hours.\n\nStep 3: Future-Proof Your Detection Capabilities\n\nThe cyber arms race favours the prepared. Hackers evolve weekly, so top SOCs stay ahead by embedding threat intel and AI into workflows. It’s about pace: detect tomorrow’s threats today.\n\nEmbrace AI-Assisted Detection (But Do It Right). Focus on reducing analyst workload, not replacing analysts.\n\nBuild Continuous Threat Hunting Capabilities. Proactive threat hunting finds threats that automated systems miss and generates intelligence that improves those systems.\n\nScale with Automation: Orchestrate responses (e.g., auto-isolate endpoints) while humans oversee escalations.\n\nHow ANY.RUN Accelerates These Steps\n\nNo framework is complete without the right equipment. ANY.RUN’s suite – Interactive Sandbox, TI Lookup, and TI Feeds is specifically designed to support each step, fueling detection for 15,000+ security teams worldwide.\n\nInteractive Sandbox in Steps 1 & 2: Upload suspicious files or URLs for real-time detonation in a safe VM. Interact like a user (type, drag files) to reveal hidden behaviours, IOCs, and TTPs in minutes, not hours. It cuts triage time by providing instant verdicts, helping you audit alerts faster and build accurate detection rules.\n\n\n\nDetonate a malware sample in the safe VM environment, emulate user actions, and observe the whole attack chain:\n\n\n\nView an analysis session of recently active malware\n\nWannaCry live in the Sandbox\n\nTI Lookup Across All Steps: Query a vast database of 1M+ daily IOCs from global investigations. Enrich alerts with context on malware families or APTs, prioritising threats early. Integrates via API with your SIEM/XDR for automated lookups, boosting Step 3’s predictive edge.\n\n\n\nOne lookup exposes an IP address as malicious, delivers additional IOCs, detects the malware they belong to, and links to sandbox analysis sessions:\n\ndestinationIP:”142.93.82.250″\n\nIOC quick verdict and context for further research\n\nTI Feeds for Future-Proofing: Get live feeds of IOAs/IOBs/IOCs from expert analyses. This enhances team hunting in Step 2 and scales intel in Step 3, creating a continuous improvement loop for your detection capabilities.\n\nANY.RUN’s TI Feeds key features and data sources\n\n\n\nTogether, they slash MTTD, reduce costs, and integrate seamlessly with no heavy lifts required.\n\nChallenges on the Path to Early Detection\n\nOf course, no transition is free from obstacles. SOC leaders should prepare for:\n\nData Overload – More intelligence means more noise. Prioritisation and automation are essential.\n\nSkill Gaps – Analysts may need training to use advanced tools like interactive sandboxes effectively.\n\nChange Resistance – Established processes are hard to break; leadership must drive cultural as well as technical change.\n\nBudget Constraints – Faster detection may require upfront investment, but the cost of breaches dwarfs these expenses.\n\nFacing these challenges head-on is part of building a SOC that truly delivers.\n\nConclusion: The Time for Early Detection is Now\n\nThe cybersecurity arms race isn’t slowing down: it’s accelerating. Every month that passes without improving your detection capabilities is a month your adversaries spend developing new ways to evade your current defences.\n\nThe three-step approach outlined here isn’t theoretical; it’s based on what the most successful SOCs are actually doing right now. They’re not waiting for perfect tools or unlimited budgets. They’re optimising what they have, building essential capabilities, and positioning themselves to stay ahead of evolving threats.\n\nThe question isn’t whether your organisation needs early threat detection. It’s whether you implement it before or after your next major security incident. The SOCs that answer “before” are the ones that will still be protecting their organisations effectively five years from now.",

      "headline": "Windows ML is Generally Available with Windows App SDK 1.8.1",
      "content": "Microsoft today announced the first stable release of Windows ML, its AI inferencing runtime for Windows 11. Windows ML (Windows Machine Learning) is optimized for inferencing on-device AI models, like those used by Copilot+ PCs, though it offers streamlined model dependency management across CPUs, GPUs and NPUs. It’s also the basis for the Windows AI Foundry, which was originally called the Windows Copilot Runtime.\n\n“The future of AI is hybrid, utilizing the respective strengths of cloud and client while harnessing every Windows device to achieve more,” Microsoft distinguished engineer Logan Iyer explains. “At Microsoft, we are reimagining what’s possible by bringing powerful AI compute directly to Windows devices, unlocking a new era of intelligence that runs where you are. With groundbreaking advancements in silicon, a modernized software stack and deep OS integration, Windows 11 is transforming into the world’s most open and capable platform for local AI.”\n\nMicrosoft first announced Windows ML (and the Windows AI Foundry) at Build 2025 this past May, so this is a pretty quick turnaround. (Compare this to the Windows Copilot Runtime, which was announced at Build 2024 and never shipped in stable.) With this release, developers can use Windows ML capabilities in production, and that tells me that there must be a new stable release of the Windows App SDK, the framework that developers use to access Windows ML. And there is: Windows App SDK 1.8.1 is now available with support for Windows 11 version 24H2 and newer. (You can download that here.)\n\nIn keeping with the nature of Windows itself, Windows ML acts as a hardware abstraction layer so that developers can target specific local AI capabilities without worrying about which hardware architectures or chipsets are available on the PCs on which their apps will run. Apps built with Windows ML will automatically download any necessary execution providers, so they don’t need to be bundled with specific (or multiple) runtimes. But developers can also create device policies to optimize their apps for low power (NPU) or high performance (GPU), or to specify the silicon used for a model.\n\n“Windows 11 has a diverse hardware ecosystem that includes AMD, Intel, NVIDIA and Qualcomm and spans the CPU, GPU and NPU. Consumers can choose from a range of Windows PCs and this variety empowers developers to create innovative local AI experiences,” Iyer continues. “Windows ML can fully leverage their latest CPUs, GPUs and NPUs for AI workloads … Leading software app developers such as Adobe, BUFFERZONE, Dot Inc., McAfee, Reincubate, Topaz Labs and Wondershare are among many others working on adopting Windows ML in their upcoming releases, accelerating the proliferation of local AI capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications.”\n\nYou can learn more about Windows ML on the Microsoft Learn website.",

      "headline": "The YouTube Tip of the Google Spear",
      "content": "Listen to this post: Log in to listen\n\nAction is happening up-and-down the LLM stack: Nvidia is making deals with Intel, OpenAI is making deals with Oracle, and Nvidia and OpenAI are making deals with each other. Nine years after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first Nvidia DGX-1 AI computer to OpenAI, the chip giant is investing up to $100 billion in the AI lab, which OpenAI will, of course, spend on Nvidia AI systems.\n\nThis ouroboros of a deal certainly does feel a bit frothy, but there is a certain logic to it: Nvidia is uniquely dominant in AI thanks to the company’s multi-year investment in not just superior chips but also an entire ecosystem from networking to software, and has the cash flow and stock price befitting its position in the AI value chain. Doing a deal like this at this point in time not only secures the company’s largest customer — and rumored ASIC maker — but also gives Nvidia equity upside beyond the number of chips it can manufacture. More broadly, lots of public investors would like the chance to invest in OpenAI; I don’t think Nvidia’s public market investors are bothered to have now acquired that stake indirectly.\n\nThe interconnectedness of these investments reflects the interconnectedness of the OpenAI and Nvidia stories in particular: Huang may have delivered OpenAI their first AI computer, but it was OpenAI that delivered Nvidia the catalyst for becoming the most valuable company in the world, with the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT. Ever since, the assumption of many in tech has been that the consumer market in particular has been OpenAI’s to lose, or perhaps more accurately, monetize; no company has ever grown faster in terms of users and revenue, and that’s before they had an advertising model!\n\nAnd beyond the numbers, have you used ChatGPT? It’s so useful. You can look up information, or format text, and best of all you can code! Of course there are other models like Anthropic’s Claude, which has excelled at coding in particular, but surely the sheer usefulness makes ultimate success inevitable!\n\nA Brief History of Social Media\n\nIf a lot of those takes sound familiar, it’s because I’ve made some version of most of them; I also, perhaps relatedly, took to Twitter like a fish to water. Just imagine, an app that was the nearly perfect mixture of content I was interested in and people I wanted to hear from, and interact with. Best of all it was text: the efficiency of information acquisition was unmatched, and it was just as easy to say my piece.\n\nIt took me much longer to warm up to Facebook, and, frankly, I never was much of a user; I’ve never been one to image dump episodes of my life, nor have I had much inclination to wade through others’. I wasn’t interested in party photos; I lusted after ideas and arguments, and Twitter — a view shared by much of both tech and media — was much more up my alley.\n\nDespite that personal predilection, however, and perhaps because of my background in small town Wisconsin and subsequently living abroad, I retained a strong sense of the importance of Facebook. Sure, the people who I was most interested in hearing from and interacting with may have been the types to leave their friends and family for the big city, but for most people, friends and family were the entire point of life generally, and by extension, social media specifically.\n\nTo that end, I was convinced from the beginning that Facebook was going to be a huge deal, and argued so multiple times on Stratechery; social media was ultimately a matter of network effects and scale, and Facebook was clearly on the path to domination, even as much of the Twitterati were convinced the company was the next MySpace. I was similarly bullish about Instagram: no, I wasn’t one to post a lot of personal pictures, but while I personally loved text, most people liked photos.\n\nWhat people really liked most of all, however — and not even Facebook saw this coming — was video. TikTok grew into a behemoth with the insight that social media was only ever a stepping stone to personal entertainment, of which video was the pinnacle. There were no network effects of the sort that everyone — including regulators — assumed would lead to eternal Facebook dominance; rather, TikTok realized that Paul Krugman’s infamous dismissal of the Internet actually was somewhat right: most people actually don’t have anything to say that is particularly compelling, which means that limiting the content you see to your social network dramatically decreases the possibility you’ll be entertained every time you open your social networking app. TikTok dispensed with this artificial limitation, simply showing you compelling videos period, no matter where they came from.\n\nThe Giant in Plain Sight\n\nOf course TikTok wasn’t the first company to figure this out: YouTube was the first video platform, and from the beginning focused on building an algorithm that focused more on giving you videos you were interested in than in showing you what you claimed to want to see.\n\nYouTube, however, was and probably always has been my biggest blind spot: I’m just not a big video watcher in general, and YouTube seemed like more work than short-form video, which married the most compelling medium with the most addictive delivery method — the feed. Sure, YouTube was a great acquisition for Google — certainly in line with the charge to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” — but I — and Google’s moneymaker, Search — was much more interested in text, and pictures if I must.\n\nThe truth, however, is that YouTube has long been the giant hiding in plain sight: the service is the number one streaming service in the living room — bigger than Netflix — and that’s the company’s 3rd screen after mobile and the PC, where it has no peer. More than that, YouTube is not just the center of culture, but the nurturer of it: the company just announced that it has paid out more than $100 billion to creators over the last four years; given that many creators earn more from brand deals than they do from YouTube ads, that actually understates the size of the YouTube economy. Yes, TikTok is a big deal, but TikTok stars hope to make it on YouTube, where they can actually make a living.\n\nAnd yet, YouTube sometimes seems like an afterthought, at least to people like me and others immersed in the text-based Internet. Last week I was in New York for YouTube’s annual “Made on YouTube” event, but the night before I couldn’t remember the name; I turned to Google, natch, and couldn’t figure it out. The reason is that talk about YouTube mostly happens on YouTube; I, and Google itself, still live in a text-based world.\n\nThat is the world that was rocked by ChatGPT, especially Google. The company’s February 2023 introduction of Bard in Paris remains one of the most surreal keynotes I’ve ever watched: most of the content was rehashed, the presenters talked as if they were seeing their slides for the first time, and one of the demos of a phone-based feature neglected to remember to have a phone on hand. This was a company facing a frontal assault on their most obvious and profitable area of dominance — text-based information retrieval — and they were completely flat-footed.\n\nGoogle has, in the intervening years, made tremendous strides to come back, including dumping the Bard name in favor of Gemini, itself based on vastly improved underlying models. I’m also impressed by how the company has incorporated AI into search; not only are AI Overviews generally useful, they’re also incredibly fast, and as a bonus have the links I sometimes prefer already at hand. Ironically, however, you could make the case that the biggest impact LLMs have had on Search is giving a federal judge an excuse to let Google continue paying its biggest would-be competitors (like Apple) to simply offer their customers Google instead. The biggest reason to be skeptical of the company’s fortunes in AI is that they had the most to lose; the company is doing an excellent job of minimizing the losses.\n\nWhat I would submit, however, is that Google’s most important and most compelling AI announcements actually don’t have anything to do with Search, at least not yet. These announcements start, as you might expect, with Google’s Deep Mind Research Lab; where they hit the real world, however, is on YouTube — and that, like the user-generated streaming service, is a really big deal.\n\nThe DeepMind-to-YouTube Pipeline\n\nA perfect example of the DeepMind-to-YouTube pipeline was last week’s announcement of Veo 3-based features for making YouTube Shorts. From the company’s blog post:\n\nWe’ve partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of their most powerful video generation model, Veo 3, to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast is designed to work seamlessly in YouTube Shorts for millions of creators and users, for free. It generates outputs with lower latency at 480p so you can easily create video clips – and for the first time, with sound – from any idea, all from your phone.\n\nThis initial launch will allow you to not only generate videos, but also use one video to animate another (or a photo), stylize your video with a single touch, and add objects. You can also create an entire video — complete with voiceover — from a collection of clips, or convert speech to song. All of these features are a bit silly, but, well, that’s often where genius — or at least virality — comes from.\n\nCritics, of course, will label this an AI slop machine, and they’ll be right! The vast majority of content created by these tools will be boring and unwatched. That, however, is already the case with YouTube: the service sees 500 hours of content uploaded every minute, and most of that content isn’t interesting to anyone; the magic of YouTube, however, is the algorithm that finds out what is actually compelling and spreads it to an audience that wants exactly that.\n\nTo put it another way, for YouTube AI slop is a strategy credit: given that the service has already mastered organizing overwhelming amounts of content and only surfacing what is good, it, more than anyone else, can handle exponentially more content which, through the sheer force of numbers, will result in an absolute increase of content that is actually compelling.\n\nThat’s not the only strategy credit YouTube has; while the cost of producing AI-generated video will likely be lower than the cost of producing human-generated video, at least in the long run, the latter’s costs are not borne by TikTok or Meta (Facebook and Instagram are basically video platforms at this point). Rather, the brilliance of the user-generated content model is that creators post their content for free! This, however, means that AI-generated video is actually more expensive, at least if it’s made on TikTok or Meta’s servers. YouTube, however, pays its creators, which means that for the service AI-generated video actually has the potential to lower costs in the long run, increasing the incentive to leverage DeepMind’s industry-leading models.\n\nIn short, while everyone immediately saw how AI could be disruptive to Search, AI is very much a sustaining innovation for YouTube: it increases the amount of compelling content in absolute terms, and it does so with better margins, at least in the long run.\n\nHere’s the million billion trillion dollar question: what is going to matter more in the long run, text or video? Sure, Google would like to dominate everything, but if it had to choose, is it better to dominate video or dominate text? The history of social networking that I documented above suggests that video is, in the long run, much more compelling to many more people.\n\nTo put it another way, the things that people in tech and media are interested in has not historically been aligned with what actually makes for the largest service or makes the most money: people like me, or those reading me, care about text and ideas; the services that matter specialize in videos and entertainment, and to the extent that AI matters for the latter YouTube is primed to be the biggest winner, even as the same people who couldn’t understand why Twitter didn’t measure up to Facebook go ga-ga over text generation and coding capabilities.\n\nAI Monetization\n\nThe potential impact of AI on YouTube’s fortunes isn’t just about AI-created videos; rather, the most important announcement of last week’s event was the first indicator that AI can massively increase the monetization potential of every video on the streaming service. You might have missed the announcement, because YouTube underplayed it; from their event blog post:\n\nWe’re adding updates to brand deals and Shopping to make brand collaborations easier than ever. We’re accelerating these deals through a new initiative and new product features to make sure those partnerships succeed – like the ability to add a link to a brand’s site in Shorts. And YouTube Shopping is expanding to more markets and merchants and getting help from AI to make tagging easier.\n\nIt’s just half a sentence — “getting help from AI to make tagging easier” — but the implications of those eight words are profound; here’s how YouTube explained the feature:\n\nWe know tagging products can be time-consuming, so to make the experience better for creators, we’re leaning on an AI-powered system to identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time, capturing viewer interest when it’s highest. We’ll also begin testing the ability to automatically identify and tag all eligible products mentioned in your video later this year.\n\nThe creator who demonstrated the feature — that right there is a great example of how YouTube is a different world than the one I and other people in the media inhabit — was very enthusiastic about the reduction in hassle and time-savings that would come from using AI to do a menial task like tagging sponsored products; that sounds like AI at its best, freeing up creative people to do what they do best.\n\nThere’s no reason, however, why auto-tagging can’t become something much greater; in fact, I already explained the implications of this exact technology in explaining why AI made me bullish on Meta:\n\nThis leads to a third medium-term AI-derived benefit that Meta will enjoy: at some point ads will be indistinguishable from content. You can already see the outlines of that given I’ve discussed both generative ads and generative content; they’re the same thing! That image that is personalized to you just might happen to include a sweater or a belt that Meta knows you probably want; simply click-to-buy. It’s not just generative content, though: AI can figure out what is in other content, including authentic photos and videos. Suddenly every item in that influencer photo can be labeled and linked — provided the supplier bought into the black box, of course — making not just every piece of generative AI a potential ad, but every piece of content period. The market implications of this are profound. One of the oddities of analyzing digital ad platforms is that some of the most important indicators are counterintuitive; I wrote this spring: The most optimistic time for Meta’s advertising business is, counter-intuitively, when the price-per-ad is dropping, because that means that impressions are increasing. This means that Meta is creating new long-term revenue opportunities, even as its ads become cost competitive with more of its competitors; it’s also notable that this is the point when previous investor freak-outs have happened. When I wrote that I was, as I noted in the introduction, feeling more cautious about Meta’s business, given that Reels is built out and the inventory opportunities of Meta AI were not immediately obvious. I realize now, though, that I was distracted by Meta AI: the real impact of AI is to make everything inventory, which is to say that the price-per-ad on Meta will approach $0 for basically forever. Would-be competitors are finding it difficult enough to compete with Meta’s userbase and resources in a probabilisitic world; to do so with basically zero price umbrella seems all-but-impossible.\n\nThis analysis was spot-on; I just pointed it at the wrong company. This opportunity to leverage AI to make basically every pixel monetizable absolutely exists for Meta; Meta, however, has to actually develop the models and infrastructure to do it at scale. Google is already there; it was the company universally decried for being slow-moving that announced the first version of this feature last week.\n\nI can’t overstate what a massive opportunity this is: every item in every YouTube video is well on its way to being a monetizable surface. Yes, that may sound dystopian when I put it so baldly, but if you think about it you can see the benefits; I’ve been watching a lot of home improvement videos lately, and it sure would be useful to be able to not just identify but helpfully have a link to buy a lot of the equipment I see, much of which is basically in the background because it’s not the point of the video. It won’t be long until YouTube has that inventory, which it could surface with an affiliate fee link, or make biddable for companies who want to reach primed customers.\n\nMore generally, you can actually envision Google pulling this off: the company may have gotten off to a horrible start in the chatbot era, but the company has pulled itself together and is increasingly bringing its model and infrastructure leadership to bear, even as Meta has had to completely overhaul their AI approach after hitting a wall. I’m sure CEO Mark Zuckerberg will figure it out, but Google — surprise! — is the company actually shipping.\n\nA Bull’s Journey\n\nOr, rather, YouTube is. Close readers of Stratechery have been observing — and probably, deservedly, smirking — at this most unexpected evolution:\n\nThat quote is from Paradigm Shifts and the Winner’s Curse, an Article that was mostly about my concerns about Apple and Amazon, and reads:\n\nAnd, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms.\n\nAppreciating the benefits of Google being an amorphous blob where no one knows what is going on, least of all leadership, is a big part of my evolution; this Article is the second part: that blob ultimately needs a way to manifest the technology it manages to come up with, and if you were to distill my worries about Google in the age of AI it would be to wonder how the company could become an answer machine — which Page and Brin always wanted — when it risked losing the massive economic benefits that came from empowering users to choose the winners of auctions Google conducted for advertisers.\n\nThat, however, is ultimately the text-based world, and there’s a case to be made that, in the long run, it simply won’t matter as much as the world of video. Again, the company is doing better with Search than I expected, and I’ve always been bullish about the impact of AI on the company’s cloud business; the piece I’ve missed, however, is that Google already has the tip of the spear for its AI excellence to actually go supernova: YouTube, the hidden giant in plain sight, a business that is simultaneously unfathomably large, and also just getting started.",

      "headline": "Qualcomm Unveils Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC With Impressive Performance Claims",
      "content": "As expected, along with the latest laptop-class Arm SoC, the Snapdragon X2 Elite series Qualcomm has officially unveiled its latest flagship mobile SoC, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The 8 Elite Gen 5 launch sees Qualcomm lean even further into AI workloads while adding a handful of spec upgrades to the new SoC. It features an Oryon Gen 3 CPU that has two Prime cores capable of up to 4.60 GHz and six Performance cores that run at up to 3.62 GHz, all of which is paired with 24 MB of cache split into 12 MB chunks—12 MB per core cluster. Qualcomm says this will increase single-core performance by 20% and multicore performance by 17%, compared to the likes of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2, that is. Based on Geekbench Browser scores and the information shown off by Qualcomm in the presentation, this means the 8 Elite Gen 5 performs about on-par with its true predecessor, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 3, but early benchmarks from hands-on tests at the Snapdragon Summit tell a different story. It seems as though the 8 Elite Gen 5 delivers single-core Geekbench 6 results of around 3,800 points, with multicore scores coming in at around 12,400 points—a remarkable ~3,000 uplift over the current Geekbench leader, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 3 for Galaxy.Of course, as with much of the recent tech announcements, Qualcomm is focusing heavily on AI workloads with the launch of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. AI performance improvements and NPU upgrades abound, with Qualcomm claiming the new Hexagon NPU is 37% faster and 16% more power efficient than the previous generation. The new Hexagon NPU now also works together with the ISP to process videos more efficiently and quickly. Similarly to how ISPs typically process images, the NPU in the 8 Elite Gen 5 will be leveraged to manage things lighting, color reproduction, and sharpness. Qualcomm also demonstrated generative image processing with the example of removing glare and artifacts from images \"instantly.\" The new NPU will also enable ModelBest on-device agentic AI with onboard training and a memory of past conversations. Supposedly, this AI will be able to access a number of on-device apps, files, and functions, including location, stored images, and social media in order to automatically post, classify photos, and do other generative tasks.The new Adreno GPU is claimed to be 23% faster and 20% more efficient than its predecessor, and it is introducing mesh shading and hardware accelerated ray tracing. The new GPU features a new \"three-slice\" design, with clock speeds reaching up to 1.2 GHz. It also features new Adreno High Performance Memory (HPM), which is an on-board 18 MB memory cache for improved latency and performance. It supposedly increases memory bandwidth by 38% and allows for 10% more efficient gameplay in some games. Qualcomm says that the benefits of HPM are especially noticeable in longer gaming sessions in games like Honkai Star Rail. Qualcomm has also worked with Epic Games to optimize for Unreal Engine features, like Lumen, Nanite, and Chaos Physics Engine. This is all part of the Unreal x Snapdragon Developer Alliance, which is a program that is meant to help encourage game development for Snapdragon platforms.",

      "content": "Following a practically lost decade, Intel has had a busy few months, which culminated in investments by Nvidia and the US government. Now, the chipmaker is looking at Apple to help continue its comeback. Here are the details.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, Intel has been trying to secure an investment from Apple as part of its comeback strategy.\n\nThe report says that the companies “ have discussed how to work more closely together,” although no agreement is in sight.\n\nFrom the report:\n\nIntel Corp. has approached Apple Inc. about securing an investment in the ailing chipmaker, according to people familiar with the matter, part of efforts to bolster a business that’s now partially owned by the US government. Apple and Intel also have discussed how to work more closely together, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the deliberations are private. The talks have been early-stage and may not lead to an agreement, the people said.\n\nIn the last few weeks, Intel has secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, which followed a very public spat between President Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, that began with Trump calling for Tan’s ouster, and ended with the US government taking a 10% stake in the company.\n\nWhen asked about the deal by Bloomberg, neither Apple nor Intel had any comments, but stockholders were quick to react, with Intel’s stock seeing a 6% bump, while Apple saw a 1% dip.\n\nA reunion for the ages?\n\nIt is not immediately clear how an Intel-Apple agreement would benefit Apple, the initial read is that Intel could possibly package the company’s chips, in case the investment does include a rekindling of the ties between the two companies.\n\nAn Intel investment could also benefit Apple’s efforts to appease the US government and show more commitment to domestic initiatives, which currently has the $600 billion American Manufacturing Program as its centerpiece.\n\nIt would also mark a significant reunion, as for many years, Apple relied on Intel as its processor supplier, mainly for Macs. However, following long delays and changes in Intel’s plans that required Apple to hold off on more frequent Mac updates, Apple decided to invest in its own chips, complete with a full architecture switch from x86 to ARM.\n\nDo you thinkg Apple should invest in Intel?

      "headline": "Lithium Americas stock soars 90% on news of potential government stake",
      "content": "Lithium Americas (LAC) stock soared on Wednesday, rising 95% after news reports that the Trump administration is looking to take a stake in the operator of what is set to be the largest lithium mine in the country.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Reuters reported that the administration is seeking a stake of up to 10% in Vancouver, British Columbia-based Lithium Americas as part of renegotiations for a $2.26 billion loan the company received from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass lithium mine.\n\nThe report sent shares in Lithium Americas rocketing upward Wednesday morning. Shares in General Motors (GM), which owns a 38% stake in the project, gained a bit more than 2% on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the terms of the prospective Lithium Americas deal, the mining company has offered the administration no-cost warrants on up to 10% of the company's common shares. The administration is also reported to be seeking purchase guarantees from General Motors, which has $625 million in the project.\n\nThe original loan includes terms that allow the administration to seize control of the project if it is delayed or faces major cost overruns, according to Reuters.\n\nRead more about Lithium Americas' stock moves and today's market action\n\nThe proposed mining project in Nevada would be the largest lithium mining project in the Western Hemisphere, producing more than 40,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate in its first phase, set to begin in 2028 — enough of the metal byproduct to construct 800,000 electric vehicles, according to Reuters.\n\nAlbemarle's (ALB) Silver Peak project in Nevada, the only operating lithium mine in the US right now, produces less than 5,000 metric tons of the metal per year.\n\nThe administration has consistently considered lithium production as a key area in building out domestic supply chains for valuable metals and other commodities like copper and uranium. China produces more than 40,000 metric tons per year of the metal, making it the world's third-largest lithium producer, behind only Australia and Chile.\n\nLithium must be refined after the raw metal is removed from the ground to build products like EV batteries. China currently refines 65% or more of the world's lithium, compared to the less than 3% share in the US.\n\nThe Trump administration's interest in a stake in Lithium Americas mirrors similar moves for stakes in mining company MP Materials (MP) and chipmaking giant Intel (INTC), as the federal government looks to strengthen its position in both domestic production and global supply chains.\n\nShares in MP Materials are up more than 50% since the company's July announcement of a multibillion-dollar deal with the Department of Defense that made the government the largest shareholder of the rare earths miner. Shares in Intel (INTC) are up more than 25% since talks between the chipmaker and the administration were publicly reported.",

      "headline": "Could Intel's Next Big Investment Come From Apple?",
      "content": "Key Takeaways Intel is seeking an investment from Apple after recently securing a $5 billion commitment from Nvidia, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.\n\nApple was once a big customer for Intel, though the iPhone maker has migrated away in favor of using its own processors in its devices in recent years.\n\nIntel has reportedly set its sights on a deal with Apple, a move that could further boost the struggling chipmaker.\n\nShares of Intel (INTC) surged over 6% Wednesday following a Bloomberg report that it's solicited support from the iPhone maker. Neither company responded to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. Shares of Apple fell less than 1%.\n\nWhy This Matters for Intel Investors Wall Street analysts broadly believe Intel likely needs more funds and foundry commitments from customers to succeed with its turnaround plan. Investments from Nvidia and the U.S. government have helped that process along, and one from Apple would mark another step. The stock has clambered higher this year, but it's well off past highs, a reminder that there's plenty of work yet to do.\n\nWith Wednesday's gains, Intel's stock has added a quarter of its value in the week since Intel announced a $5 billion investment from and chip-development partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). The raft of events have excited investors, with the Nvidia news seen as a vote of confidence from the world's most valuable company.\n\nStill, the stock remains well off its highs, with most Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha sticking by \"hold\" ratings while waiting for evidence of more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other firms and which is central to maintaining support from the U.S. government—itself now a major shareholder.\n\nA deal with Apple could help Intel's case, particularly if it came with foundry commitments. Nvidia's did not, raising speculation about whether a foundry deal could come later or whether the lack of one underscored Intel's challenges in convincing customers.\n\n\"If Intel can prove they can deliver they will have customers lined up around the block,\" Bernstein analysts wrote last week. \"If they can’t, no customer in their right mind will put any meaningful volume there.\"\n\nNew partners might also see a deal with Intel as a way to gain political goodwill, Bernstein said. That may hold some appeal to former Intel customer Apple, which has shown some signs of inroads with the Trump administration, last month winning pledges of tariff exemptions based on its recent investments in U.S. manufacturing.\n\n",

Here's what investors need to know today.\n\n1. Stock Futures Point to Slightly Higher Open\n\nStock futures are higher this morning after the market lost ground yesterday following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said the central bank faces challenges in determining interest rates as the labor market weakens while inflation remains elevated. Futures associated with the benchmark S&P 500, the tech-focused Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are pointing to a slightly higher opens for each of the major indexes. Gold futures, which have hit a series of record highs recently, ticked lower to around $3,800 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects a wide range of consumer loans, was little changed at 4.13%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $113,100 recently, up from an overnight low of around $111,000.\n\n2. Micron Reports Strong Results, Issues Rosy Outlook Amid Surging AI Demand\n\nMemory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) posted record quarterly sales and delivered an optimistic outlook on surging demand for AI hardware. Micron reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, both above estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The partner to Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, also ahead of expectations. Shares of Micron, which have nearly doubled year-to-date, were down 1% in recent premarket trading.\n\n3. Stable Coin Issuer Tether Seeks $500 Billion Valuation in Fundraising Deal\n\nStable coin issuer Tether is reportedly seeking to raise as much as $20 billion in private investment in a deal that could put the cryptocurrency firm’s value on par with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Bloomberg reported that the El Salvador-based company is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion in exchange for a 3% stake. The deal could see the company valued at $500 billion. In a social media post, CEO Paolo Ardoino said the funding would help scale by “several orders of magnitude” the firm’s business lines, which also included AI, commodity trading, energy, communications and media.\n\n4. Alibaba Shares Jump on AI Spending Plans\n\nShares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) surged after a report that the firm plans to boost its AI spending. Bloomberg reported that CEO Eddie Wu said the company would ramp up AI spending beyond the original plan announced in February of around $53 billion, as overall spending on the technology worldwide is expected to reach $4 trillion over the next five years. The company will invest in the development of AI models and infrastructure, including plans to build data centers in Brazil, France and the Netherlands, the report said. U.S.-traded shares of Alibaba were up more than 8% ahead of the opening bell.\n\n5. Lithium Americas Stock Soars on Report U.S. Government Will Take Stake in Company\n\nShares of Lithium Americas (LAC) soared in premarket trading on a report that the Trump administration may seek a stake in the mining company as part of a government loan deal. Reuters reported that the government may ask for a 10% stake in Lithium Americas as a condition in renegotiation talks over a $2.26 billion Energy Department loan for its Thacker Pass lithium project with General Motors (GM). Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries and other key electronic equipment. The move would come after the Trump administration took a similar stake in chipmaker Intel (INTC).

      "content": "Just in time for the next generation of AI PC processors, Microsoft has announced that Windows ML is finally ready for production. It’s a key development for local AI and the chips that power its use.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft quietly said that Windows ML is now generally available, seven years after first introducing the technology at Build.\n\nWindows ML will hopefully solve a persistent problem: consumers care about AI, they simply don’t care where it lives. For many people, “AI” is synonymous with ChatGPT, which resides in the cloud. Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD all have invested heavily into local AI, and powerful NPUs capable of dozens of TOPS (trillions of operations per second).\n\nAnalysts say that applications need to be specifically coded for NPUs. Windows ML changes that. “Windows ML is the built-in AI inferencing runtime optimized for on-device model inference and streamlined model dependency management across CPUs, GPUs and NPUs,” Microsoft says.\n\n“This ability to run models locally enables developers to build AI experiences that are more responsive, private and cost-effective, reaching users across the broadest range of Windows hardware,” Microsoft adds.\n\nEssentially, Windows ML is designed to tally all the resources on a PC, and allocate the task or app to the most suitable hardware: GPU, CPU, or NPU. It’s unclear whether Windows ML or the developer will prioritize NPU efficiency or GPU power, but that’s beside the point. If the app can take full advantage of the available hardware, that’s a win-win for everyone.",

      "headline": "Qualcomm unveils Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips that rival Apple M4 Max — specs and release date finally revealed, but you'll have to wait a while",
      "content": "Today at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, the company finally unveiled its next-generation wave of Arm-based PC chips. This time, we're getting two high-end system-on-a-chips (SoCs) in the form of a Snapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme with even more performance designed to rival Apple's latest silicon.\n\nQualcomm has confirmed that these new chips won't launch until early next year, meaning we still have a number of months to wait before we can get our hands on this latest Snapdragon silicon. For now, the company has outlined how these chips are a huge improvement over the original Snapdragon X Elite, built on a new 3nm process that should make these chips more efficient.\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Elite now features both 12- or 18-core configurations, with 6 performance cores and up to 12 prime cores, with a boost frequency up to 4.7GHz. Qualcomm says the X2 Elite boasts up to 31% faster performance at ISO power, while pulling 43% less power than the original Snapdragon X Elite. That translates to better overall performance and efficiency.\n\nIt's the same story in the GPU and NPU department. Qualcomm says the X2 Elite brings a 2.3X increase in performance per watt and power efficiency over the last gen Adreno GPU, though the company hasn't shared total TFLOPS output just yet. The NPU has also been upgraded, now sporting 80 TOPS of compute power compared to the 45 TOPS of the original generation. That should enable more complex and intensive AI compute workloads on device.\n\nBe sure to check out our in-depth comparison between the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite, where we break down all the technical differences and improvements. Below, you'll find a spec table for all the new Snapdragon X2 Elite chips, including the X2 Elite Extreme:\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Feature Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme Snapdragon X2 Elite (88) Snapdragon X2 Elite (80) Model Number X2E-96-100 X2E-88-100 X2E-80-100 Architecture ARM64 ARM64 ARM64 Total Cores 18 18 12 Prime Cores 12 12 6 Multi-Core Max Frequency 4.4 GHz 4.0 GHz 4.0 GHz Boost Frequency 5.0 GHz Single-Core / 5.0 GHz Dual-Core 4.7 GHz Single-Core / 4.7 GHz Dual-Core 4.7 GHz Single-Core / 4.4 GHz Dual-Core Performance Cores 6 6 6 Performance Cores Max Frequency 3.6 GHz 3.4 GHz 3.4 GHz Total Cache 53 MB 53 MB 34 MB GPU Part Number X2-90 X2-90 X2-85 GPU Max Frequency 1.85 GHz 1.70 GHz 1.70 GHz API Support DirectX 12.2 Ultimate, Vulkan 1.4, OpenCL 3.0 DirectX 12.2 Ultimate, Vulkan 1.4, OpenCL 3.0 DirectX 12.2 Ultimate, Vulkan 1.4, OpenCL 3.0 TOPS (INT8) 80 80 80 Micro NPU Dual Micro NPU on the Qualcomm Sensing Hub Dual Micro NPU on the Qualcomm Sensing Hub Dual Micro NPU on the Qualcomm Sensing Hub Memory Type LPDDR5x LPDDR5x LPDDR5x Max Capacity 128+ GB 128 GB 128 GB Configured Capacity 48 GB Device-Specific Device-Specific Transfer Rate 9523 MT/s 9523 MT/s 9523 MT/s Bus Width 192-bit 128-bit 128-bit Bandwidth 228 GB/s 152 GB/s 152 GB/s\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme shares many of the same specs with the standard X2 Elite when it comes to GPU and NPU, but the CPU boasts up to 75% more performance than the competition at ISO power. It can boost up to 5GHz, which the company says is a first for an Arm-based chip. It also has a higher memory bandwidth of 228GB/s.\n\nQualcomm says the X2 Elite Extreme is designed for \"expert-level workloads with ultimate performance, multi-day battery life and blazing fast AI-processing power,\" positioning it as a viable alternative to Apple's latest M4 Pro/Max silicon, with a minimum of 48GB RAM and support for more than 128GB if configured.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

Both Intel and AMD have high-end mobile chips in the form of Arrow Lake and Strix Point, and Qualcomm is confident that its new Snapdragon X2 Elite chips will beat its x86 competition in performance and efficiency too.\n\nThe X2 series will run on a range of PC hardware. (Image credit: Qualcomm)\n\nQualcomm expects these new X2 Elite chips to ship in a wide variety of Windows hardware, including 2-in-1's like the Surface Pro, thin and light laptops, workstation-grade laptops, and mini PCs. It's also possible that with chips like the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme, we'll even see desktop tower PCs with a Snapdragon processor.\n\nThese new Snapdragon chips have come swinging right out of the gate. Qualcomm clearly wants the world to know that its chips are worth considering if you're looking for a Windows PC that's capable of professional grade resource intensive workflows. Notably, Qualcomm didn't announce a lower-tier model of the X2 at this event, as that's likely being saved for 2026.\n\nIf you've been waiting for Qualcomm to refresh its Snapdragon PC chips, the wait is almost over. The company says to expect the first Snapdragon X2 Elite-based PCs to ship in the first half of 2026, with the first devices likely being unveiled at CES 2026 if not sooner. Microsoft intends to ship its own updated Surface Pro 12th Gen and Surface Laptop 8th Gen with the Snapdragon X2 wave of silicon sometime next year.\n\nFollow Windows Central on Google News to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!",

Shares of General Motors (GM), which is partnering with Lithium Americas to build the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, also gained.\n\nReuters quoted a White House spokesperson as saying President Donald Trump supports the project, which is seen as key to boosting domestic lithium production. The mineral is an important component of rechargeable batteries, and U.S. officials have expressed concern about China being the major supplier.\n\nWhy This Matters to Investors Predicting the Trump administration's next moves regarding acquiring stakes in companies can be difficult. A deal involving Lithium Americas would mark the latest such move, following others with companies including Intel and MP Materials—and today's move in the company's stock illustrates how investors are looking to get ahead of official announcements if they can.\n\nThacker Pass, expected to open in 2028, is expected to be the largest supplier of lithium in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Energy approved a $2.26 billion loan to develop Thacker Pass at the end of the Biden administration. Reuters said Lithium Americas was scheduled to take the first tranche earlier this month, but Trump officials moved to renegotiate the agreement over fears the company wouldn’t be able to repay the money because of low lithium prices.\n\nThe administration has already invested in other companies it sees as critical to U.S. national security, notably Intel (INTC) and MP Materials (MP).\n\nLithium Americas is in discussions with the Department of Energy and General Motors \"regarding first draw on the DOE Loan,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nShares of Lithium Americas were up about 3% year-to-date ahead of Wednesday’s session.\n\n",

Its clients include Amazon, Planet Fitness, Holiday Inn, Campbell’s, Hershey’s, Dr Pepper, Mastercard, and Best Buy.\n\nNow, Magid sees agencies as a key growth area for its future, with potential “multi-million dollar upside,” said chief marketing officer John Rood.\n\n“The pressure is on for agencies to deliver both breakthrough creative and measurable results for their clients’ businesses,” Bardzik told ADWEEK.\n\nBardzik joins from BarkleyOKRP, where he was senior vice president of strategic intelligence. He has also held senior strategy roles at The Wonderful Company and worked in Deloitte’s strategy and operations consulting practice, with a focus on consumer packaged goods and agribusiness.\n\nIn his new role, he will help Magid’s agency clients tap into what the firm calls its “EmotionalDNA” data set, which captures insights from more than 1 million respondents on consumer emotions, motivations, and behaviors on an ongoing basis. Agencies can use this data to accelerate briefs, sharpen strategy, and optimize workflows.\n\nMagid also offers AI-powered tools that help agencies work more efficiently. For instance, Collaborator Strategy generates marketing strategy briefs in minutes, and Collaborator Publisher creates on-brand, long-form content.\n\n“We make the digestion of intelligence inputs and translation to a brief that actually gets teams in the direction they need go from weeks or days to minutes,” Bardzik said.\n\nHe added: “We see this as the make or break of daily agency life—we want to make challenging and rewarding the norm and tedious and inefficient a relic.”\n\nMagid’s push into the agency space builds on its nearly decade-long partnership with Horizon Media, which uses the firm’s EmotionalDNA data set to inform client campaigns.\n\n“We’re really proud of our partnership with Horizon, which can serve its clientele with additional intel and help them make better decisions, especially when it comes to category competition and which partners to find,” Rood said.\n\nBardzik added that agencies today are eager for tools that help them streamline workflows without impeding their creativity.\n\n“We rarely speak to an agency that isn’t seeking a way to accelerate and strengthen the briefing process across their clients, more fully put AI to work, and not get in the ways of their strategy and creative teams,” he said.",

      "headline": "Athlon 64: How AMD turned the tables on Intel",
      "content": "22 years ago, on September 23, 2003, AMD changed the game for x86 once and for all. They released the Athlon 64 CPU, a chip that did something Intel didn’t want. Intel didn’t want to extend x86 to 64 bits. But when AMD did it, it forced Intel to clone AMD, rather than the other way around.\n\nWhy Intel didn’t want to go 64-bit\n\nEven in 2001, x86 had decades of baggage attached to it. It was a 32-bit architecture that had been extended from a 16-bit architecture. But that in turn had been extended from an 8-bit CPU design from 1972 that, believe it or not, originated at Datapoint, not Intel.\n\nThis was great for backward compatibility. 8-bit applications were very easy to port to x86 in the early 1980s, and those early DOS applications still ran flawlessly on modern systems 30 years later. For that matter, it’s not impossible to get them running even today.\n\nRemoval of the ability to run 16-bit applications in 64-bit Windows was a design decision, not a technical limitation.\n\nIntel wanted to start over to go 64-bit. Without having to worry about backward compatibility, they could design something that would be faster and more efficient. In theory at least, it would be able to scale higher in clock speed. And there was no question a new design would outperform a theoretical 64-bit x86 when running at the same speed because of efficiency.\n\nAnd if you are cynical, there was one more motivation. If Intel could start over, they wouldn’t have to worry about competing CPU designs, at least not for a very long time. The new design would be encumbered with so many patents, it might be 20 years before someone could clone it.\n\nKeep in mind that in 2003, not only was AMD in the picture, but Transmeta was still in the picture, and Cyrix was fading but not completely gone.\n\nStarting over with a new CPU architecture outright was massively attractive to Intel.\n\nThis new 64-bit architecture wasn’t theoretical, either. Intel was producing it. It was called Itanium, and Intel first released it in June 2001.\n\nAMD’s risky bet and why they made it\n\nAMD was well aware of the shortcomings of extending x86 to 64 bits. And they did it anyway. For them, the stakes were completely different.\n\nAMD knew that if Itanium caught on, that would be the end for them as a CPU company, unless maybe they wanted to become just another ARM licensee. Being just another ARM licensee is more attractive in 2025 than it was in 2003.\n\nBut they could see Itanium wasn’t catching on. It had its uses, and it was doing well enough in those niches, but Windows on Itanium was a non-starter. So much so, The Register called it “Itanic.”\n\nAMD bet that there would be appeal in a 64-bit architecture that was fully backward compatible with x86 and natively ran 32-bit applications at full speed. People would be able to run 32-bit Windows and 32-bit applications on it if they needed to, and then when they were ready for 64-bit software, the hardware was there and ready to go. And they could continue to run 32-bit apps in 64-bit operating systems as long as needed to ease the transition.\n\nThe transition to 32 bits took a decade. AMD reasoned more people would be willing to upgrade to 64 bits if they made that transition as similar as the transition from the 286 to the 386 as possible.\n\nThey believed the market would willingly trade lower 64-bit performance in the long term for better 32-bit performance right away. They also believed that if Microsoft was willing to build Windows on Itanium, they would be willing to take a chance on 64-bit x86 as well.\n\nSo on September 23, 2003, AMD launched its Athlon 64, the first 64-bit x86 CPU.\n\nWhy the Athlon 64 was a hit\n\nAMD64 was everything AMD hoped it would be. It was backward compatible with 32-bit x86. The 64-bit builds of Windows weren’t available immediately, and they didn’t catch on immediately, but you cannot say nobody used them. People did, in fact, use them. In late 2005, I was in charge of administering the complimentary antivirus software that Charter Communications provided to its subscribers. I’m not going to say say someone called me every day wanting 64-bit antivirus for 64-bit Windows. But it did happen once a week.\n\nThe transition took at least as long as AMD expected. When I finally bought an Athlon 64 in 2011, I found native 64-bit software was still scarce. I’m an outspoken Firefox fan; the reason I briefly switched to Google Chrome was to get a 64-bit web browser.\n\nThe Athlon 64 in the enterprise\n\nA few months later, I got a better job with more pay and better growth potential. I can’t talk a lot about the job, but I was administering a mission critical system that ran on Windows, mostly on Dell hardware. I mention Dell because they were exclusively an Intel vendor for years. Cofounder and longtime AMD CEO Jerry Sanders once said of Michael Dell, “I can’t sell him a[n AMD] K6 no matter what I do.”\n\nIt was the Athlon 64 that made Dell relent and finally start using AMD CPUs. Not only were they using them on desktop systems, but they were putting AMD CPUs in servers, an idea that would have been extremely controversial 5 years before. At least in the circles I ran in.\n\nThe Athlon 64 caught on because, in spite of its name, it was an outstanding 32-bit CPU. It was faster than an Intel CPU running at the same clock rate, and it used less power as well. The power consumption was the key to getting into the data center. The Intel name was a security blanket, even though AMD had been making x86 CPUs exactly as long as Intel. But certain decision makers bought Intel marketing and saw AMD as a second tier brand.\n\nThe thing is, when you have a data center with hundreds of systems in it, the money you save on a more efficient CPU really talks.\n\nReplacing Intel Prescott-based servers with AMD64 servers was not a universally popular idea. But you could tell a difference when you were standing behind a rack full of Intel-based servers versus a rack full of AMD based servers. The Intels ran hotter.\n\nFrom an uptime perspective, we couldn’t see a difference. The performance metrics I collected showed there was a slight difference, and that difference was in AMD’s favor. So the AMD critics quickly ate their words.\n\nIntel giving in and cloning AMD64\n\nIn 2004, Intel wrote off the Itanium and cloned AMD64. They called it Intel64, but it was a blatant copy of the AMD implementation. A quirk in the agreements that allowed AMD to use the x86 instruction set also gave Intel the rights to use the AMD64 instructions. So there was nothing illegal about what Intel did. Itanium continued to see use in specialized applications, but Intel quietly discontinued it in 2020.\n\nAMD and Intel have been chasing and catching each other ever since. One of them will pass the other for a CPU generation or two, and then they will change positions. It’s not terribly different from the situation in 1999 with the original Athlon, when AMD outperformed Intel for the first time. The question in everyone’s mind was whether they would do it a second time. The Athlon 64 was the second time.\n\nIt was a big step forward. Eight years before, AMD was trying to pass off a high-clocked 486 as a Pentium equivalent. With the Athlon 64, AMD was innovating.\n\nIf you found this post informative or helpful, please share it! share\n\nshare\n\nsave\n\nshare\n\nshare\n\npocket\n\nshare\n\nemail\n\nRSS feed\n\nDavid Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.

      "content": "A soft earnings report pressured shares of the nation's largest independent used car retailer, while a semiconductor giant extended its rally following reports of investment talks with another tech powerhouse.\n\n\n\nMajor U.S. equities indexes lost ground Thursday, declining for a third straight day ahead of a key inflation report set for release Friday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were down 0.5%, while the Dow ended 0.4% lower. See here for Investopedia's full roundup of the day's market action.\n\nCarMax (KMX) shares plunged 20%, falling the furthest of any stock in the S&P 500, after the used car retailer reported lower-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal second quarter. CEO Bill Nash pointed to challenges including a pull-forward of demand into the previous quarter along with depreciation in the inventory CarMax built up to support sales.\n\nIntel (INTC) shares added to their recent string of gains, popping 8.9% to secure the S&P 500's top daily performance. The move followed reports that the semiconductor maker has been seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL). The iPhone maker was once a major Intel customer but has more recently moved toward the use of its own chips. Shares of Apple were off 1.8% today.\n\nAlthough Jabil (JBL) topped revenue and earnings per share forecasts in its latest quarterly report, shares of the electronic parts supplier slipped 6.7%. CEO Mike Dastoor said artificial intelligence helped drive demand in Jabil's capital equipment, data center, and networking markets, but the integrated circuit maker acknowledged pressure facing its automotive and renewable energy segments.\n\nRothschild Redburn initiated coverage of Oracle (ORCL) stock with a \"sell\" rating. The research firm believes markets could be pricing in an overly optimistic outlook on Oracle's contracted cloud revenue, optimism about which has driven enthusiasm for the stock since its latest quarterly report arrived. Shares of the enterprise software giant dropped 5.6%.\n\nGlobal banking giant HSBC (HSBC) said that it had conducted a successful bond trading trial using quantum computers from International Business Machines (IBM) to optimize market predictions. According to the financial firm, incorporating IBM's quantum computing resources resulted in a 34% improvement in predicting the likelihood that a trade would be executed at a particular price compared with using only classical computing techniques. IBM shares powered 5.2% higher, while HSBC's American depository receipts slipped.\n\nAfter nearly doubling Wednesday after reports that the Trump administration was considering a government stake in the company, shares of Canada-based miner Lithium Americas (LAC) added another 23% Thursday. The company holds a majority stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, which is on track to become one of the largest sources in North America for the battery component. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, gained 4%.\n\n",

      "content": "After receiving a cash injection from SoftBank Group, Nvidia, and even the US government, Intel is now seeking investment from iPhone creator and longtime collaborator Apple.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, and citing \"people familiar with the matter\", Apple and Intel are reportedly in the early stages of conversations about \"how to work more closely together\". No specifics are given on what investments are being asked for or what kinds of conversations are happening, but this is part of a broader comeback attempt from Intel.\n\nIntel has fallen behind in recent times, with the 13th and 14th Gen chip crashes only painting part of the picture. Its recent CPUs haven't been very good for gaming (while AMD has smashed it out of the park in that regard), and Intel admits it \"fumbled the football\" with Arrow Lake. As a result, a lot is riding on Nova Lake, and increased funding would certainly help it make an impact. More funding would help catch up to supply needs for any deals the company can make, too.\n\nApple has a bit of a history with Intel. Prior to the swap to its own M-series chips in 2020, Intel was the central CPU supplier for all MacBooks and Macs. Apple also purchased Intel Mobile Communications back in 2019 for $1B.\n\nApple hasn't really worked with Intel in a public manner in a few years, actively removing all Intel parts from its products and cutting support. But just last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told Jim Cramer, \"You know, competition is very good for the foundry business… we’d love to see Intel come back.\"\n\nTrays and trays of chips awaiting testing. (Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel Foundry is Intel's semiconductor fabrication company, and it's been in a bit of a strange spot for some time. Four former Intel board members pushed for a joint venture between Nvidia, Qualcomm, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Broadcom just last year, before \"the rust of time makes them worthless\". Apple itself has announced renewed investment in American manufacturing in the wake of Trump's tariffs. This is all to say that any investment would likely push towards Intel's manufacturing goals, and not chip design.\n\nAs an everyday MacBook user, the switch to in-house silicon chips is one of the best choices Apple has made in the last decade. Working with TSMC on the latest (and tiniest) node technology, and built with its hardware in mind, the M chips represent a big leap forward in computing power and efficiency. The hardware has become more bespoke without the challenge of having to take off-the-shelf Intel parts and put them in its devices.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nCapable of running games like Baldur's Gate 3 and Lies of P, MacBooks have even become decent gaming devices. Though more competition is certainly good for the market, I'd hope any potential investment from Apple comes at arm's length, as those M-chips feel like a real wonder for the fruit-titled company.",

But, if you’re looking for spoilers on who won Mel’s season of The Golden Bachelor, you’re in for quite the surprise.\n\nAccording to a recent podcast episode from the reality TV blogger, his coverage on the spin-off is going to look different down the line.

Right now, I have none,” Steve said during the September 23 episode of his pod. “I couldn’t tell you where they went for Final Rose ceremony. I can’t tell you who the final three are.”\n\nHe added, “And for the first two seasons of Golden Bachelor and Golden Bachelorette, I had all that info and you knew it, at least for Gerry’s season, you knew who the final two were.”\n\nAs for Mel’s season? He only has one spoiler, which is that Peg makes it to a one-on-one date with Mel at the Orange County Fair at some point. Even the timing is unclear, which is unlike RS!\n\n“I’ve got nothing. I got nothing right now. If I did, I would tell you, but, the days of me coming on the next day after a Golden Bachelorette or a Golden Bachelor and breaking down what we saw on the episode, certainly not gonna be writing anything about it,” he shared. “The coverage of Golden Bachelor is gonna be very, very minimal from me, just because I don’t care, and that’s my stance.”\n\nReality Steve not caring about a season of The Bachelor is low-key groundbreaking.

      "headline": "Intel Updates First-Party Performance Claims of Core Ultra \"Arrow Lake-S,\" How They Stack Up Against AMD",
      "content": "Intel this month released a presentation updating its channel partners and end-users how its Core Ultra 200-series \"Arrow Lake-S\" desktop processors stack up against AMD Ryzen 9000 series \"Zen 5\" processors, including the latest 9000X3D series chips with 3D V-Cache. The company claims a superior balance of gaming and productivity performance at comparable prices. These performance claims take into account the various software and microcode updates the platform received since its October 2024 debut—nearing a year in the market—particularly taking into account advances Intel made to its APO (application performance optimization) software in this time.Intel begins its presentation by layout out its entire Socket LGA1851 desktop processor lineup. The maxed-out Core Ultra 9 8P+16E processors are shown as being competitive to the entire Ryzen 9 9000 series high core-count processors. The Core Ultra 7 265K/KF 8P+12E chips are compared to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which remains the fastest processor for PC gaming. The non-K Core Ultra 7 265 and 265F are compared to the Ryzen 7 9700X. And then the bulk of the Core Ultra 5 6P+8E and 6P+4E lineup is compared to the Ryzen 5 9600X and 9600.The flagship Core Ultra 9 285K is pitted against AMD's flagship part, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D. The gaming performance is shown to be mostly trailing by single-digit percentages, while content creation performance sees performance gains in favor of the 285K in 4 out of 5 tests. Then, in a separate slide, the 285K is pitted against the Ryzen 9 9950X, the chip lacking 3D V-Cache. Here, the gaming performance is mostly at par, while productivity performance sees Intel post leads in all five tests. Sticking with the 285K and 9950X (non-X3D) comparison, and Intel put out a slide with a wider selection of games, where the performance is shown being at par, or favoring the 285K in three out of nine tests. A much wider selection of productivity tests sees the 285K convincingly ahead of the 9950X (non-X3D).Next up, Intel compared the Core Ultra 7 265K with the Ryzen 7 9700X in a wide selection of games. Here, the 265K is shown either at-par or lagging behind the 9700X in 7 out of 9 game tests, and posting gains in 2 of them. Intel's latest pricing sees the 265K go for $299, putting it at an advantage against the 9700X with its $360 price. Armed with 8P+12E cores, particularly those high performance-Watt \"Skymont\" E-cores, the 265K predictably smokes the Ryzen 7 9700X in productivity performance, posting performance gains as high as 84% in multithreaded productivity benchmarks.Interestingly, Intel compared the 265K with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D in a much narrower set of game tests, because the AMD chip bludgeons Intel in 4 out of 5 game tests. \"Starfield\" is the only test where the 265K is shown performing on par. The 265K posts much higher productivity performance owing to its higher core count. Then comes an interesting slide from Intel, where it is comparing the performance-per-Dollar of the $299 Core Ultra 7 265K with the $479 Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and is claiming a 25% lead. Intel compares the 265K to the 9800X3D across a broader set of productivity benchmarks to make its point.Intel also makes an interesting comparison between the Core Ultra 7 265K and the Ryzen 9 9900X 12-core/24-thread non-X3D processor, where the gaming performance is shown to be mostly on-par, however, no comparisons have been made between their productivity performance.We now jump down to the Core Ultra 5 245K, which springs a mixed bag when it comes to gaming. Out of the nine game tests, the 245K trails the Ryzen 5 9600X in three of them, is at par in three others, while leading the 9600X in three. Barring two single-thread heavy productivity benchmarks, namely Photoshop and Cinebench 2004 ST, The 245K dominates the 9600X in multithreaded productivity owing to its higher core-count of 6P+8E.Intel compared the Core Ultra 5 225 with its predecessor, the Core i5-14400, and claimed a geomean of 20% higher gaming performance.Here are some important performance footnotes by Intel:",

      "headline": "NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang Thinks OpenAI Could Be the Next Multi-trillion Hyperscaler",
      "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gives a comprehensive Year in AI Recap and forward-looking discussion on the explosive growth of AI infrastructure, scaling laws, partnerships, competitive dynamics, and geopolitical implications. Nvidia’s recently announced an OpenAI Stargate partnership and an investment in OpenAI. AI computing is an industrial revolution on par with electricity or jet engines. Huang dismisses skeptics on bubbles/gluts and emphasizes Nvidia’s moat through extreme co-design, and advocates for U.S. leadership via pro-growth policies.\n\nAI has evolved from one-shot inference (pre-training + post-training) to thinking AI via chain-of-thought reasoning, tool use, multimodality, and agent systems. This integrates training and inference in reinforcement learning.\n\nThere are now three scaling laws.\n\n1. Pre-training: Memorizing/generalizing data (like 8×8=64).\n\n2. Post-training: AI “practicing” skills through iterative inference.\n\n3. Inference: From one-shot answers to prolonged “thinking” (research, ground-truth checks). This potentially scales compute needs by a billion times. Not just 100× or 1,000× as Huang predicted a year ago.\n\nToken generation doubles every few months.\n\nPerformance per watt must match to avoid cost explosions.\n\nThis drives Nvidia’s annual advanced chip release cadence.\n\nHopper → Blackwell: 30× perf via NVLink\n\nThen Rubin → Ultra → Feynman next.\n\nNvidia invests $100B over time in OpenAI. This is optional and is not tied to sales. Nvidia becomes a preferred partner for self-built AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia is more critical to OpenAI than Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI’s Stargate: 10GW data centers (additive to existing Azure/OCI/CoreWeave builds, totaling 5-7GW+). If Nvidia supplies, ~$400B revenue potential.\n\nOpenAI transitions from outsourcing (to Microsoft or others) and OpenAI strategy becomes a hyperscaler-like self-build.\n\nAI Productivity\n\nAI augments human intelligence. Human intelligence is now ~$50T of global GDP, 55-65%.\n\nIf a $100K employee gets $10K AI → 2-3× productivity then this is hugely valuable\n\nNvidia’s 100% co-agent coverage boosts hiring/growth.\n\n$10T augmentation → $5T capex (50% gross margins) for AI factories generating tokens continuously versus static software.\n\nTAM Estimate: Current $400B annual. 4-5× growth to $1-2T+ by decade-end/ Alibaba: 10× data center power by 2030. This correlates to Nvidia revenue via watts.\n\nNvidia’s Moat: Extreme Co-Design and Annual Cadence\n\nNvidia pace of annual releases would be impossible without internal AI co-design.\n\nProgress has been exponential. Over the last ten years performance from the Kepler→Hopper increased 100,000×.\n\nHopper→Blackwell: 30× via NVLink).\n\nRoadmap: Blackwell (2025), Rubin (H2 2026), Ultra (2027), Feynman (2028).\n\nExtreme Co-Design is used to optimize model/algorithm/system/chip simultaneously. This is beyond Moore’s Law. There are 6-8 chips variants each year.\n\nThere are GPU/CPU/networking/NVLink/Spectrum-X Ethernet. Fastest growing business is the ethernet side of Nvidia. Scales to multi-factory clusters.\n\nMoat Strength is increasing. There is more competition, but it is harder due to scale/wafer costs.\n\n$50B purchase orders on unproven arches only for Nvidia only. Only Nvidia has a proven ecosystem. Supply chain pre-builds $hundreds of billions on Nvidia visibility.\n\nCUDA programmability enables transformer experiments.\n\nASICsc ompetitors are Limited to niches (like transcoders). Large markets demand customer-owned tooling.\n\nGoogle TPUs are going to → v7 (version 7). Google still buys Nvidia GPUs. Even free ASICs lose to Nvidia’s 30× perf/watt (2GW power → 2× revenue).\n\nDisaggregated factories. Dynamo open-sourced. NV Fusion integrates Intel/ARM.\n\nEcosystem and Broader Impacts\n\nElon/xAI/Tesla. Jensen praises Elon as the ultimate GPU. XAI Colossus 1: 230K H100s/H200/B200. Colossus 2 is 500K GB200s and soon 1M. They are potentially at a 1GW first. xAI investment is incredible and XAI has a full-stack build advantage.\n\nSovereign AI is an existential need. Nvidia as global infrastructure partner. There is and will be an energy renaissance with nuclear and gas.\n\nThe US – Trump admin is pro-growth/energy/tech. They provide an Open-door for CEO access. Exports will accelerate. Reindustrialization/upskilling. AI can be an equalizer. It can close tech divide—no coding needed.\n\nIndustrial/digital revolutions accelerated GDP. AI will be co-workers for billions → 4%+ growth.\n\nAbundance age: Raise floor (reindustrialize; AI for all 8B people).\n\nNBF commentary.\n\nOpenAI could go to $2-5 trillion by 2030. Nvidia could go to $8-15 trillion by 2030.\n\nIf XAI is the AI winner then it could go to $5-10 trillion by 2030.",

      "headline": "Trump's new tariffs on drugs, trucks and furniture: Top Story",
      "content": "00:09 Speaker A\n\nWell, the president was pretty busy on Truth Social last night. He unveiled a fresh round of punishing tariffs on a broad range of imported goods, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy duty trucks, set to come into force next week.\n\n00:30 Speaker A\n\nNow, stocks of pharmaceuticals across Asia fell heavily and in fact, in Australia too. And though there was an initial slump in European pharma stocks, the declines were less pronounced.\n\n00:41 Speaker A\n\nIt's interesting to note that GSK's London-listed shares are higher. Now, remember, the UK pharma agreed to invest in the US earlier this month.\n\n00:51 Speaker A\n\nUnsurprisingly, US heavyweight Eli Lilly has seen its shares rise in the pre-market up over 1% there.\n\n01:00 Speaker A\n\nNow, Trump also said he would start charging a 50% tariff on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture. All the new duties take effect from October the 1st.\n\n01:13 Speaker A\n\nAdditionally, according to the Wall Street Journal, the US is also planning to ask chip makers to manufacture at home as many chips as the their customers import in a bid to curb reliance on foreign supply.\n\n01:27 Speaker A\n\nThe Trump administration would levy tariffs on firms that do not maintain a one-to-one ratio over time. The plan is the result of what President Trump referred to last month when he said tech companies that invest more in the US would avoid roughly 100% tariffs on semiconductors.\n\n01:44 Speaker A\n\nNow, if implemented, this could prove to be a big headache for the likes of Apple. It imports chips from all over the world. But firms like Micron and Intel who are increasing production in the US, well, they could benefit.\n\n01:55 Speaker A\n\nOkay, well, here's my colleague Josh Lipton on what else you need to watch today.\n\n02:02 Josh Lipton\n\nAll right, starting off on the Federal Reserve.

      "content": "Trump's TikTok deal payment criticized as 'shakedown scheme' by experts\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration recently approached a coalition of U.S. investors set to take over TikTok's U.S. operations with an ask: Will the group make a payment to the federal government \"in the low billions,\" according to a person with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nThe response from the investors, which includes tech mogul Larry Ellison, the Murdochs and venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz, was an unequivocal yes.\n\n\"Not a single member balked,\" said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \"They see it as something of a finders' fee.\"\n\nWelcome to President Trump's new business agenda: extracting payments as if the federal government is brokering deals like a white-shoe consulting firm fueled by lucrative \"fees for service.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nWhether it's the U.S. taking 15% of Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China, the federal government securing a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel or the Trump administration reportedly seeking an equity stake in Lithium Americas as part of a government loan negotiation, the White House is on a campaign of squeezing businesses with few parallels in modern history.\n\n\"At a minimum, this now means there is a tax imposed on every major business transaction,\" said Luigi Zingales, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago. \"But even worse, businesses will no longer be focused on innovating and creating value and instead the whole game now is rent-seeking. It's all about ingratiating yourself with Trump.\"\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nAsked on Thursday about the multibillion-dollar fee expected to be tacked onto the TikTok deal, which was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, Trump was evasive.\n\n\"We're going to be announcing different things, but the U.S. comes out great,\" Trump said from the Oval Office.\n\ntoggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nTrump has been more direct about defending his administration's private business interventions, including after Intel agreed to sell a 10% stake of the company to the U.S. government following Trump's calls for its chief executive to resign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL,\" Trump posted last month.\n\nMany media companies capitulate to Trump pressure\n\nThis pattern has played out across media, where Trump's longtime war against news organizations has escalated into marshaling the might of the federal government to force concessions.\n\nThe parent companies for ABC and CBS both paid $16 million to settle lawsuits Trump lawsuits filed alleging mistreatment by the networks. The payments went to Trump's presidential library foundation and Trump's legal fees. Shortly after CBS' payment, federal regulators approved the sale of its parent company, Paramount, to Skydance Media, which is controlled by the Ellison family.\n\nMedia companies were already signaling their acquiescence to Trump before he won a second term.\n\nAhead of the election, the billionaire owners of The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times killed parallel editorial endorsements of Kamala Harris. They soon rewired their editorial pages to be less critical of Trump. Both owners — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for the Post and medical innovator Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong for the Los Angeles Times — have major business interests that hinge on decisions by federal officials.\n\nThen there is Jimmy Kimmel. Last week, Disney — which owns ABC — suspended the late-night host after Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr threatened action over Kimmel's remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After a public outcry, including from First Amendment scholars, Kimmel returned on Tuesday with the blessing of ABC and Disney.\n\ntoggle caption Michael Loccisano/Getty Images\n\nTrump lashed out at the network's reversal.\n\n\"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, writing in the same post: \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump allies landing deals sparks criticism of \"crony capitalism\"\n\nAmong those the Trump White House has lined up to take the reins of TikTok's U.S. operation are Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the controlling owners of Fox News, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFrom one view, it can be seen as recognition of the friendly coverage the president often receives from Fox and The Post.\n\nBut Trump and Murdoch have also been at odds. That strife was highlighted in July when Trump sued The Journal and Murdoch over the paper's reporting on the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Murdochs' role in the takeover of America's most popular video app is a remarkable victory for the family and follows a relationship that has at times been combative.\n\ntoggle caption Monica Schipper/Getty Images\n\n\"If you look at Fox News on the one hand and The Wall Street Journal editorial page on the other, I think it's very clear that Rupert Murdoch wants to have bets on every square on the roulette table,\" says Richard Tofel, who was the former assistant publisher of The Wall Street Journal prior to Murdoch's 2007 acquisition of the paper.\n\nBut most of the stakeholders in the TikTok investment group are business leaders who have shown sustained loyalty to the president, which makes the deal look like a reward for fealty, Tofel says.\n\n\"There is a growing set of examples of crony capitalism that the Trump administration is putting into place across this country,\" says Tofel, a lawyer who later went on to become president of the nonprofit investigative news site ProPublica. \"American industry — which would have regarded this behavior from a Democrat as anathema and inconsistent with the tenets of unfettered capitalism — is rolling over for it time after time.\"\n\nExperts say U.S. economy being undermined by \"shakedown schemes\"\n\nThe exact template has varied. In the case of TikTok, the administration is seeking a fee for service. With Intel, the federal government is acquiring an equity stake. For chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, the demand was for a slice of future profits. And with the network television settlements, the payouts arose after personal legal disputes.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"There is no consistent principle at play, just the exercise of Trump's personal power over other people's money,\" said Dael Norwood, associate professor of history at the University of Delaware, who notes that the winners and losers are clear.\n\n\"All Americans — taxpayers, investors, customers, and workers — lose with crony capitalism,\" he said. \"It increases everyone's costs, makes everyone more vulnerable to extortion (or worse), and profoundly degrades our expectations for honesty and fair dealing, society-wide.\"\n\nIn public, corporate executives show support to the president and appear to back such deals, but behind closed doors, some business leaders are expressing deep concern.\n\nYale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld recently helped organize a gathering of more than 100 top CEOs, and he said there was near-unanimous consensus in surveys conducted at the event that Trump's interventions in private business are undermining America's free market principles.\n\n\"These are shakedown schemes. It's a gross violation of what capitalism is supposed to stand for. I'd even call it extortion,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Privately, CEOs are horrified.\"\n\nBut Sonnenfeld said executives are not banding together to push back on Trump, as top business leaders did following Trump's election denialism in November 2020.\n\n\"CEOs need to speak up, like they did then, but they aren't doing it publicly,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"Fear of retaliation is motivating the silence, but there has got to be a trigger line to stop this. We just don't know what that is yet.\"\n\nTalks with American investors for a potential acquisition of TikTok's U.S. enterprise have been moving in fits and starts for the past five years, starting back when the Trump administration declared the Chinese-owned hit video app to be a national security threat and sought to have it banned.\n\nSince Trump's about-face and embrace of TikTok, it has been clear that software and cloud-computing company Oracle would be a major player in the bid to take over the app's American presence.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a close confidante of Trump and the president has said both publicly and in private that he'd like to see TikTok controlled by Oracle.\n\nAccording to the source with direct knowledge of the talks, many of the deal's provisions have been under discussion for months, including that Oracle will host and oversee all of Americans' TikTok data. Beijing-based ByteDance will license its algorithm to the U.S. entity to be retrained based only on the 170 million U.S. users of the app and ByteDance will keep a minority stake in the company.\n\nThe one part of the agreement that caught investors by surprise? The multibillion-dollar fee request.\n\n\"They were taken aback when they were told they'd have to kick in,\" the source said. \"But I think they see it as just the price of doing business right now.\"",

      "headline": "U.S. Could Impose 100% Semiconductor Tariff If Chips Are Not \"Made in America\"",
      "content": "The U.S. government is considering imposing massive tariffs on semiconductor products unless manufacturers can match those volumes with chips produced in the United States. Under the current draft, companies that do not match foreign-sourced chip volumes with domestic output over time could face tariffs that, in some versions, reach 100%. The idea is an act of forceful action to speed up onshore capacity and reduce strategic dependence on overseas foundries, but they also admit that the plan faces serious practical hurdles. The core concept is simple to draft on paper, but hard to implement. For every unit brought into the U.S. from an overseas plant, such as TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung in South Korea, a corresponding unit would need to be produced domestically within a specified timeframe, or tariffs would be applied. This means that for every batch of chips NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, or Apple produce overseas, the same chip would need to be produced in the U.S.Counting and comparing chip \"units\" is extremely complicated. Every semiconductor design differs wildly by complexity, cost, and function, and the typical semiconductor supply chain moves wafers, packages, and finished devices across several countries before a product reaches consumers. Even TSMC, the very maker of the chip, sometimes has a hard time confirming if the designs it makes are on the U.S. sanctions list. Like it experienced with Huawei, TSMC couldn't determine that a third-party shell company was ordering Ascend accelerator IP on behalf of Huawei —which sits on the U.S. blacklist—even with advanced detection tools. Officials are reportedly considering transitional credits and carve-outs for companies that commit to building U.S. fabs, which would allow them to import while new plants come online. Even with those credits, a question arises about how to compare a million small mobile processors against a million high-performance data center accelerators.Enforcing tariffs would require tight coordination among chip designers, contract manufacturers, electronics assemblers, and customs authorities. Companies that send silicon overseas for assembly and then re-import devices would have to trace the origin of every integrated circuit inside complex products, a task that would add compliance costs and could slow procurement, especially for higher-end parts like AI accelerators. Smaller suppliers and niche component makers could be hit hardest if the rules focus only on raw volume rather than product value or technical capability. On the other hand, firms already expanding U.S. manufacturing would stand to gain, as customers look to avoid increasing duties.The ultimate game plan for this tariff proposal would be to create manufacturing jobs at home and to reduce what officials view as a national security risk from concentrated overseas production. However, it could also risk breaking global supply chains: buyers might stockpile, redesign products to use fewer foreign parts, or shift sourcing strategies, any of which could spark short-term volatility for processors, memory, and specialty chips and invite legal and diplomatic challenges from trading partners. For now, the idea remains under discussion, and no final decision has been announced.",

      "headline": "Intel’s Big Comeback Plan Might Rely on Apple",
      "content": "Intel is working hard on a comeback after years of struggle in the semiconductor market. Once a leader, it fell behind rivals like NVIDIA and lost Apple as a customer in 2020. Now, Intel is trying to rebuild its position and is seeking investment from the Cupertino-based tech giant to stay in the race.\n\nIntel wants Apple’s investment to push its comeback\n\nAccording to a report published by Bloomberg, Intel is in early talks with Apple about a possible investment plan. The discussions are still in the initial phase and may not necessarily lead to a final deal. However, this move surely reveals Intel’s commitment to making a comeback in the market.\n\nAs a part of its comeback plan, Intel has attracted major funding from other companies across the globe. NVIDIA, one of its rivals, invested around $55 billion for a stake in the company. Softbank has also proposed $2 billion investment, and the US government has also taken a 10% equity position in the firm. While these investments will surely boost the company’s financials, it now needs customers for its foundry business.\n\nThe Intel-Apple deal is special because, if Apple decides to invest in Intel, it would become the company’s biggest business partner. Apple currently relies on TSMC for the manufacture of its M and A-series chipsets. This deal might very well push it to diversify its chipset supply chain by adding another American manufacturer.\n\nIntel-Apple deal is more than an investment\n\nAs said earlier, the company is already good in terms of finances. But it needs customers to push its comeback. Apple’s support might very well bring the much-needed demand for its most advanced chip-making process, called 14A. Without big customers like Apple, Intel may struggle to make a comeback or become a leader in the semiconductor business again.\n\nHowever, the road ahead is tough for Intel. It lost ground when Apple shifted to its own silicon in 2020, and catching up with TSMC will take time and money. Industry analysts suggests that Intel should try to regain the confidence of its potential customers before pushing for other financial deals.",

      "headline": "Trump may impose per-chip tariff on foreign electronics",
      "content": "In an exclusive report published today, Reuters says that President Trump is considering “imposing tariffs on foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips in each one.” Here are the details.\n\nSince the late-April round of “reciprocal tariffs,” Trump has threatened to impose several measures specifically aimed at curbing US companies’ reliance on foreign chip manufacturers.\n\nDuring the early days of the tariff war with China, he excluded “smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips” from the levies, a measure Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said was temporary.\n\nHe claimed that a “special focus type of tariff” would soon be imposed on these products, but this never materialized. As time passed, several US officials, including Trump himself, floated different measures and tariff percentages.\n\nJust last month, after Apple CEO Tim Cook handed Trump a golden tribute, the President said:\n\n“We’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge even though you’re building and you’re not producing yet in terms of the big numbers of jobs and all of the things that you’re building. If you’re building, there will be no charge. So I just want everyone to know that and I didn’t even tell you that inside. We discussed the concept, but I didn’t. So it’s a big factor. So 100% tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States. But if you’ve made a commitment to build or if you’re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff.”\n\nIn the following weeks, the US would go on to take a 10% stake in Intel, but the 100% tariff also never materialized.\n\nFast-forward to this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration was considering requiring domestic chip manufacturing to match imports “and would impose tariffs on those companies that don’t step up production.”\n\nReuters, meanwhile, just reported the tariff plan based on the number of chips inside foreign-made electronics:\n\nAccording to the plan, which has not previously been reported and could change, the Commerce Department would impose a tariff equal to a percentage of the estimated value of the product’s chip content.\n\nThis new plan, as economist Michael Strain told Reuters, might increase prices even for domestically produced items, “thanks to new tariffs on key inputs needed to make those goods.”\n\n9to5Mac’s take\n\nAs much as Trump has promised to keep Apple and other companies in the clear as long as they keep signaling domestic infrastructure investment, it is a tall order to blindly assume the rules won’t change.\n\nWhatever tariff plan the administration finally settles on, will likely add or change the rules that have been floated in previous unconfirmed plans.\n\nGiven Tim Cook’s recent displays of obedience and submission, it is likely that Apple would get a favorable deal, if not an outright exemption. But as long as the government keeps floating different strategies, and its agenda keeps changing (e.g., Intel stake), there will be very few guarantees Apple will actually get its promised free pass.\n\nAccessory deals on Amazon",

      "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nIntel (INTC, Financials) shares climbed in premarket U.S. trading Friday after reports that the Trump administration is considering new measures to reduce reliance on imported semiconductors by requiring chipmakers to expand domestic production.\n\nBefore the opening bell, Intel rose 2.9%, while GlobalFoundries (GFS) gained more than 5%. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is reviewing a policy that would mandate companies produce in the U.S. the same number of chips they import. Those that fail to meet the threshold could face tariffs.\n\nThe proposal follows last month's move to impose a 100% tariff on all chip imports, with exemptions for companies maintaining U.S. manufacturing operations. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has held discussions with industry executives about the plan, according to the report.\n\nShares of European chipmakers fell after the report. ASML fell 0.3%, ASM International fell 1.4%, and Infineon fell 2.7%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing sank 1.5%, Samsung Electronics down 3.3%, and SK Hynix plummeted 5.6% in Asia.\n\nThe plan reflects attempts to bolster domestic semiconductor supply chains, however analysts expressed questions around practicality given greater labor and infrastructure costs in the U.S. As chipmakers think about where to put their money, they will be quite interested in the result of the policy debate.\n\nIn October, third-quarter earnings reports will be the next thing that moves the sector.",

      "headline": "'Are we going to bet the company's road map on chiplets?' AMD's CEO Lisa Su reminds us how fortunate it was that its executives all said yes",
      "content": "Possible Ep 94 | AMD’s Comeback and Vision for Chipmaking w/ CEO Lisa Su - YouTube Watch On\n\nGiven how much AMD dominates the world of CPUs and gaming in general, it might seem strange to picture such a company on the verge of bankruptcy, being billions of dollars in debt and with few good products on offer. That was the state of AMD over 20 years ago, but thanks to some inspired engineering decisions, those days are now in the distant past. And in a recent interview, CEO Lisa Su tells us that one such choice was betting almost everything on chiplets.\n\nThe interview took place on Reid Hoffman's YouTube channel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of LinkedIn, amongst many other strings to his bow. The two hosts chatted with AMD's CEO, Dr Lisa Su, about her past and what led her to become a chip engineer, as well as all things AI, of course.\n\nFor me, the most interesting part was when Su talked about AMD's decision-making process, which ultimately led to the likes of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D being the most sought-after CPU by PC gamers.\n\n\"We were in a place where the world in semiconductors, for 30 years, really was driven by Moore's law—the idea that every two years or every 18 months you could double the productivity—and so it was all about scaling, scaling, scaling, scaling. But scaling was changing and we saw that change, and yes, we made a few bets.\"\n\nWhen it comes to designing any kind of HPC (high performance computing) processor, any bet that you make takes time to bear fruit, if at all. I'm not talking about a period of a few months, or even a year or two. The timescales involved are around a decade or so, and while that might seem like a ludicrously long time, in the world of processors, that only covers a handful of product cycles.\n\nIntegrated Circuits & Moore's Law: Crash Course Computer Science #17 - YouTube Watch On\n\nIn other words, such bets carry considerable risk. But one in particular turned out to be more than worth it.\n\nSu continued: \"We made the bet that scaling would slow down, and we had to innovate in different ways, and perhaps one of the largest innovations is we were the first to really put high performance computing in sort of breaking it up into what we would call chiplets.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIt's hard to overstate just how important this move was for AMD and perhaps the CPU industry as a whole. Its Zen architecture, launched eight years ago in 2017, was considerably better than earlier designs but still relied on monolithic fabrication (i.e. everything in a single die), which can be costly to scale across every sector.\n\nSplitting its CPUs up into multiple dies, aka chiplets, meant that AMD only needed to make three discrete chips, but it could then use them to make processors for laptops, desktop PCs, workstations, and full-blown servers. Intel, on the other hand, was making completely different chips for each market.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Fritzchens Fritz) (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)\n\nIt might seem like such an obvious move these days, but given how earlier mistakes backfired drastically for AMD, you'd be forgiven for thinking that its leaders were cautious about it all. Not so, it would seem.\n\n\"You know those meetings, back in the day, when I would sit with our technical fellows and we would make that big decision of 'hey, are we going to bet the company's roadmap on chiplets?' and we said yes,\" said Su, looking pleased as punch. \"We had a lot of learning. I mean, I can say there were products that worked really, really well, and there were products that worked not so well, but we learned a ton from the process of that.\"\n\nAnother interesting topic that's discussed in the interview is how AMD has focused almost entirely on HPC. For example, despite the breadth of its processor portfolio, it doesn't make chips for phones. Dr Su explains why this is:\n\n\"Our driving force at the time was to decide what we could be best at. I really believed—my CTO Mark Papermaster has been my partner on this journey—we believed that we could be bet the best in high performance computing, and at the time, high performance computing wasn't as exciting as it is today because AI wasn't as big as it is today and the cloud was you know kind of on a different path.\"\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nMore specifically, she remarks: \"There was a lot of conversation on 'hey Lisa, you know AMD should be making smartphone chips' and then when you look at where things have evolved, you actually realise that companies have sort of fundamental DNA in terms of what they're good at. We are just really good at building big computers, that's what we think about every single day.\"\n\nIt's certainly all worked out very well for AMD. It makes the best CPUs, it dominates the console sector, it has a significant foot in the FPGA market, and as things currently stand, it boasts share prices more than 4.5 times higher than Intel. Despite its vast AI revenue stream, Nvidia's shares are just 10% higher than AMD's.\n\nWith everything Su says in the interview, it's clear what the next decade of AMD will look like: more chiplets, more HPC, more being the best at something. A stark contrast to 20 years ago.",

We will not live on our knees and you shouldn't either.\"\n\nThe charges were brought by the newly appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, former White House aide Lindsey Halligan, who took over the role after Trump ousted U.S. attorney Erik Siebert after sources say Siebert expressed doubts internally about bringing a case against Comey.\n\nPresident Donald Trump with granddaughter Kai Madison Trump speaks to the media as he leaves the White House to board Marine One, in Washington, September 26, 2025.

It is up to the Justice Department, but I can tell you, it is a group of people that was very disappointing,\" Trump said. \"This makes Watergate look like peanuts.\"\n\nComey's indictment came just days after top federal prosecutors at U.S. attorney's offices around the country received a directive to prepare to launch investigations into the Open Society Foundations, a group funded by the billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, on potential charges ranging from support of terrorism to racketeering, sources told ABC News.\n\n\"This DOJ, along with our hard-working and dedicated U.S. Attorneys, will always prioritize public safety and investigate organizations that conspire to commit acts of violence or other federal violations of law,\" a DOJ spokesperson said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Open Society Foundations called the accusations \"politically motivated attacks.\"\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel disputed accusations that the DOJ's probes were motivated by politics.\n\n\"Career FBI agents, intel analysts, and staff led the investigation into Comey and others,\" he posted online Friday. \"They called the balls and strikes and will continue to do so. The wildly false accusations attacking this FBI for the politicization of law enforcement comes from the same bankrupt media that sold the world on Russia Gate -- it’s hypocrisy on steroids.\"\n\nDemocrats like Sen. Peter Welch weren't buying it.\n\n\"President Trump and his Justice Department's indictment of James Comey is a new low for our democracy. The reason for the indictment is clear: Comey is Trump's political adversary,\" Welch wrote on X.\n\nAsked by reporters about the indictment on Friday, Trump said, \"They weaponized the Justice Department like nobody in history. What they've done is terrible. And so I hope -- frankly, I hope there are others, because you can’t let this happen to a country.\"\n\n\"It's about justice, not revenge,\" Trump said. \"It’s about justice.\"\n\nABC News' Rachel Scott contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Description: ParkControl is Pro Windows app to adjust CPU core parking and heterogenous processor scheduling settings.\n\nPro Benefits\n\nBitsum Dynamic Boost\n\nAutomatically switch power plans when your PC enters and leaves the idle state\n\nPower Plan change Notifications\n\nNotifications of when and what process changed your active power plan (image)\n\nSupport Bitsum’s Independent Innovation\n\nYour support enables us to create new tools, and maintain our existing ones!\n\nIntroduction to CPU Core Parking\n\nCPU Parking is a low-power sleep state (C6) supported by most modern processors and operating systems. It dynamically disables CPU cores in an effort to conserve power when idle. Unfortunately, this power saving comes at a price: Latency when CPUs need unparked to execute code.\n\nInitially, core parking was controlled entirely by the operating system. The aggressive core parking of Windows led to a great deal of inefficiency during bursting CPU loads. Intel moved core parking control onto the chip in the Skylake generation, and AMD followed, but still the parameters of the Windows power plans are set to aggressively park CPU cores. Even the default ‘High Performance’ power plan is not immune. The new ‘Ultra Performance’ power plan copies what Bitsum did with our own ‘Bitsum Highest Performance’ power plan and finally disables core parking entirely.\n\nParkControl (and Process Lasso) not only let one more easily configure CPU core parking and frequency scaling, but also allow for dynamic entrance into a higher performance power plan. For instance, with Process Lasso, you can automatically enter ‘Bitsum Highest Performance’ will you start a game, then go back to ‘Balanced’ when you exit.\n\nParkControl has Dynamic Boost to allow you to set active and idle power plans. Process Lasso has a similar feature with its IdleSaver.\n\nEfficacy of Disabling Core Parking\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that disabling CPU core parking can make a tangible improvement in system performance. There are many factors that will determine precisely how effective it will be for a given situation. However, generally, Windows is too aggressive in its core parking, resulting in high latency during bursting CPU loads, stemming from the overhead of having to unpark CPU cores. Since bursting CPU loads are the most common type for many workloads, core parking can be a substantial drag on system performance and responsiveness.\n\nUsing ParkControl\n\nParkControl lets you easily set CPU core parking and frequency scaling parameters for both AC (plugged-in) and DC (battery) power states of your device.\n\nBoth CPU core parking and frequency scaling are power saving features of modern CPUs. CPU core parking is when cores are put into a sleep-like state when demand is low. Similarly, CPU frequency scaling allows the CPU base frequency to be lowered, again to conserve energy.\n\nEach power plan has its own settings, and can be selected via the power plan drop-down. When you select a power plan, the user interface will populate with that power plan’s settings. After making changes, click the ‘Apply’ button to save them. Use the ‘Make active’ button to switch the PC to that power plan.\n\nRelease Name: Bitsum ParkControl Pro 5.5.0.8\n\nSize: 3.6 MB\n\nLinks: HOMEPAGE – NFO – Torrent Search\n\nDownload: RAPiDGATOR",

      "content": "Qualcomm Unveils New Chips with Enhanced Security Features for PCs and Phones\n\nQualcomm has recently announced the release of its latest chips designed for both PCs and phones. This exciting launch includes a brand-new PC chip featuring unprecedented security features targeted at business users, a development that analysts are calling a first of its kind.\n\nBased in San Diego, Qualcomm stands as one of the world’s largest vendors of mobile chips, specializing in the technology that connects phones to wireless data networks. For the past couple of years, the company has strategically expanded its reach into the PC market, aiming to compete directly with giants like Apple. The goal is to offer energy-efficient chips for laptops and PCs operating on the Windows operating system.\n\nAccording to reports, Qualcomm’s new laptop chip, the ‘Snapdragon X Elite,’ is slated for release next year. It will come equipped with a groundbreaking new security feature named ‘Guardian,’ explicitly tailored for large business clients purchasing desktops and laptops.\n\nDuring a presentation, Kedar Kondap, senior vice president of gaming and compute at Qualcomm, explained that this innovative security feature will enable business IT departments to securely update or provide tech support to computers, even when they are turned off.\n\nWhile Intel has offered similar functionalities for business computer management for over a decade, Qualcomm plans to differentiate itself by integrating its security capabilities with its 5G and mobile network-connected modem chips. This synergy will allow the computer’s owner to monitor their device from anywhere in the world, provided they have access to a mobile network. This presents major implications for data protection and remote access.\n\n“No one else can offer this kind of feature,” noted Ben Bajarin, CEO of tech advisory firm Creative Strategies. “This could be incredibly useful for a significant portion of the workforce and will likely generate even more interest in Qualcomm within the business sector.” This innovative offering represents a major step forward in computer security and enterprise solutions, solidifying Qualcomm’s position in the competitive technology market and creating exciting business opportunities.",

      "headline": "From Wall Street to academia, who is in Trump's line of fire?",
      "content": "US President Donald Trump has escalated his criticism and actions against executives, corporations and institutions. His unprecedented actions — from novel export deals to frozen university grants — have upended the status quo between the government, law, academia and corporate America.\n\nOn Friday, Trump called for the firing of Lisa Monaco, Microsoft's global affairs president, calling her a \"menace to US National Security.\"\n\nGoldman's economic research arm had published a note in August that said US consumers had absorbed 22 per cent of tariff costs through June, and their share could rise to 67 per cent if the recent levies follow the same pattern as the earliest ones.\n\n\"David Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, shortly thereafter.\n\nTrump said it was mostly \"companies and governments, many of them foreign, picking up the tabs.\" He also took a dig at Solomon for his former DJ-ing hobby.\n\nINTEL\n\nIn early August, Trump demanded Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan step down due to China ties. Reuters had reported in April that Tan invested at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military.\n\n\"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTan responded to Trump, saying he shared the president's commitment to advancing US national and economic security and that the Intel board was \"fully supportive of the work we are doing to transform our company.\"\n\nAfter a meeting between the two, Trump praised Tan and the US government decided to take a stake in the chipmaker.\n\nMICROSOFT\n\nTrump on Friday said that the tech giant should fire its global affairs president Lisa Monaco, who served in the administrations of past Democratic presidents.\n\n\"She is a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco.\"\n\nTrump said Monaco, in her position at Microsoft, would have access to highly sensitive information and her \"having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand.\"\n\nMonaco, who started working at Microsoft in July, was a security aide in former president Barack Obama's administration and served as the deputy attorney general in former president Joe Biden's administration.\n\nTESLA\n\nThe electric automaker's billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars supporting Trump's re-election, a move investors who bid up Tesla stock expected to benefit Musk's empire.\n\nTrump and Musk, however, fell out in June after Musk criticised Trump's sweeping tax-cut and spending bill because it was projected to increase federal debt.\n\nResponding to that on Truth Social, Trump threatened to cut federal subsidies and contracts to Musk's companies and said the billionaire \"just went CRAZY\" after losing the electric-vehicle mandate in the bill.\n\nADRIAN MARDELL, FORMER CEO, JAGUAR LAND ROVER\n\nTrump criticised Jaguar's rebranding effort in August, calling the campaign \"woke\" and \"stupid,\" and linking it to the departure of the company's CEO.\n\nThe remarks from Trump came as the British carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, announced the retirement of CEO Adrian Mardell, who spent more than three decades at the company.\n\nJaguar last year unveiled a new logo and visual identity as part of a brand refresh aimed at repositioning itself as an electric automaker, a move that drew sharp online backlash and criticism from brand loyalists.\n\nAPPLE\n\nTrump has repeatedly targeted Apple and its boss, Tim Cook, for making US-sold iPhones outside the country and has threatened company-specific tariffs.\n\nIn May, Trump recalled, after a meeting in the Qatari capital Doha, that he had confronted Cook about the company's plan to make most of its iPhones sold in the US at factories in India by the end of 2026.\n\nTrump had said in a social media post he told Cook \"long ago\" that \"I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.\"\n\nTrump in early August announced Apple would invest an additional $100 billion in the US, raising its total domestic commitment to $600 billion over the next four years. Cook also gave Trump a US-made souvenir with a 24-karat gold base.\n\nTrump called Amazon's former CEO Jeff Bezos in April to complain about a news report that said the company planned to display prices showing the impact of tariffs on e-commerce retailer Amazon.com.\n\nHowever, Amazon said it had only briefly considered listing import charges for some goods in April following Trump's tariff announcement, but dropped the plan as the White House accused the company of a \"hostile political act.\"\n\nTrump later told reporters that Bezos had solved the problem \"very quickly\" and was \"very nice.\"\n\nTrump in August alleged that BofA CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon discriminated against him and his supporters. Earlier he had said they did not provide banking services to conservatives.\n\n\"What you're doing is wrong,\" Trump said, in a video address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Trump did not cite evidence or specifics of any wrongdoing, in a question-and-answer session with corporate leaders and CEOs assembled on stage.\n\nHe also referenced JPMorgan's Dimon. \"You and Jamie and everybody, I hope you're gonna open your bank to conservatives.\"\n\nBoth lenders have denied the allegations of \"debanking\" on multiple occasions.\n\nTrump said in May Walmart and China should \"eat the tariffs\" and not burden American shoppers, after CEO Doug McMillon said the retailer could not absorb all tariff-related costs because of narrow retail margins.\n\n\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\nWhile Trump did not call out McMillon personally, he publicly criticised Walmart for attributing its price hikes in May to tariffs imposed by his administration.\n\nCRACKER BARREL\n\nThe restaurant chain's brief change in its logo — removing the long-standing image of an overall-clad man known as \"Uncle Herschel\" leaning against a barrel — is the most recent in a series of dustups where an unexpected response has blindsided retail chains.\n\nCracker Barrel in late August said it will stick with its decades-old logo, scrapping plans for a new one following social media backlash, including from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Congratulations 'Cracker Barrel' on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it,\" Trump said on Truth Social after the company's reversal.\n\nCOMCAST\n\nTrump criticised Comcast and its cable news network MSNBC for its news coverage of his administration. He said to reporters, \"They're changing the name because they're ashamed of it, and they're disassociating it from NBC,\" referring to MSNBC's name change to MS NOW.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform in August, Trump also called Comcast a \"weak and ineffective owner ... headed by ... Brian Roberts.\"\n\nSMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION\n\nThe White House has said it will lead an internal review of some Smithsonian museums and exhibitions ahead of the 250th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence.\n\nIn an executive order in March, Trump said the institution had come under the influence of a \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in recent years.\n\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY\n\nTrump targeted the country's oldest and richest university, cancelling about $2.5 billion federal grants, and mounted efforts to cut off research funding to Harvard, as a part of a larger campaign to force change at US universities, which Trump says are gripped by antisemitic and \"radical left\" ideologies.\n\n\"We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!\" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform in May.\n\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY\n\nIn March, the Trump administration said it was penalising Columbia University over how it handled last year's protests by cancelling $400 million in federal funding.\n\n\"This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\nThe comments came after the arrest of Palestinian graduate student Mahmoud Khalil played a prominent role in the protests.\n\nIn July, the university said it will pay over $200 million to the US government in a settlement with Trump's administration.\n\nLAW FIRMS\n\nTrump targeted law firm Perkins Coie in March with an executive order that suspended security clearances for its employees and restricted their access to federal buildings over its ties to Hillary Clinton and DEI policies.\n\nTrump had said it was \"an absolute honor to sign\" the order. Trump also targeted New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in March with a similar order, which he later withdrew after striking a deal.\n\nLaw firm Covington & Burling faced Trump's presidential memorandum in February, which suspended security clearances for Peter Koski and all Covington employees who assisted former special counsel Jack Smith, who prosecuted Trump.\n\nCovington had said it would continue representing Jack Smith despite these measures.\n\n\"We're going to continue holding the people who were responsible for the weaponization of government — who supported it — accountable,\" Trump had said.\n\nPublished on September 27, 2025",

      "headline": "Trump demands Microsoft fire global affairs head Lisa Monaco | TechCrunch",
      "content": "President Donald Trump declared Friday that Microsoft needs to fire Lisa Monaco, the company’s president of global affairs.\n\nCiting her roles as “a senior National Security aide under Barack Hussein Obama, and a Lawfare and Weaponization obsessed Deputy Attorney General under Crooked Joe Biden and Lisa’s Puppet ‘Boss’ Attorney General Merrick Garland,” Trump posted on Truth Social that Monaco’s current role gives her access to “Highly Sensitive Information,” which he deemed “unacceptable.”\n\n“It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,” he wrote.\n\nAs Trump noted, Monaco worked with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden, including as a deputy attorney general under the Biden administration. Trump rescinded Monaco’s security clearance earlier this year, in an order that did the same for Biden, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, and the Biden family.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. Monaco joined the company in May, taking on a role overseeing the company’s cybersecurity policy and its relationship with world governments.\n\nFar-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer has repeatedly criticized Microsoft for hiring Monaco in posts on X, complaining in one post that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was “born in India” and accusing him of “disgraceful scammer behavior.” On Friday, Loomer triumphantly quoted Trump’s post and again called on the president to “cancel all of Microsoft’s government contracts.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has targeted a tech executive since returning to office. He previously said that Intel president Lip-Bu Tan must “resign immediately” over alleged conflicts of interest. Then, after Intel gave the government a 10% stake in exchange for funding already committed by the Biden administration, Trump described Tan as a “Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer.”",

      "headline": "Nvidia CEO bets $100 billion on OpenAI becoming a multi-trillion-dollar company — Jensen outlines his view on OpenAI's path to becoming one of the biggest companies in the world",
      "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes OpenAI is on track to become a multi-trillion-dollar company, citing explosive growth and scale as the foundation for what could be the fastest rise to that valuation in the industry’s history. Speaking on the BG2 podcast, Huang said that OpenAI “is likely going to be the next multi-trillion-dollar hyperscaler company.”\n\nHis comments come on the heels of a high-stakes infrastructure pact between Nvidia and OpenAI. Earlier this week, the companies announced a letter of intent for up to 10 GW of GPU-powered data centers to be deployed through OpenAI’s preferred cloud partners. Nvidia, in turn, agreed to invest as much as $100 billion in those systems as capacity comes online, making it one of the largest vendor-led bets on AI infrastructure to date.\n\nIn doing so, Nvidia is effectively underwriting the next generation of AI growth by ensuring its silicon roadmap stays in sync with OpenAI’s compute ambitions. The deal anchors future demand for Nvidia’s Rubin-class platforms and next-gen networking hardware, while also giving OpenAI early access to systems that may not reach general availability for years.\n\nIt also helps to bolster Nvidia’s dominance in the AI supply chain. Major cloud providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, have an insatiable appetite for GPU capacity, and Nvidia’s partnership strategy effectively pulls demand forward, locking hyperscalers like them into multi-year commitments while competitors like AMD and Intel are still playing catch-up. Expand the tweet below to see Jensen's explanation of OpenAI's path to a multi-trillion-dollar valuation.\n\n📁 Jensen Huang believes OpenAI is the next trillion-dollar company, and that’s why he’s investing. pic.twitter.com/bwI3ELEa4tSeptember 26, 2025\n\nAt 10 GW, OpenAI’s planned footprint and its associated capital expenditure have already pushed the plans into high-risk, high-reward territory. OpenAI recently struck a $6.5 billion expansion deal with CoreWeave, one of Nvidia’s key hosting partners, to help finance the rollout.\n\nNvidia also holds a stake in CoreWeave, and critics have raised concerns about the concentration of capital, hardware, and access among a small number of companies. However, that doesn’t seem to matter to Huang, who apparently believes that AI’s future will be defined by those who can scale infrastructure the fastest. OpenAI is outpacing even the most aggressive growth curves seen during the rise of cloud computing.\n\nNvidia’s ability to pre-sell entire generations of high-end GPUs into AI deployments will also have knock-on effects on the wider industry, including gaming card availability and workstation pricing. If OpenAI consumes a significant portion of future Rubin or Rubin Ultra supply, it could widen the gap between data center and consumer release cycles, making it even harder for consumers to obtain timely access to Nvidia’s latest hardware.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

      "content": "Moore's Law is Dead has leaked new information about Intel's Panther Lake laptop CPUs. The top-spec model will come with a 16-core CPU (4 P + 8 E + 4 LPE) and a 12 EU Celestial iGPU.\n\n4 Reviews ← exclude selected types\n\nYouTuber Moore's Law is Dead has revealed what Intel has in store for laptops with the Panther Lake platform. The latest leak says Intel's top-spec Panther Lake-H chip will come with 4 Cougar Cove performance cores, 8 Darkmont efficiency cores, and 4 Darkmont LPE cores.\n\nIts CPU tile will be made on Intel 18A, the GPU die on TSMC N3E, and the Platform Control Die on TSMC N6. On the GPU side, Panther Lake was tipped to arrive with up to a 12 EU iGPU based on Intel's Celestial architecture.\n\nThis is at odds with a leak from last year, which predicted a total of five Panther Lake CPUs with the top-spec model tipped to arrive with 6 P-cores, 8 E-cores and 4 LPE cores. Then again, the same leak stated that the two SKUs with 6 P-cores were further behind in development than the aforementioned SKU with 4 P-cores.\n\nThe leak adds that Panther Lake's LPE cores will actually be usable by applications this time, something that wasn't possible in previous generations. Moore's Law is dead estimates a 5-13% IPC increase, but states it has been challenging to predict IPC uplift in recent Intel CPUs.\n\nThe top-spec Panther Lake SKU will have a maximum TDP of up to 45 Watts, which is slightly higher than the Core Ultra 9 288V's 30 Watts. Additionally, it might be possible to push other (non-Core Ultra 9) SKUs to that figure, something that wasn't possible with Lunar Lake.",

      "content": "Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News host Sean Hannity that “weaponization has ended” — in the same breath as she listed Trump opponents she intends to target for investigation and potential prosecution.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave Bondi marching orders to go after a list of enemies in a DM-style Truth Social post and again in remarks to reporters this week, after which the James Comey indictment dropped.\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters Friday, Trump denied the indictment was about revenge, and claimed he has no enemies list — but predicted more indictments.\n\nBondi was a guest on Friday night’s edition of Fox News Channel’s Hannity, during which she picked up where Trump left off even as she assured Hannity that “weaponization” is a thing of the past:\n\nSEAN HANNITY: I would imagine you’re not allowed to get into the specifics of the case. I won’t waste your time asking you however, when you look at the magnitude of what Kash Patel is saying, a grand conspiracy that from the minute he came down the escalator with Melania all the way through. You know Russia Russia, two impeachments. All the way through the Hunter Biden laptop suppressed. All the way, through weaponization. Pam I’m nervous for the country when I put it all together AG PAM BONDI: You shouldn’t be nervous any longer because donald trump is in office and the weaponization has ended! We’ve made that very clear. Whether you’re a former FBI director, whether you’re a former head of an intel community. Whether you are a current state or local elected official. Whether you are a billionaire funding organizations to try to keep donald Trump out of office. Everything is on the table. We will investigate you and we will end the weaponization. No longer will there be a two-tier system of justice and we are working hand-in-hand, Director Patel and I, Todd Blanche, with our incredible intel community.

      "headline": "Obama’s final booby trap",
      "content": "In the final days of the Obama presidency — while Americans were focused on inaugurating a new president and turning the page on a divisive era — President Barack Obama signed a quiet but sweeping executive order that many now see as a ticking time bomb planted in the heart of our Intelligence Community.\n\nOn January 3, 2017, just 17 days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, Obama signed a modification to Executive Order 12333, authorizing the National Security Agency (NSA) to share raw signals intelligence (SIGINT) with all 16 other intelligence agencies — including the FBI, the CIA, and even obscure agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration’s intel wing.\n\nAt face value, the stated purpose was to “streamline intelligence sharing” and “improve coordination” in the age of global terrorism. But conservatives saw something else: a calculated move to weaponize the intelligence apparatus against a political outsider — Donald J. Trump — before he could even take the oath of office.\n\nFrom Terrorism to Trump? The Convenient Shift\n\nPrior to this change, the NSA — which vacuumed up massive amounts of phone calls, emails, texts, and metadata — could share only filtered, “minimized” intelligence with other agencies. That meant masking the names of American citizens incidentally caught up in foreign surveillance.\n\nBut Obama’s executive order reversed that policy, allowing raw, unredacted data — including conversations of U.S. citizens — to be freely distributed across the Intelligence Community. In short, the firewalls were gone. The surveillance spigot was opened.\n\nWhy now? Why not during his eight years in office?\n\nThese are the questions conservatives have been asking ever since.\n\nA Leak Pipeline Disguised as Reform\n\nWithin weeks of the order, classified leaks about members of Trump’s incoming administration began flowing.\n\nThe most prominent example? Lt. General Michael Flynn.\n\nIn early 2017, intelligence officials leaked transcripts of Flynn’s phone calls with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak — conversations recorded by the NSA and circulated under the new data-sharing regime. The leaks forced Flynn’s resignation as national security adviser after just 24 days and ignited a firestorm that crippled the Trump presidency for years.\n\nFlynn was later cleared of criminal wrongdoing, but the damage was done.\n\nSo let’s connect the dots: Obama expanded access to unfiltered NSA data in his final weeks. Those raw data were then used — and leaked — to undermine a sitting president. If that’s not a setup, what is?\n\nThe “Unmasking” Epidemic\n\nEven more disturbing was the surge in “unmasking” requests from Obama-era officials during the transition period.\n\nUnmasking is the process by which an official asks to reveal the identity of a U.S. citizen caught up in foreign surveillance. According to declassified records, senior Obama officials — including then–vice president Joe Biden, U.N. ambassador Samantha Power, and even James Clapper — submitted dozens of such requests targeting the Trump team.\n\nThe justification? Vague national security concerns. But in hindsight, it’s clear these unmasking requests were part of a broader strategy to surveil, leak, and neutralize political opponents before they could govern.\n\nAnd it was all made possible — or at least much easier — thanks to Obama’s executive order.\n\nDeep State Entrenchment 101\n\nTo critics, this wasn’t just an intelligence reform; it was the institutionalization of the Deep State.\n\nThe order ensured that hundreds, if not thousands, of additional analysts and bureaucrats across 17 agencies could now legally access the NSA’s digital gold mine. With more hands on the data, leaks were harder to trace. And with a hostile press eager to delegitimize Trump, the stage was set for a political slow-motion ambush disguised as “whistleblowing.”\n\nWhile the term “Deep State” may sound conspiratorial, what else do you call a network of entrenched bureaucrats using classified tools to sabotage an elected president?\n\nWas It Legal? Sure. Was It Ethical? Not Even Close.\n\nDefenders of the order point out that it was technically within Obama’s legal authority. But legality is not the same as legitimacy.\n\nA president expanding intelligence access to his loyalists — weeks before handing power to a political rival — doesn’t pass the smell test. If a Republican had done this to a Democrat, the media would have howled about authoritarianism and privacy violations.\n\nBut in this case? Crickets.\n\nIn fact, most mainstream outlets didn’t even report on the executive order until months later, long after the leaks had done their damage.\n\nThe Real Legacy of Executive Order 12333\n\nFor all of Obama’s claims about “transparency” and “civil liberties,” his final act expanded the surveillance state more than any other modern president.\n\nAnd for what? To catch terrorists? Or to target political opponents under the guise of national security?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nThe order enabled widespread access to sensitive, raw intelligence.\n\nThat data were leaked in unprecedented ways — targeting Trump officials.\n\nThe leaks disrupted a duly elected administration.\n\nAnd the media cheered it on.\n\nThis wasn’t a glitch in the system. It was the system.\n\nConclusion: A Blueprint for Future Abuse\n\nObama’s parting gift was a booby-trapped surveillance infrastructure, tailor-made to hinder anyone who dared challenge the political establishment. In that light, the Flynn leak wasn’t a scandal; it was a preview.\n\nConservatives must never forget this moment. Executive orders may not make headlines, but their impact can reshape the Republic. The next time a “national security” measure is rolled out in the dead of night, we should all ask: Who gains power — and who loses his freedom?\n\nBecause once the intelligence machine is turned inward, the target is no longer terrorists. It’s you.\n\nImage: Gage Skidmore via Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0.",

      "content": "Jesse Watters ran a very damning segment on the origins of the Trump-Russia hoax.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard uncovered documents that were hidden for ten years that show Barack Obama was leading efforts to make it look like President Trump and Vladimir Putin stole the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton.\n\nObama ordered his corrupt CIA Director John Brennan to create this fake assessment.\n\nThis ties the former President Obama directly to the Trump-Russia hoax.\n\nDirty Obama was leading the efforts to take down Trump.\n\nBarack Obama, who offered ‘hope and change,’ was actually a blight on our country’s history.\n\nJesse Watters reported: The Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, released a bombshell report today that shows a conspiracy by a sitting President, Barack Obama, and his intel agencies to sabotage the President-elect, Donald Trump, brainwash the electorate, and undermine the legitimacy of an election. There is irrefutable evidence that detail how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment that they knew was false. They knew it would promote this contrived narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help President Trump win, selling it to the American people as though it were true. It wasn’t. Gabbard got her hands on a House intel report that’s been locked away in a CIA vault for almost a decade. Investigators spent over 2,000 hours looking into how the Russia hoax was born, interviewing 20 CIA and FBI officials. It turns out that the Obama administration doctored the intelligence to make it look like Putin and Trump stole the election… …Senior CIA officials repeatedly refused to traffic in these allegations. But they were repeatedly overruled by CIA Director Brennan and FBI Director Comey, who insisted that they be pushed even without verifiable evidence. The Obama administration cherry-picked the intelligence, lied about their sources, misquoted sources, didn’t corroborate their claims, suppressed intelligence that ran counter to their narratives, and even used anonymous internet postings. Rank and file CIA admitted what they were doing violated their own Tradecraft standards. There was a massive pressure campaign that came right from the top. Cia analysts say they received unusual directives from political appointees, the CIA director and Obama himself.\n\nNow we have the proof – It was Obama leading the efforts to destroy Donald Trump.\n\nSo much for hope and change!\n\nThis right here should be enough evidence to lock up Obama, Brennan, and Jim Comey for years.\n\nTREASON Tulsi has uncovered documents that were hidden for ten years, showing Obama doctored the intel to make it look like Putin and Trump stole the 2016 election Obama ordered Brennan to create a fake assessment ALL ROADS LEAD DIRECTLY TO OBAMA pic.twitter.com/Bt9kiC8vQD — @Chicago1Ray (@Chicago1Ray) September 26, 2025\n\n[Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on The Gateway Pundit.com.]",

      "headline": "These people grew up under dictators. They're worried about what's happening here.",
      "content": "As a child in Cuba, Mike Fernandez watched as his teachers were replaced with government instructors, books vanished from classroom shelves and ultimately, Communist Party officials took over his dad's tiny sandwich stand.\n\nNow the self-made billionaire and longtime Republican campaign donor watches uncomfortably from South Florida as President Donald Trump takes many of the same steps he saw under Fidel Castro.\n\nLike many people who fled to the United States from authoritarian regimes, Fernandez says the United States appears to be at a tipping point, with Trump centralizing power to silence dissent and punish people he's declared enemies, while bullying private businesses to fall in line.\n\n\"There's something wrong, and we all know it,\" Fernandez told USA TODAY. \"Many people are hoping it's going to go away on its own, and it's not going to go away on its own.\"\n\nThe billionaire émigré added: \"I'm scared of how fast we're moving.\"\n\nTrump argues that the 2024 election he won represents a mandate from American voters who endorsed his muscular leadership approach. Trump has justified his actions as necessary to secure the United States from both an \"invasion\" of immigrants and what he describes as the unwillingness of Democratic officials to stamp out visible homelessness, halt certain types of crimes and prevent civil disorder.\n\nA historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in August of his first years in office − both as the 45th and 47th presidents − are lower than any other modern president at the same time in their administrations. In Gallup's polling, roughly 40% currently approve of Trump's job performance.\n\nDespite the unfavorable polling, Trump has repeatedly suggested that he would serve a third term as president ‒ although the Constitution prevents him from being elected again ‒ and openly mused about how other countries have canceled elections during war or other national emergencies.\n\nWarning signs of authoritarianism\n\nPeople who have fled authoritarian regimes say it's a combination of actions that are cause for concern right now in the United States, especially after Trump declared at activist Charlie Kirk's funeral that he \"hates\" his opponents. Those interviewed by USA TODAY raised a host of parallels they see between the authoritarian leadership of their native countries and Trump's actions over the last eight months:\n\n◾Routine use of military forces to disperse anti-government protests, especially over the objection of local officials, as happened in California and Washington, DC.\n\n◾Declarations that certain rights, especially for certain groups, must be curtailed because of a national emergency, such as ending due process hearings for accused undocumented immigrants.\n\n◾Singling out minority groups for harsh and selective prosecutions, often based on old laws. The White House has argued its immigration crackdown largely reflects a return to enforcing existing law that successive past presidents ignored.\n\n◾Reduced access to legal counsel, especially for those targeted minority groups.\n\n◾Nationalization of businesses deemed critical to the government's success. Trump announced on Aug. 22 that the federal government would purchase a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, and has expressed interest in buying into other companies as well.\n\n◾Frequent reminders of the government's power and role in dominating public life, in part. with monuments and banners dedicated to the leader. Earlier this year, three federal buildings in Washington were festooned with giant images of the president.\n\n◾Lack of free and fair elections, with leaders manipulating the system to remain in power. Trump has pressured several Republican-led states, including Texas, to redistrict to make it easier for Republicans to win seats in Congress. He has also spoken against popular mail-in ballots, saying without evidence that they are ripe for fraud.\n\n◾Using government power to punish or silence opponents and journalists, and declaring them enemies, as Trump has most recently done with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that each one of these actions is necessary and consistent with its Make America Great Again agenda, and that the Biden administration was guilty of many seemingly authoritarian measures, too.\n\nTanks as common as ice cream trucks\n\nFor Eddie Flores, growing up in El Salvador meant seeing military tanks rolling through neighborhoods as often as ice cream trucks. Flores' family fled the country's devastating civil war when he was 7.\n\nLast year, he became the first Salvadoran-born immigrant elected mayor of South San Francisco.\n\nNow, along with balancing the city's biotech cluster and creeping gentrification, he's also helping coordinate neighborhood groups opposed to Trump's mass immigration sweeps. More than a third of the city’s residents are Hispanic, and despite concerns ahead of the city’s popular Cultura Fest in August, no disruptions occurred.\n\nIn the Los Angeles area, Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have swept up thousands of undocumented immigrants, sometimes chasing them through the streets or farm fields. Protests against the ICE raids became violent, and Trump then deployed active-duty Marines and members of the California National Guard onto city streets over the objection of local officials.\n\nTrump has also deployed the National Guard to Washington, DC, and has threatened to unleash his newly renamed \"Department of War\" into Chicago.\n\n\"I constantly tell my staff that we have to remain proactive and have systems in place before any harm arrives,\" Flores said. \"It's about consistently showing up for your neighbors, not just when they are in need, so they don't have to live in the shadows.\"\n\nHe added: \"Authoritarianism has no place in a country built on pluralism, and we as leaders have to safeguard that promise.\"\n\nRecognizing patterns of behavior\n\nFor a 41-year-old immigrant from the Middle East, the United States had long been a bastion of freedoms ‒ a place where the right to criticize the government is written into the nation's founding documents. Several members of his family have been detained in his home country for years for speaking out against their leaders.\n\n\"We came here to express ourselves and have found ourselves in this dilemma that we'd never thought we'd face,\" said the man, who USA TODAY agreed not to identify.\n\nThe man, a legal researcher who lives legally in the United States, is worried he might be targeted by the federal government for speaking freely. \"It's very, very ironic that we now suggest to folks who are visiting us from outside the United States to delete apps, delete text conversations, delete images, even though they are completely innocent.\"\n\nThe man, who is also a human rights expert for a nonprofit, said he's watched in fear as Trump has attacked the rule of law, singled out minority groups for harsh prosecution and declared emergencies or accused people of terrorism to justify some of his actions. He said Americans should heed the warnings of refugees like him who have lived under oppressive regimes and can recognize the patterns playing out.\n\nIt's easy for people in society's mainstream to think what's happening to minority groups will never happen to them, he said, adding that he has been disappointed more Americans haven't been trying to halt Trump, given the country's founding system of checks and balances brought by the courts, Congress and a free press.\n\n\"It's going to reach you at some point, and when it does, there'll be nobody there for you because you were never there for them,\" he said.\n\nEchoing childhood memories\n\nLike many other people who sought safety in the United States, Davis, California, resident Griselda Gonzalez said watching federal troops patrolling Los Angeles conjured up painful childhood memories.\n\nThe Salvadoran native can vividly recall when she was 10, as guerrilla fighters stormed her hometown of San Salvador, the nation’s capital. The complex and brutal civil war in her country killed thousands. Visions of explosions and constant gunfire, even in the smallest neighborhoods, sometimes pop into her head.\n\nToday, she's a married mother of three with a successful family-owned commercial moving company. But she said she's shocked by how much the United States now resembles the country she fled: constant threats of military deployments, along with ICE raids targeting people who look like her.\n\n\"Five years ago, we were all fighting for our lives with COVID-19,\" said Gonzalez, who became a naturalized citizen in 2014. \"Now we're worried about fighting for our basic rights?\"\n\nDone staying quiet\n\nFernandez, the Cuban refugee and American-made billionaire, became a U.S. citizen after serving as an Army paratrooper. He said he's long been content to influence U.S. politics by funding political candidates, most of them Republicans.\n\nBut after watching how Trump and the people around him are behaving ‒ including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom he once strongly supported ‒ Fernandez said he's done staying quiet.\n\nHe has begun funding a pro-immigrant campaign, bought anti-Trump advertisements in newspapers and is preparing to spend his fortune fighting what he sees as creeping authoritarianism and tyranny within the United States.\n\n\"If I go back to zero, I will do so because I came here with nothing and I owe this country to reinvest to defend it from within,\" Fernandez said. \"I think I owe it to the country. I owe it to my children and grandchildren to come back to a place where due process matters.\"\n\nThe American people have more power than they think, Fernandez said.\n\n\"The more we speak as a group, the less likely we are to be targeted. I see myself being targeted already. Will I stop? No,\" he said, encouraging everyone to speak out against what he sees as the president's anti-Americanism.\n\n\"America used to be a great country,\" he added. \"It isn't anymore, in the way it's been designed by the current administration.\"\n\nTrevor Hughes and Terry Collins are National Correspondents at USA TODAY.",

      "headline": "Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI investment raises eyebrows and a key question: How much of the AI boom is just Nvidia’s cash being recycled?",
      "content": "Nvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.\n\nIn past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.\n\nThe extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.\n\nIn addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.\n\nTangled webs of investment\n\nTwo of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently.\n\n\n\nThe benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back.\n\nStartups financing data centers have often had to borrow money at rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% that a large, established corporation such as Microsoft might have to pay. With Nvidia’s backing, OpenAI and Coreweave have been able to borrow at rates closer to what Microsoft or Google might pay.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also signed a $6.3 billion deal to purchase any cloud capacity that CoreWeave can’t sell to others. The chipmaker had previously agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years on cloud computing with CoreWeave. Coreweave, meanwhile, has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs so far—the majority of which it says are H100 Hopper models, which cost about $30,000 each—which means Coreweave has spent about $7.5 billion buying these chips from Nvidia. So in essence, all of the money Nvidia has invested in Coreweave has come back to it in the form of revenue.\n\n\n\nNvidia has struck similar cloud computing deals with other so-called “neo-cloud” companies. According to a story in The Information, Nvidia agreed this summer to spend $1.3 billion over four years renting some 10,000 of its own AI chips from Lambda, which like Coreweave runs data centers, as well as a separate $200 million deal to rent some 8,000 more over an unspecified time period.\n\nFor those who believe there’s an AI bubble, the Lambda deal is clear evidence of froth. Those Nvidia chips Lambda is renting time on back to Nvidia? It bought them with borrowed money collateralized by the value of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\n\nBesides its large investments in OpenAI and Coreweave, AI chipmaker also holds multi-million dollar stakes in several other publicly-traded companies that either purchase its GPUs or work on related chip technology. These include chip design firm Arm, high-performance computing company Applied Digital, cloud services company Nebius Group, and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals. (Nvidia also recently purchased a 4% stake in Intel for $5 billion. Like Arm, Intel makes chips that in some cases are alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, but which for the most part are complementary to them.)\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia also pledged to invest £2 billion ($2.7 billion) in U.K. AI startups, including at least £500 million in Nscale, a U.K.-based data center operator that will, presumably, be using some of that money to purchase Nvidia GPUs to provision the data centers it is building. Nvidia also said it would invest in a number of British startups, both directly and through local venture capital firms, and some of that money too, will likely come back to OpenAI in the form of computing purchases, either directly, or through cloud service providers, who in turn will need to buy Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia invested about $1 billion in AI startups globally either directly or through its corporate venture capital arm NVentures, according to data from Dealroom and The Financial Times. This amount was up significantly from what Nvidia invested in 2022, the year the generative AI boom kicked off with OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nHow much of this money winds up coming right back to Nvidia in the form of sales is again, difficult to determine. Wall Street research firm NewStreet Research has estimated that for every $10 billion Nvidia invests in OpenAI, it will see $35 billion worth of GPU purchases or GPU lease payments, an amount equal to about 27% of its annual revenues last fiscal year.\n\nEchoes of the dotcom era\n\nThat kind of return would certainly make this sort of customer financing worthwhile. But it does raise concerns among analysts about a bubble in AI valuations. These kinds of circular deals have been a hallmark of previous technology bubbles and have often come back to haunt investors.\n\nIn this case, the lease arrangements that Nvidia is entering into with OpenAI as part of its latest investment could prove problematic. By leasing GPUs to OpenAI, rather than requiring them to buy the chips outright, Nvidia is sparing OpenAI from having to take an accounting charge for the high depreciation rates on the chips, which will ultimately help OpenAI’s bottom line. But it means that instead Nvidia will have to bear this depreciation costs. What’s more, Nvidia will also take on the risk of being stuck with an inventory of GPUs no one wants if demand for AI workloads don’t match Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rosy predictions.\n\n\n\nTo some market watchers, Nvidia’s latest deals feel all-too-similar to the excesses of past technology booms. During the dot com bubble at the turn of the 21st Century, telecom equipment makers such as Nortel, Lucent, and Cisco lent money to startups and telecom companies to purchase their equipment. Just before the bubble burst in 2001, the amount of financing Cisco and Nortel had extended to their customers exceeded 10% of annual revenues, and the amount of financing the top five telecom equipment makers had provided to customers exceeded 123% of their combined earnings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the amount of fiber-optic cabling and switching equipment installed far exceeded demand, and when the bubble burst and many of those customers went bust, the telecom equipment makers were left holding the bad debt on their balance sheets. This contributed to a greater loss of value when the bubble burst than would have otherwise been the case, with networking equipment businesses losing more than 90% of their value over the ensuing decade.\n\n\n\nWorse yet were companies such as fiber-optic giant Global Crossing that engaged in direct “revenue roundtripping.” These companies cut deals—often at the end of a quarter in order to hit topline forecasts—in which they paid money to another company for services, and then that company agreed to purchase equipment of exactly equal value. When the bubble burst, Global Crossing went bankrupt, and its executives ultimately paid large legal settlements related to revenue roundtripping.\n\n\n\nIt is memories of these kinds of transactions that have caused analysts to at least raise an eyebrow at some of Nvidia’s circular investments. Goldberg, the Seaport Global analyst, said the deals had a whiff of circular financing and were emblematic of “bubble-like behavior.”\n\n“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note following Nvidia’s announcement of its blockbuster investment in OpenAI. It’s a long way from a concern to a crisis, of course, but as AI company valuations get higher, that distance is starting to close.",

      "content": "The Nvidia logo is displayed on a building at Nvidia headquarters on Aug. 27, 2025 in Santa Clara, California.\n\nDespite macroeconomic uncertainties, several companies are well-positioned to deliver strong returns to investors from rapid technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.\n\nTo pick attractive stocks with strong prospects, investors can track top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on in-depth research and analysis of a company's financials and growth drivers.\n\nHere are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nNvidia\n\nWe start with semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), which has strengthened its dominant position through continued innovation and strategic deals, such as the recently announced $5 billion investment in Intel and massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI.\n\nFollowing a conversation with Nvidia's CFO on the OpenAI deal, Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated a buy rating on NVDA, saying the chip company is the \"AI ecosystem of choice, not just with its CUDA software stack, but also with its connectivity solution, NVLink, which we think is poised to become a de facto standard.\"\n\nThe top-rated analyst increased his price target on Nvidia to $225 from $214 and said that Nvidia remains a top pick for Evercore. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $204.\n\nHighlighting the key takeaways from his conversation with the company's CFO, Lipacis said that Nvidia will be the preferred supplier to OpenAI, adding that the ChatGPT platform has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of future demand. Nvidia is well-positioned to help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout.\n\nLipacis noted that the deal specifies at least 10 GW (gigawatts) of AI infrastructure, and Nvidia management confirmed that, historically, the company's total addressable market (TAM) was $30 billion to $40 billion per GW, although it could increase in the future. The analyst increased his 2026 revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 2% for Nvidia, but thinks that his forecast may be conservative.\n\nLipacis ranks No. 53 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.5%. See Nvidia ETF Exposure on TipRanks.\n\nMongoDB\n\nNext is database management software company MongoDB (MDB). The company recently held a MongoDB.local event in New York City, hosting an Investor Session focused on profitable growth and providing a 3- to 5-year financial framework.\n\nFollowing the event, Needham analyst Mike Cikos reiterated a buy rating on MongoDB and increased his price target to $365 from $325. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MDB stock, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $355.\n\nCikos said that while investors' initial reaction to the high-teens revenue growth forecast was underwhelming, he expects both AI and competitive migrations to drive incremental growth for MongoDB.\n\nThe 5-star analyst noted that management plans to continue investing in the business, though at a slower rate than revenue and gross profit growth. MongoDB's investments will mainly focus on developer awareness, research & development and its sales force.The company has also identified areas for optimization and expects its scale to drive profitable growth through efficiencies.\n\nCikos said that following the MongoDB.local event he is \"incrementally more positive on MongoDB's AI positioning,\" driven by embeddings, which bridge data and Large Language Models (LLMs), and the continued integration of Voyage's best-in-class models.\n\nCikos ranks No. 581 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%. See MongoDB Ownership Structure on TipRanks.",

      "content": "Skip to comments.\n\nObama’s final booby trap\n\nAmerican Thinker ^ | 27 Sep, 2025 | Gerald McGlothlin\n\nPosted on by MtnClimber\n\nIn the final days of the Obama presidency — while Americans were focused on inaugurating a new president and turning the page on a divisive era — President Barack Obama signed a quiet but sweeping executive order that many now see as a ticking time bomb planted in the heart of our Intelligence Community.\n\nOn January 3, 2017, just 17 days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, Obama signed a modification to Executive Order 12333, authorizing the National Security Agency (NSA) to share raw signals intelligence (SIGINT) with all 16 other intelligence agencies — including the FBI, the CIA, and even obscure agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration’s intel wing.\n\nAt face value, the stated purpose was to “streamline intelligence sharing” and “improve coordination” in the age of global terrorism. But conservatives saw something else: a calculated move to weaponize the intelligence apparatus against a political outsider — Donald J. Trump — before he could even take the oath of office.\n\nFrom Terrorism to Trump? The Convenient Shift\n\nPrior to this change, the NSA — which vacuumed up massive amounts of phone calls, emails, texts, and metadata — could share only filtered, “minimized” intelligence with other agencies. That meant masking the names of American citizens incidentally caught up in foreign surveillance.\n\nBut Obama’s executive order reversed that policy, allowing raw, unredacted data — including conversations of U.S. citizens — to be freely distributed across the Intelligence Community. In short, the firewalls were gone. The surveillance spigot was opened.\n\nWhy now? Why not during his eight years in office?\n\nThese are the questions conservatives have been asking ever since.\n\nA Leak Pipeline Disguised as Reform\n\nWithin weeks of the order, classified leaks about members of Trump’s incoming administration began flowing.\n\nThe most prominent example?

General Michael Flynn.\n\n\n\n(Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...\n\nTOPICS:\n\nSociety\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nantichristobama\n\nbarackhusseinobama\n\nlawfare\n\nmuslim\n\nobama\n\nr\n\nspiritofantichrist\n\ntraitor\n\n\n\n\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\nNow it President Trump’s duty to defuse the weaponized government.\n\n\n\nby 2 posted onby MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n“When we’re done he’ll claim Kenyan citizenship as a way to escape.”\n\n\n\nby 3 posted onby C210N (Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur.)\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\nWhere is that meme of jug ears listening to Trump on his super secret headphones?

      "headline": "IBM Intellistation 185 AIX workstation",
      "content": "Released in 2006 after the 285, this system used the PowerPC 970 processors (sometimes erroneously categorized under POWER5 by 3rd parties and at IBM--it would technically be closer to a POWER4). Despite POWER5+ and DDR2 already being used on the 285, the 185 took a few steps back and used DDR1 and didn't bother with the POWER chips. While this may seem rather strange, it can be explained with System p5 185 (7037-A50). Perhaps IBM wanted to create a machine of their own with the PPC 970 or it was stuck in developmental hell for a bit, whatever the case IBM used the 7037 guts to be modified into the IntelliStation 185. This move could have been done to offer a workstation that used less power and was quieter / while still maintaining AIX compatibility. Hundreds went to use in government offices and engineering firms; as a result they mainly show up in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nMost of the POWER and AIX people don't even know that IBM badged the 970 under POWER and popped it into a workstation; therefore making the IntelliStation \"POWER\" 185 a source of confusion, horror and intrigue--and the fact it's relatively unknown means you'll get different responses as to what it can and cannot do. It is still a POWER system in firmware, and supports hardware virtualization like any other POWER system, which makes it completely different from a Power Mac G5 which uses the same CPU. If it didn't support hardware virtualization IBM wouldn't have been able to call the original System p5 185 a System p5... it would just be a plain PowerPC box. But this wasn't too unfamiliar as other AIX systems in the past also leveraged PowerPC chips like RS/6000s and PowerPC ThinkPads. I suspect the whole reason why the PowerPC 970MP had virtualization in the first place was because of IBM's exact requirement for this on their System p5 that they were intending to use it in (which Apple never did on the G5 as far as I know), and then of course Apple wanted AltiVec (which IBM didn't use in AIX as far as I know, but that doesn't mean you couldn't write AIX software to leverage it).\n\nDownloads\n\n--> Latest System Firmware (AT071-156, RPM package) - 05/11/2007\n\nDue to IBM's licensing agreements I am not entitled to distribute the firmware update as it's licensed code.

This is undocumented on the PPC 970MP datasheet and not implemented on anything else as far as I can tell. I'm not exactly sure how this was achieved but it's either a hidden switch on the PPC970MP or a special switch done through firmware. The reason why this was done was to reduce the thermal requirements for a smaller system and smaller heatsink; as a work-around IBM then offered adding a second PowerPC 970MP in the IntelliStation 185 (also running in single-core mode) to simulate a \"dual-core\" PowerPC 970MP setup through two discreet chips instead of one.\n\n7037-A50 or 7047-185, which came first\n\nIt's easy to tell the 7037-A50 came first based on the fact documentation always shows the system with a 7037 bezel instead of the characteristic one present on 7047: even on the IntelliStation POWER 185's service diagram on the metal door. Furthermore based on the timing, where IBM felt they needed a lower-end IntelliStation POWER to complement the already released 285 / why create a system from scratch when the upcoming 7037 design could be used. It gets somewhat interesting because this means the IntelliStation 185's bezel was designed after-the-fact, as a result that's why it is so thick on the front to compensate for the slanting that's characeristic of (most) IntelliStations. However, vendors and IBM constantly mix 7037 and 7047 in stock photos and documentation. The photo below shows a 7037 and you can see how it is inspired by 9228--oh and the bezel is flush against the front:\n\nThe story doesn't end there... System p5 185 sold *so* poorly (and was more work for IBM to support due to the PPC 970 that really should have never been considered p5) that IBM discontinued it a year after its release in 2007, while the IntelliStation 185 continued to be sold until 2009.\n\nDeceptive as a Greyghost (PC Server 500)\n\nThe IntelliStation 185 POWER was aimed towards CAD running under AIX, and had a specific emphasis on quiet operations, as mentioned in the hardware announcement \"A quiet deskside form factor\". Unlike System x and the IntelliStation 9228 (which is based on a System x), these run amazingly quiet for what they are--which begs the question why couldn't have IBM calibrated the cooling of System x like the POWER 185 as the design (internally) is very similar to 9228?* In fact the original external appearance of 7037-A50 could be confused with 9228; so there was some inspiration between the two. A lot of attention was put into the acoustics as the system is lined extensively with foam, unlike the 9228 or even 7382 which hails as one of the poorest 'acoustic' performers and makes a similar sound to an IntelliStation POWER 285. The characteristic front fold baffle is also meant to reduce noise (and is actually a separate piece clipped in to the main bezel: the design would be rather complex to injection mold as a single piece).in).\n\n*I have confirmed System x towers can run fine with noctua fans / of course I suppose System x is not design to reside as a workstation, but still. The servers have thermal sensors so it would be VERY little effort for IBM to calibrate the fans at a slower RPM instead of hard-lining at a higher-than-necessary value--'desktop mode' could even be added to the UEFI. Even worse, the IntelliStation 6225 was never shipped with a rear fan when it's REALLY ideal to have one (else the FSB can get up to 90C), and when a rear fan is installed the controller throttles it down to a few *hundred* RPM. I suppose different engineers were involved with the RPM tuning on 7047-185, 7382, 9228, 9229 and 6225 so I shouldn't be that critical.\n\nHere with the IntelliStation POWER 185 opened up into pieces you can see the foam lining behind the front bezel along with the interior baffles being lined with foam. The foam on the front bezel was actually manually cut near the intake bezel to angle it off:\n\nIt's a workstation not a server\n\nSome mistake the IntelliStation POWER 185 as a \"server\" or try to say that IntelliStation POWERs in general are servers, but it was always meant as an end-user workstation typically involving CAD or industrial design. The correct \"server\" product would be system type 7037-A50, the A50 was modified to perform as a server and not a CAD workstation / and also features some differences supported PCI add-ons. It's still hard to distinguish the two when the workstations are directly derived from the servers.\n\nBy all means you can use an IntelliStation POWER as a server, but then it's being under-utilizing for what it can really do and missing an opportunity for getting the most out of AIX as a \"desktop\" OS. Something which is rarely exhibited with the phasing out of the CAD components the IntelliStations first brought to the table.\n\nUNIX high-end CAD meets its death\n\nWhen the ancients roamed the earth (2006), Dassault Systemes ported CATIA V5 and V6 to AIX, most likely by request from IBM. What's weird about this is that you'll be hard-pressed to find any references to CATIA being run on UNIX now, Dassault completely removed it but there's probably a story behind this as to why. If you go back to the Dassault Systemes website in early 2007, you'll see that they still reference support for Windows and all major flavours of UNIX--but there's one key phrase near the end where they say: \"Dassault Systemes has set up a certification program... (blah blah blah)... since the launch of V5, natively developed on windows NT Platform\". At that point Windows XP 32-bit was the most commonly used variant, and while you could run XP 64-bit (and IBM did have native support for it on the IntelliStation 9228), XP 64-bit had so many problems so most users were stuck with 3.9 GB of RAM. Therefore if we were to assume that UNIX and said UNIX hardware offered way more memory, it starts to make sense (not to mention that the drivers and video cards would be extremely optimized and had features nVidia and ATI didn't offer*--at the time--). This may be even supported further from the POWER 185 RedBook where IBM states: \"The addition of native 64-bit capability brings significant performance enhancements of CATIA V5 and ENOVIA DMU Navigator. Initial benchmarks indicate that for memory-intensive operations, such as analysis of large models, global performance is significantly increased. In addition, improvements to clash analysis greatly reduces processing times for analysis of large assemblies.\" It's also worth pointing out that CATIA predates Windows, so Dassault probably rewrote V5 from scratch on NT.\n\n*HP's HP-UX hardware being an exception since they just sloppily hacked in standard ATI cards / which means you wouldn't get the extra benefits of running a GXT6500 on AIX as you would with a FireGL X3 on HP-UX. HP probably had the lowest share of the UNIX CAD market so they probably felt little need to invest much R&D: not to mention HP can't make a proper enterprise workstation or server ANYWAYS.\n\nWhile the IntelliStation lineup was never involved with the sale of the PC division to Lenovo (and continued to press on for awhile), IBM dropped the x86 IntelliStations in 2006 and the POWER IntelliStations in 2009. Why did IBM bother to dedicate CAD resources to AIX when they were deliberately planning to phase out the platform? As established already, UNIX workstations were 'still a thing' back then and had advantages over the terrible x86 machines at the time (Windows XP with Pentium 4), and it was profitable for IBM (along with HP, SGI and Sun) to manufacture such computers. When x64 Windows 7 rolled by various changes in the market happened alongside it: Sun and SGI went out of business, HP started downsizing and split their enterprise into HPE, and Dassault Systemes dropped support for CAITA on UNIX. The UNIX CAD market had the carpet pulled from underneath and now UNIX was set aside for even more specialized applications.\n\nThe IntelliStation POWER lineup left a few remnants which are still gawked at by users of newer POWER7/8 systems, such as the high-performance CAD GPUs. AIX has never again received high performance video cards / apparently some IBM customers have complained of this, but not enough to warrant development on better AIX graphics cards. As a result, for more realistic graphics performance AIX users continue to use the IntelliStation cards.\n\nThere is a story underneath the death march of AIX workstations, if you look carefully you'll notice the GXT6500P was originaly announced in 2002 (along with the IntelliStation POWER 265). IBM never refreshed any of the GXT135P, GXT4500P and GXT6500P cards, still keeping them as \"current\" offerings for the IntelliStation POWER 185 and 285 . And soon as the last two of the POWER IntelliStations were made, other OEMs stopped making UNIX CAD stations and IBM quietly killed all IntelliStations, only leaving System x and System i behind (of course IBM has now even sold System x off in 2014 after the U.S. government reviewed the case as they used System x servers internally).\n\nPOWER Linux vs AIX on the IntelliStation POWER 185\n\nLet's get it out of the way: many think AIX will be dead soon and stipulate IBM is wanting clients to all mass migrate to POWER Linux (in fact, Watson was even programmed in POWER Linux and not AIX). The truth of the matter is that AIX contains more features that IBM or anyone else does not add in Linux. For instance, going through the RedBooks and Hardware Announcement, the higher-end CAD cards are not supported under Linux, RAS is not supported, the sound card is not supported and it goes on and on. In other words you're not going to use be using Linux for CAD, graphical operations or sound any time soon. While it may 'seem' IBM wants everyone on POWER Linux and not AIX, you can't use it as a workstation operating system unlike AIX.\n\nBecause the IntelliStation POWER 185 uses the aforementioned PowerPC 970, POWER Linux itself has limited support on the system. In the June 23 2009 hardware announcement, IBM confirms that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 has dropped support for the PowerPC 970:\n\n\"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (SLES 11) for POWER supports all POWER5 and POWER6 technology-based systems with the exception of the OpenPower line of servers. It does not support any 970 based systems, which includes JS20, JS21, IBM System p5 185, and the IBM Intellistation POWER 185.\"\n\nWhereas on AIX 7.1 PPC 970 is still supported (note that AIX 7.2 dropped it, but so was the IntelliStation POWER 285):\n\n\"Only 64-bit Common Hardware Reference Platform (CHRP) machines running selected PowerPC 970, POWER4, POWER5, POWER6, and POWER7 processors that implement the POWER architecture Platform Requirements (PAPR) are supported.\"\n\nIt's therefore far more logical to use AIX to get the most out of the IntelliStation's workstation-oriented hardware, since POWER Linux has virtually nothing to offer for graphics support. While AIX and UNIX workstations in general are dead, you won't see such features revisted on newer AIX hardware / and it's *completely* omitted under POWER Linux.\n\nMeanwhile HPE and Intel seem to be having a hard time maintaining their Itanium contracts and want HP-UX to die / whereas AIX and POWER are in a much better position due to IBM's contributions to Linux and (now) OpenPOWER.\n\nOS Support\n\nAIX\n\nAIX 7.2 Not Supported\n\nAIX 5.1 Not Supported\n\nAIX 4.3.3 Not Supported\n\nAIX 4.2.1 Not Supported\n\nAIX 3.2.5 Not Supported\n\nAIX 7.1 SupportedAIX 6.1 SupportedAIX 5.3 SupportedAIX 5.2 Supported\n\nI'm not sure why (some) IBM documentation claims AIX 7.1 is not supported on the IntelliStation POWER 185 when it in fact is (yes! You can in fact run AIX 7.1 on a PowerPC 970 CPU).\n\nWARNING: AIX 7.1 wasn't designed with the System p5 185, or AIX workstations in mind anymore; so if you run AIX 7.1 on a system with a single PSU, you will get the rc.powerfail:2 being generated in the console every so often because AIX 7.1 is looking for a redundant power supply that does not exist. Kind of strange considering the System p5 185 lacks a second power supply as well and was sold as a server rack unit.\n\nPOWER Linux\n\nSUSE Linux Enterprise SLES 9 SP3\n\nRed Hat Enterprise AS4U3\n\n\n\nThe Great Purge of 2016\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense was using a mass horde of IntelliStation POWER 185 units / and much of them have now been tossed back to IBM reselling channels. So, in early 2016 many appeared and obtaining one became a LOT cheaper. The timing is not a coincidence, IBM is phasing out the 185 in mid 2017 so corporate customers are being told to upgrade, or their leases are expiring (requiring a forced upgrade). The fact that some of these computers have been in service for 10 years is an example of how UNIX moves slowly and that the hardware was well built. Unlike other IBM systems, the IntelliStation POWER 185 is uniquely elusive for its age, I don't know if they will continue to drop in price or get more expensive as they reach unobtanium.\n\nIn one of IBM's client case studies, it is explained that they sold the Polish government 400 IntelliStation POWER 185 workstations / so we can assume a similar amount was also sold to the U.S. government (and in other places, too):\n\n\"The organization teamed with IBM Global Technology Services to implement a solution based on IBM Lotus Domino Collaboration Express software and the Lotus software-based iDoc offering from IBM Business Partner Advatech. The IBM staff loaded the new software on the client's fleet of 400 newly purchased IBM IntelliStation(R) POWER(TM) 185 Express workstations.\"\n\nI'm not sure how many of these IntelliStations were sold, maybe a few thousand at best? But if we were to take into consideration that a typical system would probably be around $8,000, times that by four hundred and you're looking at $3.2 million! Later the document explains that operating costs for the client were reduced as a result of using that IBM solution. I suppose in the grand scheme of things they would be--since they probably used them for 10 years / and since the hardware was so robust IBM wouldn't have to do any work on the service agreement.\n\nGPU options and caveats\n\nAs mentioned throughout, the IntelliStation 185 was geared towards CAD design and as such supported GPU options. Here are the three main GPUs that the system supports, it may be possible to run others but I have not tried it:\n\nGXT4500P (FC 2842 - IBM)\n\nGXT6500P (FC 2843 - IBM)\n\nGXT135P (FC 1980 - Matrox)\n\n\n\nThe GXT4500P and GXT6500P are the premier cards designed in-house by IBM; they only run properly on AIX and no Linux support exists. The GXT135P is a rebadged Matrox GT series card and runs under both AIX and Linux, but is far more limited in graphical capabilities. Apparently two GXT4500Ps can be ran in the IntelliStation, however I don't know if this will enable dual-monitor support. Only one GXT6500P can be ran in a system at a time. Up to FOUR GXT135Ps can be stuffed into an IntelliStation, this could theoreitcally allow eight monitors to be connected, however again, that would all depend if AIX could support it.\n\nFirmware options\n\nThe IntelliStation POWER 185 has an array of its own unique firmware options, similar to a BIOS/UEFI on a regular x86 computer. Below is what options you get when selecting to go into the firmware menu upon when the machine first starts up:\n\nMain Menu\n\n\n\n1 Select Language\n\n2 Setup Remote IPL (Initial Program Load)\n\n3 Change SCSI Settings\n\n4 Select Console\n\n5 Select Boot Options\n\n6 Power/Restart Control\n\n7 System Service Aids\n\n8 Set Beep Volume\n\n9 Select Keyboard\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNavigation keys:\n\nM = return to Main Menu N = Next page of list\n\nESC key = return to previous screen X = eXit System Management Services\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nType menu item number and press Enter or select Navigation key\n\n\n\nBasically all of the options are self-explanatory really. I had to change the sound of the system beep since it was WAY too loud on its default setting. I chose 6.\n\nPCI adapter placement\n\nUnlike most computers, the IntelliStation POWER series can be sensitive what adapter is placed where: this is due to the way each slot is tied to the north bridge via the hyper transport tunnels and individual sub PCI bridges. There are a total of four PCI-X slots with a regular 32-bit PCI slot at the very top. Slots 2 & 3 have direct access and operate at 133 Mhz, slots 4 & 5 are shared and operate at 100 Mhz, slot 1 is a regular PCI slot and operates at 33 Mhz. Slot 5 can operate at 133 Mhz but only if slot 4 is empty, otherwise it runs at 100 Mhz.\n\nFeature code (FC) Base unit slot priority 7047-185 max. allowed adapters 2842 (GXT4500P) 2, 3 2 2843 (GXT6500P) 2 1 1954* 2, 3, 5/4 2 5740* 2, 3 2 1984* 2, 3, 5/4 3 5706* 2, 3, 5/4 3 5707* 2, 3, 5/4 3 1983* 2, 3, 5/4 3 1978* 2, 3, 5, 4 4 1979* 2, 3, 5, 4 4 5700* 2, 3, 5, 4 4 5701* 2, 3, 5, 4 4 5759** 2, 3, 5, 4 3 3 1910** 2, 3, 5, 4 3 3 1905* 2, 3, 5, 4 4 5758* 2, 3, 5, 4 4 1986* 2, 3, 5, 4 3 1987* 2, 3, 5, 4 3 5713* 2, 3, 5, 4 3 5714* 2, 3, 5, 4 3 1977, 5716* (Fibre Channel Adapter) 2, 3, 5, 4 1 1912* (Ultra320 LVD SCSI Adapter) 2, 3, 5, 4, 1 4 5736* 2, 3, 5, 4, 1 4 1913* (Ultra320 LVD SCSI RAID Adapter) 2, 3, 5, 4 4 5737* (Disk Controller) 2, 3, 5, 4 4 2849, 1980 (GXT135P) 2, 3, 4, 5 4 2947 (4-Port Multiprotocol Adapter) 4, 5, 3, 2 3 5723 (2-Port asynchronous Serial Adapter) 1, 4, 5, 3, 2 2 2943 (8-Port asynchronous Serial Adapter) 1, 4, 5, 3, 2 2 8244 (Crystal PCI Audio Adapter) 1 1\n\n** Extra-high bandwidth (EHB) adapter.

Since some of these functions are specific to the IntelliStation 185 they're not entirely agnostic to other \"IPL\" systems or mainframes. I've extracted the function help from the IBM knowledgebase below. Quick trivia: the IntelliStation POWER 185's specific control panel has been borrowed and re-used in later POWER systems such as the Power 720 and Power S814, it's funny because not many know of this particular machine, yet parts of it live on, photo of it below.\n\nFunction 01: Display selected system operating mode, IPL speed, and firmware IPL mode\n\nThis function displays the selected system operating mode, speed, and firmware mode for the next IPL on the 7037-A50 server and the 7047-185 workstation.

This function is available in both normal and manual operating mode. This function shows whether any control panel indicators are burned out and whether characters that are displayed in the Function/Data display on the control panel are valid. When you activate this test, all the control panel lights and indicators are lit.\n\n\n\nThe lamp test continues on the system control panel for four minutes. Use this procedure to verify that the lights on the system control panel are working correctly. If you cannot complete these steps, see \"Starting Point for All Problems\" in the Problem Analysis information for your system to start problem analysis.\n\n1. Power on the system.\n\n2. Press the Increment (up) or Decrement (down) buttons on the control panel to display function 04.\n\nPress Enter on the control panel.\n\n3. Do all of the lights and indicators on the system control panel come on?\n\nYes No\n\n-> Exchange the control panel or the replaceable unit that contains the control panel function [system unit backplane (MB1) or tower card (CB1)]. See \"Removal and Installation Procedures\" in the Problem Analysis information for your system.\n\n4. Do the expansion unit control panel lights all come on?\n\nYes No\n\n-> Exchange the control panel on the expansion unit.\n\n\n\nThe lights on the system control panel are working correctly. This ends the procedure.\n\nFunction 05: Remind mode\n\nThis function allows you to place the system fault-indicator LED in remind mode on the 7037-A50 server and the 7047-185 workstation. This function is available in both normal and manual operating mode.\n\n\n\nWhen the system fault-indicator LED is on solid, an error condition exists on the system. If you want to defer the repair of the error, you can place the system fault-indicator LED in remind mode. Placing the system in remind mode causes the system fault-indicator LED to flash instead of being on solid. The remind mode lets you know that a system fault that you have deferred still exists on the system. If any other serviceable event occurs on the system, the remind mode is changed back to system fault mode, where the LED is on solid.\n\nFunction/Data Action or description 0 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nUse the Increment or Decrement buttons to scroll to function 05.

      "headline": "More and more family adventure campers are looking beyond the tent",
      "content": "Camping, in all its modern manifestations, has become an increasingly popular and affordable go-to strategy for families eager to get outside and enjoy meaningful time together.\n\nIf you are inclined to camp with the kids, here are five ideas to consider.\n\nHang out in Huttopia\n\nFor an affordable and fun family outing, check out Huttopia’s eight “ready to camp” locations in the U.S. and Canada. Each inspired destination offers a stunning setting and unique accommodations. You’ll find traditional tents or a tiny house. Some offer wood-structured, glamping-style tents or cozy cabins, each with a kitchenette, making it simple to manage varied snack or snoozing schedules. No need to shop for gear ahead of your visit as tents, cooking utensils, sleeping bags and more will be awaiting your arrival. Your job is simply to settle in and revive in a nature-centric setting. Look forward to pool, pond, lake or river swimming (depending on location), paddling, hiking, star-gazing and special activities for the younger set that might include nature art, magic shows, concerts or candle-making.\n\nThe most recent additions to the Huttopia clan include properties in the Berkshires of Massachusetts and in the Quebec wilderness, 90 minutes outside Montreal.\n\nFor more: www.huttopia.com\n\nDiscover state park possibilities\n\nMany state parks provide affordable and accessible lodging where families can enjoy a relaxing getaway in a natural environment. For example, in Ohio’s Deer Creek State Park, your crew can check in to what was once the private hideaway of President Warren G. Harding. The restored, yet rustic multilevel cabin reportedly served as a getaway for Harding and his close circle of friends known as the “Ohio Gang.” Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the cabin was constructed on the banks of Deer Creek by U.S. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty at the close of World War I.\n\nWith a full-length screened porch overlooking the 1,277-acre lake, it’s easy to imagine why Harding might have retreated to the picturesque spot to gain a little perspective.\n\nFor more: www.deercreekstateparklodge.com\n\nSleep in a yurt\n\nIt’s fun to spend the night in a better-than-ordinary kind of space. Increasingly popular, yurts, a Mongolian original, fit the bill. At the Snow Mountain Ranch at the YMCA in Winter Park, Colorado, your family can snooze the night away in a yurt featuring one queen bed and two sets of bunk beds, accommodating up to six people. An outdoor tent pad enables you to expand the party by adding another two persons (guests must bring their own tents).\n\nThe yurts also include a microwave, mini fridge, prep table, picnic table, outdoor grill and fire ring. All yurts offer electricity and complimentary Wi-Fi. The bathhouse, located nearby, has flush toilets, handicapped-accessible hot showers, hair dryers, a coin-operated washer and dryer, and deep well sinks. Yurts are available year-round and are pet friendly.\n\nFor more: www.ymcarockies.org\n\nConnect at the campground\n\nKOA, the world’s largest system of open-to-the-public family campgrounds, has continued to evolve since its inception in 1962. Choose your camping style and destination from more than 500 locations in North America and access tent sites, RV hookups, cabins, teepees, playgrounds, pools and a range of recreational facilities. Many locations are pet friendly.\n\nFor more: www.koa.com\n\nThere’s no place like home\n\nFamily camping can help stir a deep and lifelong interest in the natural world. Therefore, early, positive experiences matter. Talk through the details and set clear expectations. For the youngest set, consider a practice round in the backyard or nearby park.\n\nPut up the tent, toast marshmallows for s’mores and tell not-so-scary stories. That way, if the weather or unforeseen forces create a kink in your plans, warm and dry shelter is nearby.\n\nLynn O’Rourke Hayes (LOHayes.com) is an author, family travel expert and enthusiastic explorer.

      "headline": "TSMC says Intel didn’t ask for investments — denies existence of talks for partnership, joint venture",
      "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) has denied engaging in talks with Intel regarding any sort of investment or partnership. According to the Taipei Times, the company disputed a recent Wall Street Journal report saying that Intel solicited a joint venture with the fab. The WSJ news, based on the publications' sources, also indicated that Intel was reaching out to Apple to explore ways in which these tech companies can collaborate. All this comes close on the heels of Nvidia buying $5 billion worth of Intel stock, alongside the announcement of a joint development of an x86 RTX SOC.\n\nThere have previously been reports of an Intel and TSMC partnership, but the latter has always denied this. The embattled Intel, whose shaky financial situation was revealed last year, has been on the hunt for partners and investors recently. Just last month, SoftBank invested $2 billion in the company, while the U.S. government released the remaining $5.7 billion it had yet to receive from its CHIPS and Science Act grant in exchange for a 10% stake.\n\nThis massive cash inflow is crucial for the company, allowing it to increase spending on investments and capital expenditure. Aside from that, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been slashing costs, including reducing the company’s workforce by over 12,000 personnel — effectively gutting its personnel numbers by around 20%. He also divested some divisions, choosing to focus the company on its core competencies.\n\nDespite all this, Intel still has a long way to go before it can get back in the green. It has long been working on its next-generation chips, but has had trouble with the yield of its 18A node. Tan also said that the company might cancel the Intel 14A and its following leading-edge nodes if it cannot win a big customer for these products. Aside from that, the company projects that its foundry business won’t break even until 2027, which will coincide with the arrival of 14A — if that ever happens.\n\nIntel has also been facing issues on the consumer side. Analysts say that uptake of the company’s Lunar Lake processors has been slow, particularly because buyers aren’t interested in AI chips. The company is even raising prices of its last-generation Raptor Lake processors because of increased demand for the “outdated” chip.\n\nThese complications might be a big reason why TSMC does not want to entangle itself with Intel’s affairs. More than that, it likely doesn’t want to work with a chipmaker with its own foundry, which could potentially be a competitor. And unless it gets massive upside, whether in technology or geopolitics, it’s unlikely that we’ll see any sort of investment or strategic partnership between these two companies.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

(WCCFTech)\n\n\n\nChips take a good six months to make it from production start to consumer devices on store shelves, so expect these to appear in laptops in late Q3 next year.\n\n\n\nPanther Lake will offer up to 4 performance cores, which is... Not a lot. They will pair these with up to 8 efficiency cores and 4 low-power cores, but at the moment all the models except the fastest are looking pretty anemic.\n\n\n\nTech News\n\n\n\nAMD's Strix Halo CPU has a 40 core graphics chip paired with two much smaller 8 core CPU chiplets. But those 8 core chiplets are different from the 8 core chiplets used in all socket AM4 and AM5 CPUs. (WCCFTech)\n\n\n\nAll multi-die AMD CPUs use Infinity Fabric over a high-speed serial link to wire things together. This limits the memory bandwidth for a single consumer CPU chiplet to a fair bit less than fast DDR5 RAM can offer.\n\n\n\nExcept for Strix Halo, where the 16 CPU cores have twice the write bandwidth of a 16 core 9950X.\n\n\n\nThat's because it doesn't a serial bus of any kind to connect the chiplets; the CPU dies are placed directly adjacent to the GPU die and the gap is bridged by a direct parallel connection over an advanced multilayer substrate from TSMC.\n\n\n\nWe'll have to wait and see what happens with Zen 6 next year, but it's interesting that AMD was willing to spend the money on a different CPU chiplet just for Strix Halo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll multi-die AMD CPUs use Infinity Fabric over a high-speed serial link to wire things together.

      "headline": "Watch These Intel Price Levels After Stock Surged 20% Last Week",
      "content": "Key Takeaways Intel shares remain in the spotlight after soaring 20% last week, boosted by reports the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nSince breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, the stock has continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week.\n\nInvestors should watch critical overhead areas on Intel's chart around $45 and $56, while also monitoring major support levels near $30 and $26.\n\nIntel (INTC) shares remain in the spotlight after soaring last week amid investor optimism that the embattled chipmaker could secure additional investments.\n\nThe stock gained 20% last week and has risen more than 40% since the start of the month, boosted recently by reports that the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Intel earlier this month receiving a $5 billion pledge from AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), which came not long after the U.S. government announced it had taken a 10% stake in the company.\n\nAnalysts say they anticipate new developments on the investment front spurring more gains for the stock in the near term, though cautioned they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals. Intel shares were down 4% at around $34 in the opening minutes of Monday's session.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and identify critical price levels worth monitoring.\n\nMulti-Month Trading Range Breakout\n\nSince breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, Intel shares have continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week.\n\nImportantly, the stock’s recent advance has occurred on above-average trading volume, raising the prospect of follow-through buying.\n\nMeanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory near a reading that marked local tops in the stock in January 2020 and December 2023.\n\nLet’s identify major overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares keep climbing and also point out support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements.\n\nCritical Overhead Areas to Watch\n\nThe first overhead area to watch sits around $45. This location may provide resistance near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart stretching all the way back to May 2019. This level also roughly coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level when applying a grid from the December 2023 high to the lower trendline of the stock’s multi-month trading range.\n\nA successful close above this critical level could trigger a rally toward $56. Investors who have accumulated shares at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region near a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between October 2019 and January 2022.\n\nMajor Support Levels to Monitor\n\nDuring retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $30 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this location near several countertrend highs in late 2022 and early 2023, which also closely align with a sideways trend on the chart from May to July last year.\n\nFinally, a deeper pullback in Intel shares may see a retest of major support around $26. This area on the chart marks the top of the stock's multi-month trading range and could flip from prior resistance into future support.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

      "headline": "Want to be CEO? These 5 employers give you the best shot",
      "content": "If your career goal is the corner office, history suggests five employers give you the best odds. McKinsey tops the list, with 18 of today’s Fortune 500 chiefs wearing its alumni badge. General Electric and PepsiCo follow with 15 each, trailed by Procter & Gamble with 11 and JPMorgan Chase with 10.\n\nFor decades, these organizations have served as corporate academies, renowned for their rigorous leadership training and development. In essence, they’ve operated as high-intensity finishing schools.\n\nAt McKinsey, recruits rotate across industries and geographies, dissecting sprawling problems and creating and defending solutions before skeptical executives. General Electric built its reputation on world-class management programs that groomed future chiefs through exacting operating roles. PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble are known for giving young managers full P&L responsibility early and demanding sharp marketing instincts. JPMorgan Chase exposes rising leaders to complex global markets, risk management, and high-stakes client relationships.\n\nEach environment has historically forced ambitious talent to build range, master financial discipline, and develop the judgment boards look for when filling the top job.\n\nOf course, past performance is no guarantee of future dominance. And with the advent of AI, the very factors that once made these companies reliable CEO factories are shifting.\n\n“The value of traditional backgrounds hasn’t been discarded,” says Christine Greybe, president of leadership consulting at DHR Global. “But it’s being supplemented by more progressive, digital-first thinking.”\n\nBoards now prize leaders who can operationalize AI, manage its risks, and weave data into core strategy. Chief product and data officers, along with executives who have driven large-scale digital transformations, are increasingly landing on CEO shortlists.\n\nAI also threatens the old apprenticeship model itself. At firms like McKinsey, the analytical grind that once built leadership muscle—benchmarking, research synthesis, even presentation work—is rapidly automated. And as technology reshapes every industry, companies such as Amazon and Microsoft are becoming prime hunting grounds for boards seeking digital fluency at the top, several executive recruiters told me in private conversations.\n\nTo be sure, the pedigrees of McKinsey, GE, PepsiCo, P&G, and JPMorgan still carry weight, but tomorrow’s chiefs will need more than classic strategy and P&L discipline. They will have to pair those fundamentals with product sense, data literacy, and comfort managing AI-driven change. For ambitious professionals, these storied academies remain powerful launchpads, provided they’re matched with experiences suited to a business world being rewritten by technology.\n\nREAD: How McKinsey built an empire of influence and filled the world’s corner offices with its own\n\nRuth Umoh\n\nruth.umoh@fortune.com\n\nSmarter in seconds\n\nAgility advantage.

      "headline": "Scouting the long-snapper: Intel helped Bears block Raiders' kick, flip script on wild win",
      "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nLAS VEGAS -- As the Las Vegas Raiders lined up for a 54-yard field goal attempt with 38 seconds remaining Sunday, trailing 25-24, Chicago Bears cornerback Josh Blackwell leaned on the intel he received from his teammate, Scott Daly.\n\nDaly, the Bears long-snapper, gave a player report during the week on the Raiders' field goal unit and disclosed a tendency he spotted on film. It appeared subtle, but Las Vegas long-snapper Jacob Bobenmoyer would sometimes move the ball before snapping it on point-after attempts and field goals. Blackwell knew if he saw it in the game, he could get a jump on the snap and have a chance to block a kick.\n\nThis tiny detail paid off in a big way when Blackwell burst off the left edge and dove to block Daniel Carlson's 54-yard field goal attempt, securing the Bears' wild win.\n\n\"It's an incredible win, and that's just a testament to the team we have,\" Blackwell said. \"I think we stacked a good week of practice and we kind of got this quote-unquote monkey off our back that we're not the 'same old Bears', we're different.\"\n\nInstead of going back to Chicago on the familiar end of a heartbreaking loss and with a losing record, the Bears (2-2) head into their Week 5 bye encouraged.\n\nSince he arrived in Chicago in 2022, Blackwell has been part of his fair share of losses that resembled how the Raiders felt on Sunday. He's experienced failure to close out a game because of missed opportunities and gut-wrenching losses being cemented on the final play.\n\nThat was the theme of the 2024 season for the Bears, from a tipped Hail Mary in Washington to a blocked field goal against the Packers to letting the clock run out in Detroit with a chance to win.\n\nBears cornerback Josh Blackwell saw the Raiders move the ball slightly before the snap and relied on his pregame intel in timing his rush. It worked with a game-saving blocked kick. AP Photo/John Locher\n\nRewriting the narrative around their ability to close out opponents amid in-game struggles is a central theme to the changes taking place under first-year Bears coach Ben Johnson.\n\n\"I'm proud of our guys,\" Johnson said. \"They came through for us. We're building something special here, and I think they're feeling it, just the belief they have in each other, the belief they have in this coaching staff, I thought it really showed through.\n\n\"This is a huge win for our team, finding a way in the fourth quarter to come out on top. I just thought that was outstanding for us.\"\n\nThe Bears' offense was stuck in a rut until halftime. Quarterback Caleb Williams was 2-for-7 with an interception in the first quarter while averaging 1.6 yards per attempt. Chicago's defense came away with two interceptions and recovered a fumble, yet the offense generated six points off two field goals.\n\nPre-snap penalties -- six of them on offense -- continued to stifle momentum. The run game netted just 2 yards in the first half. Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby ran through Chicago's offensive line from multiple spots and terrorized Williams when he made his way into the backfield.\n\n\"It's easy to get frustrated, but we don't panic,\" Johnson said. \"I could see where the defense would get frustrated with the offense, and the offense frustrated with ourselves. That didn't happen. Everybody stayed the course, no one panicked whatsoever.\n\n\"I thought we came in at halftime and we hit that reset button. That's what we talked about, take a deep breath, and let's come out and play for 30 minutes and find a way to win.\"\n\nWilliams completed 20 of his 30 pass attempts after a rough first quarter. After failing to connect with Rome Odunze in the first half, Williams sent a 27-yard pass over the middle of the field to his top wideout on Chicago's first possession of the third quarter. The touchdown pass wrested back the lead for the Bears and sparked a back-and-forth battle.\n\nThe Bears defense came away with four turnovers, a bright spot on a day when they let Raiders running back Ashton Jeanty explode onto the scene with a 3-touchdown day while Vegas racked up 240 rushing yards.\n\nOn the Raiders' second-to-last possession, deep in Chicago territory, the Bears held them to a field goal.\n\nAs Williams and the offense got ready to take the field, Johnson shared a moment of encouragement.\n\n\"I remember talking to Caleb before he took the field,\" Johnson said. \"I said, 'This is what you're built for', and these are the moments that he thrives in the most.\n\n\"I think that's really been the story of his life, to be honest with you and I know he came through for us in a big way.\"\n\nWilliams strung together an 11-play, 69-yard game-winning drive, and running back D'Andre Swift -- despite a disastrous day on the ground -- found the end zone on a 2-yard run to give the Bears the go-ahead touchdown.\n\nAs Swift put his fingers up to his lips to silence the home-team crowd in a stadium overrun by Bears fans, the veteran back felt the shift that was taking place.\n\n\"Maybe the good luck is on our side this time going around,\" Swift said.\n\nChicago has plenty to sort through during its bye week self-scout. Whether Braxton Jones will come back as the left tackle in Washington in Week 6 after being pulled before halftime in Las Vegas is one of the biggest decisions Johnson will have to make. Figuring out ways to build consistency on offense is multifaceted, from eliminating penalties to finding effective ways to establish the run.\n\nBut for now, Johnson's proof of concept seems to be paying off. The Bears aren't following the same script that played out a year ago when ugly games led to predictable losses in devastating fashion. Taking a rough day at the office and coming away with a \"grimy\" win proved something to Williams.\n\n\"I think being able to portray the belief that, 'Guys, this is all we got, it's all we need. We're not in a favorable position,'\" Williams said. \"We're down. It's all 11 of us on the field, and we got to go do a job. The belief, the trust, the hard work that we put in, those are the moments that you wish for. Those are moments that you dream about. So, being able to have those moments and come through is important, for one, the confidence. Especially in the moment where it's not a favorable position. You're away, you're down, you got to go win the game.\n\n\"So, it's a confidence builder, it's a culture builder for us.\"",

      "headline": "Analog in-memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and Energy-efficient Large Language Models",
      "content": "A Nature paper describes an innovative analog in-memory computing (IMC) architecture tailored for the attention mechanism in large language models (LLMs). They want to drastically reduce latency and energy consumption during inference. The design leverages gain-cell crossbar arrays—capacitor-based memory devices made from oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (IGZO or ITO)—to store key (K) and value (V) projections from the KV cache directly in memory. This enables simultaneous storage and computation of dot products with query (Q) projections in the analog domain. It avoids the energy-hungry data movement between memory and processors typical in digital systems like GPUs.\n\nAnalog Computation is done via dot products performed via charge-to-pulse circuits that convert stored charges into pulse-width modulated signals, avoiding power-intensive analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Activation uses a hardware-friendly HardSigmoid function (approximating softmax) for sliding window attention, supporting causal and local processing.\n\nHardware-Aware Training: Pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-2) are fine-tuned with scaling factors to account for non-idealities like capacitor leakage and gain-cell nonlinearity, ensuring minimal accuracy loss.\n\nImplementation Details: The system supports sub-tiling for large dimensions, non-destructive reads, and 3D stacking for density. Simulations model real-world effects using third-order polynomials.\n\nFor a single attention head in GPT-2, it achieves 65 ns latency and 6.1 nJ energy per token, yielding up to 7,000× speedup and 90,000× energy reduction compared to NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Area efficiency is high, with KV cache footprints as low as 3.1 × 10⁻³ mm² using 3D integration. On NLP benchmarks (ARC-Easy, WinoGrande, WikiText-2), adapted models match or closely approach baseline perplexity and task accuracies, with minor gaps in larger networks attributable to training differences.\n\nThe authors emphasize co-optimization of hardware and algorithms as key to overcoming analog non-idealities, positioning this as a scalable path for generative AI. Limitations include reliance on emerging OSFETs (still maturing for mass production) and potential scaling challenges for ultra-large models without further tiling optimizations. Future work suggests hybrid integrations with other IMC techniques for full transformers.\n\nThey are going at the main area of energy usage for LLM which is the attention mechanism’s bottleneck of data transfer overheads in KV caching and softmax computations. These use ~70-80% of LLM inference energy in digital accelerators. By shifting to analog IMC with volatile, low-power gain cells, it exploits physics-level parallelism (crossbar matrix multiplications) for near-memory processing, achieving orders-of-magnitude gains without sacrificing much accuracy. The hardware-aware adaptation is a clever bridge, using simple statistical matching to detune ideal models for real circuits, making it practical for deployment.\n\nThe 90,000× energy win is huge. It is driven by eliminating von Neumann bottlenecks and even conservative estimates (factoring in leakage) still shows 10,000×+ gains.\n\n3D stacking and sub-tiling make it viable for billion-parameter models like Mistral 7B.\n\nHardSigmoid simplifies analog operations while preserving sliding window efficacy. It does not require a full softmax redesign.\n\nAll of the major LLMs ( OpenAI GPT 5, XAI Grok, Google Deepmind Gemini, Anthropic Claude) can adopt. It will require chip fabrication (TSMC, Intel or Samsung for OSFETs). The paper’s simulations suggest drop-in compatibility, potentially unlocking exaflop-scale efficiency for these trillion-parameter behemoths.\n\nWork by TSMC or Other Chip Makers on Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC)\n\nThe authors are from Forschungszentrum Jülich and RWTH Aachen University in Germany—not affiliated with the queried companies. Simulations in the paper demonstrate viability for a 1.5B-parameter LLM, but it’s conceptual/prototype-level, not production-ready.\n\nTSMC has ongoing research in analog non-volatile Compute-in-Memory (nvCIM) technologies, which overlap with AIMC principles for AI acceleration. Their work focuses on tradeoffs in signal margins, accumulation cycles, and latency for embedded ferroelectric memory array computing (EFMAC), but not explicitly on attention mechanisms for LLMs. No direct TSMC involvement in the specific gain-cell-based attention design.\n\nChip makers show tangential progress\n\nIBM: Actively advancing AIMC for transformer models, including attention layers in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Their chips integrate memory and computation to cut energy/latency costs, outperforming GPUs in edge AI scenarios. A January 2025 IBM Research blog highlights AIMC’s suitability for accelerating attention in MoE models, with prototypes showing noise-resilient rescaling for LLMs.\n\nSynopsys is Developing AI-powered tools for analog circuit design in AIMC, emphasizing simulation complexity reduction to speed up development. This supports broader AIMC innovation but isn’t LLM-specific.\n\nEmerging players like Mythic or Aspinity explore AIMC for edge AI, but nothing ties directly to LLM attention. Commercial AIMC remains in prototype/trial stages, with no widespread adoption yet.\n\nAIMC for LLM attention is in early research (2024-2025 papers), with prototypes demonstrating feasibility but facing challenges like noise sensitivity, precision limits, and scaling to billion-parameter models.\n\nDevelopment Timeline: How Quickly Could It Be Done?\n\nAIMC prototypes demonstrate feasibility but facing challenges like noise sensitivity, precision limits, and scaling to billion-parameter models.\n\nPrototypes/Validation for 6-18 months. Gain-cell designs are CMOS-compatible, leveraging existing fabs, so small-scale chips could be taped out quickly via multi-project wafers (MPWs).\n\nCommercial Production seem like 2-4 years. Analog noise and yield issues slow scaling; IBM’s work suggests MoE integration by 2027.\n\nFull LLM deployment (inference at scale) might hit 2028-2030, per industry trends.\n\nPartnerships with fabs like TSMC could shave 6-12 months. Open-source simulations enable faster iteration.\n\nHypothetically an aggressive player like Elon and XAI could compress a rollout tp 12-24 months for a proof-of-concept cluster. This would need heavy investment in custom silicon—similar to Tesla’s Dojo.\n\nA plan would be parallel experimentation over sequential caution.\n\nParallel Pilots in Non-Core Sites (0-3 Months): Dedicate a small, isolated cluster (10-50 MW) for AIMC prototypes. Train/infer a subset of Grok workloads (7B-70B params) on hybrid racks: 80% NVIDIA GPUs for baseline, 20% AIMC for attention layers. Use containerized orchestration (Kubernetes + Ray) for seamless A/B switching.\n\nPhased Retrofit with Shadow Testing (3-6 Months): In Memphis, insert AIMC pods as shadow compute—run inference in parallel to GPUs, comparing outputs/latency/energy via canary deployments. Monitor with Prometheus/Grafana for drift (e.g., <1% accuracy loss from analog noise). Scale to 10% of pods if KPIs hit (50x energy savings on attention). Bold Scale-Up with Rollback (6-12 Months), if the early tests work. Maybe try 50% Memphis retrofit by Q2 2026. Use xAI's vertical integration (custom PCBs via Tesla supply chain) for rapid fab-to-rack. Test via chaos engineering (inject failures) and user-facing betas (Grok API endpoints). Fallback: Auto-route traffic to GPU backups if >0.1% SLA hit.\n\nRisk Mitigation: Multi-site redundancy ensures <1% downtime. Start with open-source AIMC sims for software validation before hardware. Total cost: $100-500M, offset by 2-5x efficiency gains. Tesla AI5 Softmax Efficiency Improvements\n\nTesla’s AI5 chip (aka HW5 or next-generation Full Self-Driving computer) introduces significant optimizations for inference workloads, particularly targeting the softmax function—a key component in transformer-based models for normalizing probabilities during attention mechanisms. This aligns with Tesla’s focus on accelerating AI for autonomous driving, Optimus robots, and potentially broader applications like xAI’s Grok models.\n\nElon Musk confirrmed a 40x improvement in softmax performance compared to the AI4 chip. On AI4, softmax was emulated in software via a 40-step process on the CPU, creating a major bottleneck. AI5 implements softmax natively in hardware as a single (or few-step) operation directly in silicon, drastically reducing latency and compute overhead. This is part of broader gains: 8x raw compute, 9x memory, 5x bandwidth, and up to 500-5,000 TOPS overall.\n\nThe softmax optimizations in AI5 do not include Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC) changes. The improvements are achieved through digital hardware acceleration—specifically, co-designing the chip’s silicon to handle softmax operations natively, integrated tightly with Tesla’s software stack for FSD and Optimus. This is a conventional ASIC-style enhancement, not analog in-memory techniques, which would involve performing computations\n\ndirectly within analog memory arrays to minimize data movement and power use. Tesla’s descriptions emphasize “moving core operations into silicon” without any reference to analog paradigms, noise-resilient analog circuits, or in-memory compute for attention/softmax.\n\nAI6 Designs\n\nAI6 is still being designed. AI6 is said to be a bold gamble on semiconductor physics. It could be a logical entry point for prototyping, given its training-inference hybrid nature.",

      "content": "A new set of patches has hit the \"coreboot\" project, an open-source UEFI/BIOS alternative, adding another Intel \"Panther Lake\" stepping to our portfolio of leaks. This time, it is the PTL_B0_3 C06C3 stepping, a new version Intel could be preparing for shipment to clients. Silicon revisions typically begin at A0 and increment as the design evolves. It is rare to see any silicon shipping with the A0 stepping, as later modifications and refinements are made to meet the original specification. Hence, this B0 stepping indicates that this is likely the final revision Intel has prepared for Panther Lake, which is expected to start shipping by the end of 2025, with more SKUs in 2026.As a reminder, the low-power PTL-U models are designed for a 15 W TDP and are expected to come in 6-core and 8-core versions. Some SKUs will feature four high-performance P-cores paired with four LPE-cores, while others will have only two LPE-cores complementing four P-cores. Both families will utilize Xe3-based integrated graphics, with entry models featuring four GPU cores. The more powerful PTL-H line will scale up to around 16 CPU cores, comprising four P-Cores, eight E-cores, and four LPE-cores. Some H-series parts might include up to 12 GPU Xe3 cores for integrated graphics, but the final configurations will be revealed when Intel officially launches the Panther Lake product family.",

      "content": "We recently published Analysts Are Talking About These 10 Stocks as AI Investments Continue to Grow. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.\n\nIn December last year, Joseph Moore, Morgan Stanley semiconductor analyst, commented on the volatility NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) was going through at the time and said the stock would have a strong second half of 2025. The analyst’s call turned out to be correct. Here is what he said at the time:\n\n“I still think when you think about 2025 and AI the story is Blackwell, the product cycle that Nvidia has. I think they’re going to have a huge second half of the year and I think we do have these transitional issues as we’re moving there but I think the stock is very attractive this level. I’m not going to say absolute bottom because it’s volatile but you know it’s very attractive at this level. I think you’re trading at a much lower multiple than some of the AI peers and I really believe that they actually gain share versus custom silicon in 2025. I’m very excited for this custom silicon trend but I still think Nvidia can gain share relative to that in 2025.”\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are up 28% so far this year.\n\nNvidia’s latest deal with OpenAI and Intel, along with Oracle’s partnership with OpenAI are showing signs that companies are continuing to spend a fortune on compute, and AI demand won’t slow down anytime soon. But can NVDA shares keep gaining?\n\nNvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.\n\nWith its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.\n\nNvidia recently impressed the market by signing an AI infrastructure deal with Intel. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel. Jensen Huang said the deal would open up $50B in TAM for both companies in the data center and PC business.\n\nMacquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:",

      "content": "US stocks edged higher on Monday as investors eyed a looming US government shutdown that risks delaying the release of the all-important monthly jobs report later in the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.5%, with the two gauges building on Friday's rebound. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose almost 0.2%.\n\nMarkets are assessing the odds of a US government shutdown on Wednesday this week, as a standoff between Republicans and Democrats goes down to the wire. Trump set a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday, likely the last hope of avoiding a halt to federal funding. Odds of a shutdown are near 80%, according to Polymarket.\n\nThe Department of Labor on Monday said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases key economic data, including Friday's planned monthly jobs report, will \"suspend all operations.\"\n\n\"Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released,\" the department said as part of a shutdown contingency plan.\n\nThe BLS's monthly job updates, as well as its release of consumer and producer inflation reports, have been key to the Federal Reserve's policy setting and the bets on interest rate cuts that have helped buoy stocks.\n\nLast week, jobless claims fell short and GDP growth was revised higher, fueling speculation that the Fed may not cut rates as aggressively as hoped. That puts even more weight on the jobs report, amid forecasts that nonfarm payrolls grew 43,000 and the unemployment rate stayed at 4.3% for the month.\n\nAt the same time, investors are regrouping after a losing week that saw cracks emerge in AI-focused stock trading as well as surprise tariff announcements from President Trump for Oct. 1.

Carbon at its heart is a lightweight, dynamic and innovative c++ library, developed from the ground up by our UK based team without relying on any third party libraries aside from Intel TBB. Which means you can easily and quickly integrate Carbon into any c++ based application, no hoops – no headaches.\n\nWe have created commercial Maya and Houdini plugins, but also integrated into UE5 and Unity for custom projects. Some of our customers brought Carbon into their own plugins in applications like UE5 and Rhino.\n\nQuality and Performance\n\nCarbon Cloth uses an advanced cloth model to deliver high quality cloth simulation which combined with robust multi-layer collision, supports the very highest quality Hero cloth simulation. Highly optimized code combined with a multi-threaded design from the ground up, ensures that Carbon delivers high quality with maximum performance.\n\nCarbon Cloth is production proven for simulation of clothing, ropes, sails, nets, and deformable skin.\n\nToday, Carbon Cloth is used by many large and small studios, around the world.\n\nRobust Collision handling\n\nCarbon Cloth provides very advanced collision and can handle collision between fast moving objects with ease.\n\nThe Carbon Cloth collision supports action AND reaction between:\n\nCloth and Character\n\nCloth and Cloth as layers\n\nCloth and Cloth as self collision within one cloth\n\nCloth and Rigid Bodies like buttons, chains etc.\n\nCloth and Character skin (where character skin is also a Carbon Morph)\n\n\n\nhttps://rg.to/file/d0d576e77f6b37731321f83c919088a8/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part1.rar.html https://rg.to/file/baaece03d750270ca792ca8006e1f627/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part2.rar.html https://rg.to/file/865fe1786102cab16d5d3c6eb898872a/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part3.rar.html https://rg.to/file/3a8038863293f0f61985ec67820db56c/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part4.rar.html\n\nhttps://alfafile.net/file/A3wsE https://alfafile.net/file/A3ws7 https://alfafile.net/file/A3wsm https://alfafile.net/file/A3wsb\n\nhttps://nitroflare.com/view/A7DF2765DA46C43/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part1.rar https://nitroflare.com/view/300CDE05D53E018/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part2.rar https://nitroflare.com/view/E9D4DB031D7F90D/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part3.rar https://nitroflare.com/view/6FD992BA947A8F9/NumerionCarbon3.0.1Maya2023-2026Win.part4.rar",
