Others worried cash-strapped startups would be most severely affected, or that the executive order could counterintuitively push more jobs out of the country.\n\nBusiness Insider examined publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to track which tech companies had the most H-1B visa approvals in 2025.\n\nBloomberg, Intel, and Nvidia declined to comment.

The first phase, one gigawatt, is scheduled for the second half of 2026 on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform, named for the late dark-matter astronomer.

Top AI labs like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic frequently talk about this specific topic, especially when unveiling new products and features that cause a demand surge.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to keep up with this trend, NVIDIA recently announced its plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The strategic partnership will allow the ChatGPT maker to build at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters, which will help train and run next-gen AI models and even potentially create the path toward superintelligence.\n\nIt's worth noting that the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems is set to be deployed in the second half of 2026 on the Nvidia Vera Rubin platform. The chipmaker's first $10 billion investment in OpenAI will be made once both parties reach an agreement for OpenAI to purchase NVIDIA chips. However, reports suggest that NVIDIA's first $10 billion investment will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed.\n\nWhile making the announcement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated:\n\n“Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”\n\nAt the beginning of the year, OpenAI unveiled its $500 billion Stargate project, designed to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States to power its AI advances. Consequently, Microsoft lost its exclusive cloud provider status for OpenAI, though it still holds the right of first refusal.\n\nNVIDIA and OpenAI are set to finalize the new partnership details in the coming weeks, potentially addressing the ChatGPT maker's cloud compute woes.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

We're so limited right now in the services we can offer. There is so much more demand than what we can do.\"\n\nThe executive further elaborated that the compute constraints would place OpenAI in a tough spot within the next two years, forcing it to make painful tradeoffs. He indicated that the company might be forced to choose between curing cancer through research or providing free education to everyone on earth with 5-10 gigawatts of compute power.\n\nFollow Windows Central on Google News to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!"

Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nHello! Jim Cramer is known to take some heat for his stock picks, but it was his bashing of GameStop's 2021 meme rally that led him to hire a bodyguard.\n\nIn today's big story, Jimmy Kimmel returns to the late-night airways.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nMarkets: With rate cuts rolling in, are you wondering how to invest? Wall Street has some ideas.\n\nTech: Nvidia and OpenAI now have 100 billion reasons to help each other succeed.\n\nBusiness: There still isn't a deal to keep TikTok in the US, but here's what one could look like.\n\nBut first, give a big round of applause (or don't) for my next guest.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nKimmel's comeback\n\nRandy Holmes/ABC via Getty Images\n\nIt turns out \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" isn't going anywhere just yet.\n\nLess than a week after being suspended \"indefinitely\" over comments regarding Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel is scheduled to return to late-night television tonight.\n\n(If you're completely out of the loop, we recapped all the Kimmel drama and why it matters in Friday's newsletter.)\n\nIn a statement that probably went through more lawyers and PR people than I can count, Disney said it pulled Kimmel off the air \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.\" Kimmel's comments were \"ill-timed\" and \"insensitive,\" the House of Mouse added\n\nHowever, after some \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,\" Disney is bringing the show back.\n\nReactions from both ends of the spectrum quickly followed. Other late-night hosts welcomed his return. Some high-profile celebs and politicians celebrated the move as a win for free speech (California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Zohran Mamdani). Others felt Disney caved (Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet).\n\nKimmel's return comes with a slight caveat: Some viewers might still be unable to watch the show. That's because Sinclair, which played a key role in Kimmel's initial suspension, said it would not air the show on the 39 ABC affiliate stations it owns or controls.\n\nSinclair, which is the largest ABC affiliate, said it will air news programming instead and that discussions with ABC about the show's return are \"ongoing.\" Sinclair had issued a list of demands it wanted met before bringing the show back.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chair Brendan Carr referred BI to comments he made earlier Monday, in which he reiterated his agency's goal of trying to \"empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities.\"\n\nCarr, who last week said, \"This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" also pushed back on the idea that the FCC threatened to revoke Disney and ABC's licenses if they didn't fire Kimmel.\n\nIn the meantime, Disney finds itself in a tricky situation.\n\nOn the one hand, reinstating Kimmel is bound to make plenty of people happy. More than 400 celebrities signed a letter in support of Kimmel. There were also calls to boycott Disney due to the suspension.\n\nBut those who felt Kimmel's suspension was justified aren't likely to be happy about his return. (Whether they were supporters of Disney in the first place remains to be seen.) And even those who welcome Kimmel's return might still resent Disney for initially suspending him.\n\nAnd then there's the question of late night. The TV model for late-night shows was already fragile long before last week. But now that Kimmel and his show have become a lightning rod, any decision about the show going forward will be viewed with a magnifying glass and likely lead to more controversy.\n\n3 things in markets\n\nBank of America's Merrill and Wells Fargo are offering spot bitcoin ETF's to some of their clients as the investment vehicle surges in demand, Bloomberg Reported Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nCrypto prices tanked after hordes of traders rushed to liquidate their positions. Over 407,000 investors dumped positions on the crypto derivatives market in the 24 hours leading up to Monday, according to Coinglass data. Bitcoin fell 3%, while ethereum and dogecoin dropped as much as 9%.\n\nA new chapter for the stock market. The Fed's recent rate cut was met with a mostly neutral market response, but Wall Street forecasters are eyeing new investment opportunities. Here's where Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and others think investors should put their money.\n\nTylenol maker's stock tanks. News of the White House planning to link the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to autism caused shares for the drugmaker, Kenvue, to fall as much as 8%.\n\n3 things in tech\n\nThe AI Avengers have assembled. Nvidia and OpenAI are teaming up in an AI infrastructure deal that has the chipmaker investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI. This includes OpenAI constructing \"at least 10 gigawatts\" of AI data centers running Nvidia systems. Nvidia's stock jumped as much as 5% on news of the agreement, helping to push the S&P 500 to a fresh record high. And in case you're wondering how much $100 billion really is, BI's Katie Notopoulos puts things into perspective.\n\nThe jobs most — and least — likely to be transformed by generative AI. Indeed created the GenAI Skill Transformation Index to measure how generative AI will affect jobs or certain skills. From its findings, one overall message was clear: No job is totally immune, but not all jobs are equally exposed.\n\nThe H-1B fee is coming at a terrible time for Big Tech. IT outsourcing giants and tech companies were already navigating tariff threats, generative AI, and more. Now the new rules could upend their staffing models, according to analysts at TD Cowen who assessed the potential damage of Trump's new H-1B visa fee. Meanwhile, unionized Google employees held a press conference urging their employer to speak out against the matter.\n\n3 things in business\n\nTikTok (US version). The deal — which could land by the end of the week, according to the White House — could see a consortium of US investors, including Larry Ellison and potentially the Murdochs, buy TikTok's US assets. Post-sale, Oracle, which already serves as TikTok's data and security provider in the US, would also control TikTok's algorithm in partnership with the US government.\n\nMeet your new matchmaker: AI.

      "content": "Big tech is capable of throwing around some eye-watering amounts of cash. As you may recall, Nvidia announced $46.7 billion total revenue during its Q2 2025 earnings call. That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power.\n\nAs such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres.\n\nThe two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket.\n\nOnce this most recent deal is finalised, sources close to the company claim the plan is for Nvidia to invest an initial sum of $10 billion, followed by a hardware rollout sometime towards the end of 2026. The first gigawatt of power will likely take to the stage of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin AI compute platform, which was first revealed back in March.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a statement that it was all about maintaining a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded field, saying, \"Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.\"\n\nBut Nvidia spending money on OpenAI so OpenAI can then buy Nvidia hardware has raised some concerns; if this flow of cash looks a little circular to you, you're not the only one concerned about the potential shape of things to come.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon commented, \"On the one hand this [deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built. On the other hand the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Still though, the proposed 10 gigawatt data centres will demand power equivalent to the needs of 8 million U.S. households; despite Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's suggestion that AI customers 'pace themselves' and other major big tech players looking to nuclear to meet AI's power demands, there may come a time when such a power imbalance can no longer be ignored."

      "content": "OBS Studio 32.0 has been released. The update sees this streaming and screen recording stable gain a nifty new plugin manager, change a few of its default settings and expand its support for NVIDIA RTX effects.\n\nThe new plugin manager is described as “basic” because it is: it shows a list of installed plugins with a checkbox to enable/disable, but ‘Browse’ and ‘Update’ options are greyed out (those options being there suggests it will be possible to find and install plugins in OBS directly).\n\nOBS Studio 3.20 increases the default bitrate from 2500 to 6000 Kbps.\n\nThe old value was decided upon a decade ago, and expectations in quality have shifted. OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.\n\nUsers with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.\n\nHybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.\n\nOn Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.\n\nOther notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:\n\nOpt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)\n\nExperimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs\n\nAudio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc\n\n--disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed\n\nPlugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded\n\nBeyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.\n\nThough a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.\n\nHow to Install OBS Studio 32.0\n\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).\n\nOn Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.\n\nThere’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).\n\nTo install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\n\nThen, install OBS Studio using apt :\n\nsudo apt install obs-studio\n\nFinally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team."
