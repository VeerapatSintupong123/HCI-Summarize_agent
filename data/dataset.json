      "headline": "Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI investment raises eyebrows and a key question: How much of the AI boom is just Nvidia’s cash being recycled?",
      "content": "Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently. The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back.\n\nIn addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.\n\nThe extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.\n\nIn past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.\n\nNvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStartups financing data centers have often had to borrow money at rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% that a large, established corporation such as Microsoft might have to pay. With Nvidia’s backing, OpenAI and Coreweave have been able to borrow at rates closer to what Microsoft or Google might pay.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also signed a $6.3 billion deal to purchase any cloud capacity that CoreWeave can’t sell to others. The chipmaker had previously agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years on cloud computing with CoreWeave. Coreweave, meanwhile, has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs so far—the majority of which it says are H100 Hopper models, which cost about $30,000 each—which means Coreweave has spent about $7.5 billion buying these chips from Nvidia. So in essence, all of the money Nvidia has invested in Coreweave has come back to it in the form of revenue.\n\n\n\nNvidia has struck similar cloud computing deals with other so-called “neo-cloud” companies. According to a story in The Information, Nvidia agreed this summer to spend $1.3 billion over four years renting some 10,000 of its own AI chips from Lambda, which like Coreweave runs data centers, as well as a separate $200 million deal to rent some 8,000 more over an unspecified time period.\n\nFor those who believe there’s an AI bubble, the Lambda deal is clear evidence of froth. Those Nvidia chips Lambda is renting time on back to Nvidia? It bought them with borrowed money collateralized by the value of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\n\nBesides its large investments in OpenAI and Coreweave, AI chipmaker also holds multi-million dollar stakes in several other publicly-traded companies that either purchase its GPUs or work on related chip technology. These include chip design firm Arm, high-performance computing company Applied Digital, cloud services company Nebius Group, and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals. (Nvidia also recently purchased a 4% stake in Intel for $5 billion. Like Arm, Intel makes chips that in some cases are alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, but which for the most part are complementary to them.)\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia also pledged to invest £2 billion ($2.7 billion) in U.K. AI startups, including at least £500 million in Nscale, a U.K.-based data center operator that will, presumably, be using some of that money to purchase Nvidia GPUs to provision the data centers it is building. Nvidia also said it would invest in a number of British startups, both directly and through local venture capital firms, and some of that money too, will likely come back to OpenAI in the form of computing purchases, either directly, or through cloud service providers, who in turn will need to buy Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia invested about $1 billion in AI startups globally either directly or through its corporate venture capital arm NVentures, according to data from Dealroom and The Financial Times. This amount was up significantly from what Nvidia invested in 2022, the year the generative AI boom kicked off with OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nHow much of this money winds up coming right back to Nvidia in the form of sales is again, difficult to determine. Wall Street research firm NewStreet Research has estimated that for every $10 billion Nvidia invests in OpenAI, it will see $35 billion worth of GPU purchases or GPU lease payments, an amount equal to about 27% of its annual revenues last fiscal year.\n\nEchoes of the dotcom era\n\nThat kind of return would certainly make this sort of customer financing worthwhile. But it does raise concerns among analysts about a bubble in AI valuations. These kinds of circular deals have been a hallmark of previous technology bubbles and have often come back to haunt investors.\n\nIn this case, the lease arrangements that Nvidia is entering into with OpenAI as part of its latest investment could prove problematic. By leasing GPUs to OpenAI, rather than requiring them to buy the chips outright, Nvidia is sparing OpenAI from having to take an accounting charge for the high depreciation rates on the chips, which will ultimately help OpenAI’s bottom line. But it means that instead Nvidia will have to bear this depreciation costs. What’s more, Nvidia will also take on the risk of being stuck with an inventory of GPUs no one wants if demand for AI workloads don’t match Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rosy predictions.\n\n\n\nTo some market watchers, Nvidia’s latest deals feel all-too-similar to the excesses of past technology booms. During the dot com bubble at the turn of the 21st Century, telecom equipment makers such as Nortel, Lucent, and Cisco lent money to startups and telecom companies to purchase their equipment. Just before the bubble burst in 2001, the amount of financing Cisco and Nortel had extended to their customers exceeded 10% of annual revenues, and the amount of financing the top five telecom equipment makers had provided to customers exceeded 123% of their combined earnings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the amount of fiber-optic cabling and switching equipment installed far exceeded demand, and when the bubble burst and many of those customers went bust, the telecom equipment makers were left holding the bad debt on their balance sheets. This contributed to a greater loss of value when the bubble burst than would have otherwise been the case, with networking equipment businesses losing more than 90% of their value over the ensuing decade.\n\n\n\nWorse yet were companies such as fiber-optic giant Global Crossing that engaged in direct “revenue roundtripping.” These companies cut deals—often at the end of a quarter in order to hit topline forecasts—in which they paid money to another company for services, and then that company agreed to purchase equipment of exactly equal value. When the bubble burst, Global Crossing went bankrupt, and its executives ultimately paid large legal settlements related to revenue roundtripping.\n\n\n\nIt is memories of these kinds of transactions that have caused analysts to at least raise an eyebrow at some of Nvidia’s circular investments. Goldberg, the Seaport Global analyst, said the deals had a whiff of circular financing and were emblematic of “bubble-like behavior.”\n\n“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note following Nvidia’s announcement of its blockbuster investment in OpenAI. It’s a long way from a concern to a crisis, of course, but as AI company valuations get higher, that distance is starting to close.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "headline": "Actual ports and NVIDIA GPUs make this laptop the practical Dell XPS and MacBook Pro alternative",
      "content": "The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i is the premium, feature-packed 16-inch powerhouse for those who need to work, create, and even game on the go. It's an excellent, incredibly practical laptop that feels like the more reasonable alternative to the divisive Dell 16 Premium (previously the Dell XPS 16). I only wish battery life was better, but I can't say I'm shocked it's not.\n\nWhy you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nCreators, engineers, and other professionals the world over rely on powerful 16-inch laptops to keep them working smoothly, even while staying mobile. The Dell XPS 16 (now the Dell 16 Premium), the Apple MacBook Pro 16, the Razer Blade 16 — these are all great choices, but there's another excellent alternative on the block.\n\nThis is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition... which is a ridiculously long name for an incredibly capable laptop with a practical design, potent performance, and an impressive set of features that make it well-suited to almost any task.\n\nIt's also well priced compared to the aforementioned competition, making it one of the easiest to recommend. While other laptops often focus on sleek and minimalist designs (often at the expense of features or practicality), the Yoga Pro 9i doesn't cut any corners — or ports.\n\nDisclaimer This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. Lenovo had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.\n\nMy Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) review\n\nImage 1 of 4 The clean Lenovo logo and \"communications bar\" are in full display with this laptop. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Most people would be content with just the ports on one side. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) I'd prefer swapping one of those Type-A ports for a Thunderbolt 4 port on the other side, but this is a great I/O selection either way. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) These aren't the slimmest bezels on the block, but the Yoga Pro 9i still feels plenty premium. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDesign ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWhere the Dell 16 Premium (2025) we recently reviewed boasts a controversial, futuristic, and minimalist design, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i absolutely prioritizes function over form.\n\nIt's a familiar two-tier Lenovo design with a rounded base and squared-off lid, creating a unique profile entirely constructed of high-quality aluminum. The Yoga Pro 9i isn't the most refined high-end laptop I've held in my hand and doesn't feature the slimmest display bezel, but it absolutely looks and feels like a premium product.\n\nYou can immediately tell the Yoga Pro 9i is a truly premium laptop, even if it's not the most futuristic design.\n\nAt around 17.9mm thick and 1.93kg heavy, there are certainly beefier 16-inch workstations, but the Yoga Pro 9i's design does make it seem chunkier than it actually is.\n\nAt least you get a ton of ports. There's the 170W DC power port, an HDMI 2.1 port, two full-featured Thunderbolt 4 ports with Power Delivery and DisplayPort functions, a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB Type-A (5GBps) ports, a side-mounted power button, a webcam privacy shutter, and even a full-sized SD card slot. The only things missing are an Ethernet port (Lenovo would've had to make this laptop a fair bit thicker for that) and a Kensington Nano Security Slot, which may actually disappoint some professional users.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDisplay ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nLenovo actually offers two OLED, touchscreen PureSight Pro display options for the Yoga Pro 9i. Both panels boast a 120Hz refresh rate, excellent color accuracy across standard and cinematic gamuts, Dolby Vision HDR and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 1000 support, and the trifecta of TÜV Rheindland Low Blue Light, TÜV Rheinland Flicker-Free, and Eyesafe certifications.\n\nFor an extra $150, though, you can upgrade to a Tandem OLED display with a higher 3.2K resolution (up from 2.8K), even greater color accuracy (especially in the AdobeRGB gamut), twice the display brightness at up to 1,000 nits (compared to 500 nits, and that's not even with HDR enabled), and greater efficiency to boot. Sadly, Lenovo didn't send me that configuration to test, so I can't tell you just how much better that panel is.\n\nThe entry-level screen is still fantastic, though. It's bright, vibrant, and responsive whether I was working, editing photos, gaming, or watching videos. If the Tandem OLED display is even better, it'll be one of the best panels you'll find on a laptop right now.\n\nPerformance ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, a 16-core CPU with fantastic overall performance and solid efficiency. That's backed by up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 (8GB) GPU, but Lenovo sent me the entry-level configuration with an RTX 5050 inside — and it seriously impressed me.\n\nThis laptop is a strong performer in general, backed by Intel Evo guarantees for responsiveness and bolstered by excellent thermal management. The Yoga Pro 9i never got too warm, never suffered from abnormal throttling, and kept quiet enough even under load.\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i was practically guaranteed to deliver great performance, but it still managed to surprise me.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, it's the RTX 5050 that surprised me. Lenovo actually offers a GPU overclocking option, and when enabled the Yoga Pro 9i's RTX 5050 performed well beyond the level I expected, coming within a stone's throw of the far more expensive Dell 16 Premium's RTX 5070 without becoming thermally restrained.\n\nI was able to play Forza Horizon 5 with Extreme settings without any issues, either, never dipping below a stable 60 FPS.\n\nImage 1 of 3 I really like this keyboard, but I'm still not a fan of Lenovo's next key coating. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) There's a lot of power packed into this chassis, but you don't feel it most of the time. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Intel Evo, NVIDIA Studio — this laptop has all the ingredients it needs to tackle any workflow or task. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nBattery life ⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWith an 84Whr battery stashed away inside, the Yoga Pro 9i certainly has plenty of juice... but it's not enough to translate to true all-day battery life. In my testing, the Yoga Pro 9i can deliver around 5 hours of real-time usage — slightly better than the Dell 16 Premium and its larger 99Whr battery, but nothing too impressive.\n\nYou can use up to 100W USB Type-C chargers whenever you're in a pinch, at least. Performance when off the charger is throttled, but is still absolutely what I'd consider \"flagship\" level — especially the graphical oomph.\n\nThis laptop can't claim to boast the greatest endurance, but it's no worse than much of the competition.\n\nKeyboard & touchpad ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI've historically been a huge fan of Lenovo's keyboards, and that still mostly holds true with the Yoga Pro 9i. The layout, key travel, and consistency are all top-notch, and the keyboard doesn't feel too cramped despite having a compact tenkey number pad off to one side (a feature some will love, and others will hate).\n\nAs I noted in my Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i (Gen 9) Aura Edition review, though, the new coating Lenovo puts on its keys isn't my favorite. This is a good keyboard, it's just slippery.\n\nThe touchpad is spacious and responsive with Microsoft Precision drivers, so I have little to complain about there... but I do wish Lenovo would finally embrace haptic touchpads on its premium consumer laptops.\n\nLenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding doesn't mean anything to 99% of people... this laptop still delivers a great software experience, though. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nSoftware & AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i runs Windows 11, and it does so without issue. Drivers are stable and Lenovo hasn't injected an absurd amount of bloatware onto the device.\n\nLenovo didn't pour every feature imaginable into the Yoga Pro 9i, it just focused on delivering a capable, high-quality laptop.\n\nYou also get some extra features courtesy of Lenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding, such as multi-device syncing for photos and files, \"smart\" performance and settings profiles, and Lenovo's \"AI Now\" companion, but the Yoga Pro 9i is not a Copilot+ PC thanks to the weaker NPU of its processor, so it doesn't boast all the latest and greatest artificial intelligence features in Windows.\n\nThat won't make a difference to most people, but it's worth noting this laptop technically isn't on the cutting edge for software.\n\nEverything else ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe display isn't the only reason the Yoga Pro 9i is a monster for entertainment, as it also packs a capable six-speaker system (dual 2W tweeters and quad 2W woofers) with Dolby Atmos support.\n\nI won't go as far as claiming these are the best-sounding speakers in a laptop I've heard, but the Yoga Pro 9i does sound full, loud, and clear. You also get a quad microphone array flanking the great 5MP front-facing camera, which is supported by an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition.\n\nI never had any issues with the Wi-Fi 7 or Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, either. The Yoga Pro 9i doesn't rock any additional features like Human Presence Detection (HPD) or ambient light sensors, or a fingerprint reader, but the basics are covered and they're covered well.\n\nYoga Pro 9i (Gen 10) review: My final thoughts\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i isn't one of the most exciting laptops of 2025, but it is one of my favorites. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\n✅You should buy this if ...\n\nYou need a powerful, feature-packed 16-inch laptop for work and creation.\n\nYou also want that laptop to be good for PC gaming, too.\n\nYou want a laptop with a top-notch OLED display and speaker system.\n\n❌You should not buy this if ...\n\nYou actually care about Windows 11's Copilot+ PC-exclusive features.\n\nYou need a laptop with consistent, easy all-day battery life.\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition may have a slightly ridiculous name, but it's hands-down one of the greatest laptops in the category of \"powerful and premium 16-inch workstations.\"\n\nWhile Apple commits to minimalism and Dell pushes even more aggressively in that direction, Lenovo is delivering an equally capable laptop packed with features and ports — all while undercutting the competition on price. It's a shockingly practical laptop for productivity, creation, entertainment, and gaming.\n\nWhile I do wish the battery could withstand a full day's worth of work without compromise, that doesn't stop this from being one of the best Windows laptops I've tested this year. You can customize your own Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition from $1,869.99 at Lenovo.com, or pull the trigger on the configuration I most recommend for $2,149.99 at Lenovo.com, which upgrades you to that sweet Tandem OLED display and a more powerful RTX 5060 GPU.",

      "headline": "Jensen Huang says China is ‘nanoseconds behind’ the US in chipmaking, calls for reducing US export restrictions on Nvidia's AI chips",
      "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says China is just “nanoseconds behind” the U.S. in chipmaking and that Washington should stop trying to wall off the market. Speaking on the BG2 podcast , Huang argued that allowing companies like Nvidia to sell into China would serve American interests by spreading U.S. technology and extending its geopolitical influence. “We’re up against a formidable, innovative, hungry, fast-moving, underregulated [competitor],” Huang said, talking about the pedigree of China’s engineers and controversial 9-9-6 working culture.\n\nHis comments come as Nvidia hopes to ship its H20 AI GPU to Chinese customers again, following a months-long pause tied to new U.S. export rules. The Commerce Department is understood to have begun issuing licenses for the H20 in August , and Nvidia is already working on a successor chip designed to comply with current restrictions while offering better performance. The company has not confirmed specs, but it would be Nvidia’s second attempt to tailor an AI accelerator specifically for the Chinese marke t since the original A100 and H100 bans took effect.\n\nNVIDIA: OpenAI, Future of Compute, and the American Dream | BG2 w/ Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner - YouTube Watch On\n\nChina, meanwhile, is accelerating its own plans to become self-sufficient. Huawei’s new Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD systems, powered by the company’s Ascend 910B chips , are now shipping in volume. The company has laid out an ambitious roadmap through 2027 with next-gen Ascend silicon that aims to match or exceed current-gen performance. These systems are CUDA-free by design and optimized for Chinese-built software stacks, a shift that puts real pressure on Nvidia’s dominance, which, according to Huang, previously held a 95% market share in China.\n\nChinese hyperscalers are backing that roadmap with capital. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance are all investing in custom silicon, either through internal chip teams or by funding startups. That includes firms like Tencent, which has announced it has fully adapted its infrastructure to support homegrown silicon. Asked what he sees in the near future, Huang said, “They [China] publicly say… they want China to be an open market, they want… companies to come to China and compete in the marketplace… and I believe and I hope that we return to that.”\n\nNvidia’s approach to that is to maintain a foothold in China and play both sides of the geopolitical divide. The H20 may be hobbled compared to the company’s leading chips, but it gives Chinese companies a path to stay within the Nvidia ecosystem — at least for now.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

There are so many to choose from, I almost don't know where to begin.\n\nFirst, this is an Nvidia (NVDA) market. It's a market that will work for the bulls for as long as Nvidia works. If Nvidia is going to chart a course for AI domination, as seen in its new $100 billion OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) deal on Monday, and the stock gets pushed higher, it's bullish for the broader market.\n\n\"I think AI is a real thing,\" Robinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild said on Opening Bid (video above). \"I still think there's a lot of growth in this country. And you're starting to see it in other sectors, ... in aerospace and defense, for example. So I definitely think it's something you have to pay attention to.

I am not surprised he has gained a stock-moving following. He puts in the hard work to find undervalued names.\n\nJackson shared more about his views on Opendoor during his last appearance on Opening Bid — it's worth a watch.\n\nLastly, if you're a bear, it will be hard to stay that way as long as the Fed is cutting rates. I think Monday's commentary from new Fed member Stephen Miran on the need for a series of rate cuts is where policy may be headed.

      "headline": "Why Nvidia's Blueprint might be the best tool you'll use for 3D modelling",
      "content": "You may have heard of Nvidia Blueprints, but what are they exactly, and why is the latest addition, the new 3D Object Generation Blueprint, so special?\n\nIf you’ve been following NVIDIA’s AI announcements, you’ll know the company has been talking a lot about Blueprints. These are pre-built AI workflows that bundle together several advanced models into one easy-to-use package. For 3D artists, whether you’re a Blender hobbyist or a professional creating assets for games or film, the new 3D Object Generation Blueprint could be an innovative way to improve your workflow.\n\nTo understand more and why Blueprints matter, I spoke with Michael Fukuyama, Product Manager at Nvidia, who has been leading projects focused on creative, productivity, and generative AI use cases.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nRemoving the obstacles to 3D\n\nAccording to Fukuyama, the appeal of the Blueprint is that it can support a wide range of creators, not just studios with big budgets.\n\n“The 3D Object Generation Blueprint is designed for a wide spectrum of creators, from freelance 3D artists and indie game developers to architects and product designers,” he told me.\n\nThe biggest benefit is speed. Instead of laboriously sourcing stock assets or blocking out rough placeholders, it's possible to generate objects instantly and start refining them.\n\n“An artist working on a ‘city street’ environment could instantly generate 20 candidate objects – benches, lampposts, storefronts, cars – and then decide which to refine. Instead of spending hours searching for stock assets or roughing in placeholders, the artist starts with usable prototypes and can devote more time to creative polish,” Fukuyama explains.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFor hobbyists still learning their way around the best 3D modelling software, this can be especially helpful, as it removes the technical bottleneck and lets you focus on the creative side.\n\nThe tech, explained\n\nSo what makes this possible? Nvidia has combined several different AI tools into one streamlined pipeline.\n\n“The Blueprint stitches together several Nvidia NIM microservices and models into a single pipeline,” Fukuyama says, before explaining (deep breath, here comes the tech): “A large language model powered by the Llama 3.1 8B NIM brainstorms object ideas and prompt inputs for Nvidia SANA Sprint, which generates high-resolution preview images of those objects. From there, the Microsoft TRELLIS NIM microservice converts the chosen previews into 3D assets, now accelerated by 20% thanks to PyTorch optimisations within the NIM. By packaging these components, the Blueprint removes the need for users to wire models together themselves and ensures performance is optimised on RTX GPUs.”\n\nLet me break it down. For creators, that means you don’t need to be an AI engineer to get results. Everything runs locally on an RTX GPU, so if you’ve already been shopping around for the best Nvidia graphics cards for your PC, you’re halfway there.\n\nUsable 3D models\n\nA major selling point of the Blueprint is that the models it produces aren’t just placeholders. They’re functional 3D assets you can drop straight into your workflow.\n\n“‘Fully usable’ refers to the fact that generated assets are starting points towards production, not just rough meshes or flat previews,” Fukuyama tells me. “The Microsoft TRELLIS model creates objects with geometry, textures, and materials that can be imported directly into Blender and other 3D applications. While artists may still want to adjust topology or refine textures for final projects, the output is beyond a placeholder; it’s an asset that can immediately populate a scene, test lighting setups, or serve as a foundation for further detailing.”\n\nFor hobbyists, that could mean skipping the grey boxes and getting textured models right away. For pros, it provides a faster base to build on.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nSupport for all 3D software\n\nBlender is the natural starting point for integration, but Nvidia hasn’t limited the Blueprint to one tool.\n\n“Blender is the starting point because it’s free, open source, and used by a huge range of creators,” Fukuyama says. “But the Blueprint exports assets in standard formats, so artists can move them into tools like Maya, Cinema 4D, or 3ds Max without extra steps.”\n\nThat makes it a useful companion to whichever 3D modelling software you prefer to work with. With so many new generative AI tools emerging, it’s worth asking: why choose this one? For Fukuyama, the key lies in performance and ease of use.\n\n“The differentiator is twofold: performance and packaging,” he says. “Many generative 3D tools exist, but they often require heavy setup, technical know-how, or cloud access. Nvidia AI Blueprints bring together proven models, pre-tuned pipelines, and NIM microservices that are optimised to run locally on RTX GPUs. That means creators get faster iteration – 20% faster with TRELLIS on RTX 50 Series – and keep full control of their data and workflows. By combining generative AI with RTX acceleration, we’re making professional-grade 3D workflows accessible to more creators, directly on their AI PCs and workstations.”\n\nThat local-first approach is especially appealing if you’re running your setup on one of the best laptops for 3D modelling, where GPU power and portability go hand in hand.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nTime to try?\n\nFor anyone building 3D environments, the 3D Object Generation Blueprint is designed to take the grunt work out of the process. Whether you’re learning Blender at home or producing assets for a professional game, the promise is the same: more time for creativity, less time hunting for assets. (Read our Blender tutorials for more on how to get started.)\n\nAnd with Nvidia pushing to make its AI Blueprints run seamlessly on RTX GPUs, it’s clear the company is betting that these workflows will become essential tools for the next generation of digital artists, whether you’re experimenting with the best 3D software, starting in animation, or trying the best game development software to bring your ideas to life.\n\nVisit the Nvidia Blueprints website to learn more.",

      "headline": "Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti Super and RTX 5070 Super TDP leaked — long-rumored RTX 50 Super series GPUs appear in power supply calculator",
      "content": "Nvidia's mid-gen refresh for Blackwell is currently best rumored to launch next year at CES 2026. The RTX 50 Super series was recently caught up in the rumor mill, as some current-gen FE cards were delisted from the chipmaker's website, which was later confirmed to be a stock issue. Now, the informal chatter is set to reignite as Seasonic — a leading PSU manufacturer — has just listed a few RTX 50 Super models on its website, as part of its PSU calculator.\n\nVarious PC hardware companies have power supply calculators on their websites these days to not only help customers estimate the wattage they'll be pulling, but also to pick out an appropriate model subsequently. Hence, in these PSU calculators, one of the most crucial questions is that of the GPU: which graphics card would be in your system? For Seasonic, that list of potential nominees includes the unreleased and unannounced RTX 50 Super cards, at least two of which.\n\nSeasonic doesn't list the specs of a GPU beyond its TDP. Still, the RTX 50 Super series is rumored to feature 3 GB memory modules, effectively increasing the VRAM capacity by 50% while keeping the same number of chips onboard. That means the RTX 5070 Super would potentially have 18 GB (up from 12 GB on the 5070) of memory, and the 5070 Ti Super might rock 24 GB (up from 18 GB on the 5070 Ti), which would make them notable upgrades in what is otherwise a similar spec sheet.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nSeasonic states that the 5070 Super has a 275W TDP, which aligns with the leaked specs, as the additional 25W for the 6GB VRAM makes sense. The same goes for the 5070 Ti Super, which has a 350W TDP listed on the PSU calculator, a 50W increase over the standard 5070 Ti. The RTX 5080 Super is conspicuously missing from the website, but a 415W TDP has been leaked for it before. These numbers align with previous industry rumors, so Seasonic's not necessarily leaking anything new, but rather corroborating existing information.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 50 Super Series*\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Graphics Card GPU Die GPU Cores (CUDA) Memory (Capacity, bus) TDP Price RTX 5090 GB202-300 21,760 32 GB, 512-bit 575 W $2,000 RTX 5080 Super GB203-450 10,752 24 GB, 256-bit ~415 W TBD RTX 5080 GB203-400 10,752 16 GB, 256-bit 360 W $1,000 RTX 5070 Ti Super GB203-350 8,960 24 GB, 256-bit 350 W TBD RTX 5070 Ti GB203-200 8,960 16 GB, 256-bit 300 W $750 RTX 5070 Super GB205-400 6,400 18 GB, 192-bit 275 W TBD RTX 5070 GB205-300-A1 6,144 12 GB, 192-bit 250 W $550 RTX 5060 Ti GB205-300 4,608 8 / 16 GB, 128-bit 180 W $380 / $430 RTX 5060 GB206-250 3,840 8 GB, 128-bit 145 W $300\n\n*Specifications are unconfirmed.\n\nOf course, just because the RTX 50 Super series appears on a random PSU calculator doesn't mean it actually exists, but all signs do point toward it eventually being released. Unannounced GPUs appearing on PSU calculators is actually nothing new, so there's some credence to this model. Nvidia could be waiting till the first anniversary of the Blackwell launch to unveil its mid-gen refresh, which would be at CES next year. More substantial leaks from AIBs should start to emerge around that period, if such a launch is indeed planned.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering.\n\nOn Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000.

Business Insider wants to hear from you.

      "headline": "The big challenge to OpenAI's $100B deal with Nvidia: Access to power",
      "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThey've got the money and the chips. Now they need the power.\n\nNvidia announced Monday that it plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would give the ChatGPT maker a major leg up in the AI race — access to 10 gigawatts worth of the high-powered GPUs it needs to satisfy its mushrooming growth strategy.\n\nWhat the deal can't guarantee — and what neither company mentioned — is how OpenAI will access the enormous amount of electricity needed to fire up those chips.\n\n\"It is a huge hurdle to get access to power,\" said Benjamin Hertz-Shargel, head grid expert at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Monday's deal announcement, he added, is \"a far cry\" from a finished data center.\n\nThe deal, which the companies committed to in a letter of intent, highlights a growing constraint of the AI race: Access to electricity. The US power grid is already strained by an explosion of data center construction. Adding another 10 gigawatts of demand would amount to adding a power load nearly equivalent to New York City at its summer peak.\n\n\"Nationally, utilities are reporting the need for about 60 gigawatts of new power — six large cities' worth — to serve new data centers by the end of the decade,\" said Rob Gramlich, an energy policy consultant and founder of Grid Strategies.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment for this story, but its deal with Nvidia underscores the physical and financial challenges required to develop and commercialize AI. Beyond cutting-edge software, leaders must have access to chips, data centers, and the electricity needed to power that infrastructure.\n\n\"Infrastructure is critical to everything we do,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a joint interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on CNBC on Monday. \"Without doing this, we can't deliver the services people want.\"\n\nThe 'silent bottleneck'\n\nLimited access to power amid rampant data center growth is \"the silent bottleneck\" slowing the pace of Big Tech's ambitions for AI, said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology.\n\nData centers access electricity the same way everyone else does — by connecting to the power grid through public utility companies and paying them for service. However, connecting to the power grid can come with a slew of regulatory and financial hurdles that are only increasing as utilities struggle to keep up with skyrocketing demand.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThe surge in new service requests from data centers is so unprecedented that it has overwhelmed the country's major utilities and sparked a mad dash to build new infrastructure — a complex process that requires years of planning and regulatory approval.\n\nAs more data centers line up to connect, new development is being curbed. Commercial real estate services firm CBRE said that roughly 5.2 gigawatts of new data centers were underway in prime US markets in the first half of 2025, a 17.5% decline in the industry's construction pipeline from the same period a year prior, and that the limiting factor was power to light them up.\n\nAn additional 10 gigawatts of new demand adds even more pressure to an already strained system — and it represents only a slice of the electricity OpenAI will ultimately need to power its AI plans.\n\nIn July, OpenAI and Oracle announced they'd finalized plans to develop 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity, including a site in Abilene, Texas, that was announced in January as part of Stargate, a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on whether an official contract had been signed, but a spokesperson for the company said that the 10 gigawatts of demand announced Monday is new and is not accounted for in any of OpenAI's previously announced plans.\n\nWhile the media focuses on stock market fluctuations and the inner workings of tech companies, \"the industry is worried about power,\" said Gastwirth.\n\nBig Tech needs to 'get creative'\n\nIt's against this backdrop that access to electricity is gaining in value. One of the year's largest merger and acquisition deals in the data center sector has been imperiled because shareholders believe the takeover target is worth more, in part because of its access to power.\n\nThe US power grid, as it stands today, was built in the 1950s and 1960s. It was due for major upgrades before the data center development boom, but the AI race has made new power plants and power lines — and a lot of them — a more urgent necessity. The US Department of Energy has warned that the number of blackouts in the US could increase by 100 in 2030 if new power infrastructure is not built.\n\nSome data center operators have taken matters into their own hands, bypassing public utilities and going \"off grid\" to build their own on-site power plants. The first Stargate site in Abilene has done this with on-site natural gas turbines. Elon Musk has been powering his xAI data center in Memphis with natural gas generators for months, drawing ire from environmental and community activists who say they are a risk to air quality and public health.\n\nThe tech industry will have to \"get creative\" to solve the power problem, Gastwirth said. \"This is going to become a bigger and bigger issue as each year progresses.\"\n\nBig Tech companies have significantly ramped up investment in the energy sector, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into emerging technologies like hydrogen fuel cells and nuclear fusion. Amazon and Microsoft have signed deals to buy electricity from major industrial nuclear plants. Altman himself is a major investor in Oklo, a small modular reactor company that has, despite its pending regulatory approval, has already signed deals to power data centers.\n\nDespite the current challenges in accessing power, experts largely see OpenAI's deal with Nvidia as a smart strategic move, cementing the status of both companies as AI's leading players.\n\nSean Farney, executive director of data center strategy and innovation and Jones Lang Lasalle, said that Nvidia is the \"lead horse\" in the development of cutting-edge AI processors and that OpenAI's deal to secure that equipment was \"brilliant.\"\n\n\"It's the two leaders getting together to ensure that they will continue to be the leaders,\" Farney said.\n\nThe power problem, said Farney, will work itself out.\n\n\"They will find or self-source the power to make this happen. There's too much interest and dollar signs on this deal,\" he said.",

Jim Cramer is known to take some heat for his stock picks, but it was his bashing of GameStop's 2021 meme rally that led him to hire a bodyguard.\n\nIn today's big story, Jimmy Kimmel returns to the late-night airways.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nMarkets: With rate cuts rolling in, are you wondering how to invest? Wall Street has some ideas.\n\nTech: Nvidia and OpenAI now have 100 billion reasons to help each other succeed.\n\nBusiness: There still isn't a deal to keep TikTok in the US, but here's what one could look like.\n\nBut first, give a big round of applause (or don't) for my next guest.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nKimmel's comeback\n\nRandy Holmes/ABC via Getty Images\n\nIt turns out \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" isn't going anywhere just yet.\n\nLess than a week after being suspended \"indefinitely\" over comments regarding Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel is scheduled to return to late-night television tonight.\n\n(If you're completely out of the loop, we recapped all the Kimmel drama and why it matters in Friday's newsletter.)\n\nIn a statement that probably went through more lawyers and PR people than I can count, Disney said it pulled Kimmel off the air \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.\" Kimmel's comments were \"ill-timed\" and \"insensitive,\" the House of Mouse added\n\nHowever, after some \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,\" Disney is bringing the show back.\n\nReactions from both ends of the spectrum quickly followed. Other late-night hosts welcomed his return. Some high-profile celebs and politicians celebrated the move as a win for free speech (California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Zohran Mamdani). Others felt Disney caved (Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet).\n\nKimmel's return comes with a slight caveat: Some viewers might still be unable to watch the show. That's because Sinclair, which played a key role in Kimmel's initial suspension, said it would not air the show on the 39 ABC affiliate stations it owns or controls.\n\nSinclair, which is the largest ABC affiliate, said it will air news programming instead and that discussions with ABC about the show's return are \"ongoing.\" Sinclair had issued a list of demands it wanted met before bringing the show back.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chair Brendan Carr referred BI to comments he made earlier Monday, in which he reiterated his agency's goal of trying to \"empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities.\"\n\nCarr, who last week said, \"This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" also pushed back on the idea that the FCC threatened to revoke Disney and ABC's licenses if they didn't fire Kimmel.\n\nIn the meantime, Disney finds itself in a tricky situation.\n\nOn the one hand, reinstating Kimmel is bound to make plenty of people happy. More than 400 celebrities signed a letter in support of Kimmel. There were also calls to boycott Disney due to the suspension.\n\nBut those who felt Kimmel's suspension was justified aren't likely to be happy about his return. (Whether they were supporters of Disney in the first place remains to be seen.) And even those who welcome Kimmel's return might still resent Disney for initially suspending him.\n\nAnd then there's the question of late night. The TV model for late-night shows was already fragile long before last week. But now that Kimmel and his show have become a lightning rod, any decision about the show going forward will be viewed with a magnifying glass and likely lead to more controversy.\n\n3 things in markets\n\nBank of America's Merrill and Wells Fargo are offering spot bitcoin ETF's to some of their clients as the investment vehicle surges in demand, Bloomberg Reported Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nCrypto prices tanked after hordes of traders rushed to liquidate their positions.

      "content": "Big tech is capable of throwing around some eye-watering amounts of cash. As you may recall, Nvidia announced $46.7 billion total revenue during its Q2 2025 earnings call. That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power.\n\nAs such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres.\n\nThe two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket.\n\nOnce this most recent deal is finalised, sources close to the company claim the plan is for Nvidia to invest an initial sum of $10 billion, followed by a hardware rollout sometime towards the end of 2026. The first gigawatt of power will likely take to the stage of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin AI compute platform, which was first revealed back in March.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a statement that it was all about maintaining a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded field, saying, \"Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.\"\n\nBut Nvidia spending money on OpenAI so OpenAI can then buy Nvidia hardware has raised some concerns; if this flow of cash looks a little circular to you, you're not the only one concerned about the potential shape of things to come.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon commented, \"On the one hand this [deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built. On the other hand the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Still though, the proposed 10 gigawatt data centres will demand power equivalent to the needs of 8 million U.S. households; despite Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's suggestion that AI customers 'pace themselves' and other major big tech players looking to nuclear to meet AI's power demands, there may come a time when such a power imbalance can no longer be ignored."

OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.\n\nUsers with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.\n\nHybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.\n\nOn Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.\n\nOther notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:\n\nOpt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)\n\nExperimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs\n\nAudio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc\n\n--disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed\n\nPlugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded\n\nBeyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.\n\nThough a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.\n\nHow to Install OBS Studio 32.0\n\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).\n\nOn Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.\n\nThere’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).\n\nTo install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\n\nThen, install OBS Studio using apt :\n\nsudo apt install obs-studio\n\nFinally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team."

But China wants to change that. The world's second largest economy is pouring huge amounts of money into artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Crucially, Beijing is also investing heavily to produce the high-end chips that power these cutting-edge technologies. Last month, Jensen Huang - the boss of Silicon Valley-based AI chip giant Nvidia - warned that China was just \"nanoseconds behind\" the US in chip development. So can Beijing match American technology and break its reliance on imported high-end chips?\n\nAfter DeepSeek\n\nChina's DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech world in 2024 when it launched a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The announcement by a relatively unknown startup was impressive for a number of reasons, not least because the company said it cost much less to train than leading AI models. It was said to have been created using far fewer high-end chips than its rivals, and its launch temporarily sank Silicon Valley-based Nvidia's market value. And momentum in China's tech sector has continued. This year, some of the country's big tech firms have made it clear that they aim to take on Nvidia and become the main advanced chip suppliers for local companies. In September, Chinese state media said a new chip announced by Alibaba can match the performance of Nvidia's H20 semiconductors while using less energy. H20s are scaled-down processors made for the Chinese market under US export rules. Huawei also unveiled what it said were its most powerful chips ever, along with a three-year plan to challenge Nvidia's dominance of the AI market. The Chinese tech giant also said it would make its designs and computer programs available to the public in China in an effort to draw firms away from their reliance on US products.\n\nGetty Images DeepSeek stunned the tech world in 2024 when it launched an AI model to rival ChatGPT\n\nOther Chinese chip developers have also secured major contracts with big businesses in the country. MetaX is supplying advanced chips for the likes of state-owned telecoms operator, China Unicom. Another hotly-tipped potential challenger to Nvidia is Beijing-based Cambricon Technologies. Its Shanghai-listed shares have more than doubled in value over the last three months as investors bet that it will benefit from Beijing's push for Chinese firms to use locally produced high-end chips. Tencent, which owns the super app WeChat, is another notable tech giant that has heeded the government’s call to use Chinese chips. There has also been no shortage of state-backed trade shows, promoting Chinese technology companies in a bid to attract investors. \"The competition has undeniably arrived,\" a spokesperson for Nvidia told the BBC in response to queries about the recent progress made by Chinese chip firms. \"Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world's most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We'll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere.\" Yet some experts have cautioned that claims made by Chinese chipmakers should be taken with a pinch of salt due to a lack of publicly available data and consistent testing benchmarks. China's semiconductors perform similarly to the US in predictive AI but fall short in complex analytics, said computer scientist Jawad Haj-Yahya, who has tested both American and Chinese chips. \"The gap is clear and it is surely shrinking. But I don't think it's something they will catch up on in the short-term.\"\n\nWhere China leads - and lags\n\nOn the BG2 technology and business podcast in September, Nvidia's Jensen Huang highlighted the strengths of China's tech sector, crediting its hardworking and vast talent pool, intense domestic competition and progress in chipmaking. \"This is a vibrant entrepreneurial, high-tech, modern industry,\" he said, urging the US to compete \"for its survival\". His assessment is likely to be welcomed by officials in Beijing. The country has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West. For years, China has invested heavily in what President Xi Jinping calls \"high-quality development\", which covers industries from renewables to AI. Even before US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, China had spent tens of billions of dollars as part of its efforts to transform its vast economy from the \"world's factory\" for basic products to a home of cutting-edge industries. An ongoing tariffs war with Trump's America has only made that mission more urgent. Xi has vowed to make his country more self-reliant and not depend on \"anyone's gifts\".\n\nMr Huang has also warned that the US should trade freely with China or risk handing it the edge in the AI race. This comes against a backdrop of Beijing applying more pressure on Nvidia as it launched an anti-monopoly probe into the firm last month. But China's state-led approach can also be an obstacle to innovation if everyone in the sector only focuses on a \"shared goal\", said computing professor Chia-Lin Yang from the National Taiwan University. It can make it harder for disruptive ideas to break the mould, she added. China's chip industry has also yet to overcome criticism that its products can be less user-friendly than those of Western rivals like Nvidia. Prof Yang believes these issues can soon be solved by China's huge number of skilled tech industry workers. \"You cannot underestimate China's ability to catch up.\"\n\nGetty Images Chinese tech giant Huawei unveiled its plans to rival Nvidia's dominance in AI chips\n\n'Bargaining chip' for China",

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhile Huawei talks about exaFLOP levels of performance today, Nvidia highlights a stable, battle-tested platform, and AMD pitches itself as the challenger offering superior scalability down the road.\n\nAt the heart of these clusters are heavy-duty processors built to deliver immense computational power and handle data-intensive AI and HPC workloads.\n\nHuawei’s Atlas 950 SuperPoD is designed around 8,192 Ascend 950 NPUs, with reported peaks of 8 exaFLOPS in FP8 and 16 exaFLOPS in FP16 - so it is clearly aimed at handling both training and inference at an enormous scale.\n\nNvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, built on DGX A100 nodes, delivers a different flavor of performance - with 20 nodes containing a total of 160 A100 GPUs, it looks smaller in terms of chip count.\n\nHowever, each GPU is optimized for mixed precision AI tasks and paired with high-speed InfiniBand to keep latency low.\n\nAMD’s MegaPod is still on the horizon, but early details suggest it will pack 256 Instinct MI500 GPUs alongside 64 Zen 7 “Verano” CPUs.\n\nWhile its raw compute numbers are not yet published, AMD’s goal is to rival or exceed Nvidia’s efficiency and scale, especially as it uses next-generation PCIe Gen 6 and 3-nanometer networking ASICs.\n\nFeeding thousands of accelerators requires staggering amounts of memory and interconnect speed.\n\nHuawei claims the Atlas 950 SuperPoD carries more than a petabyte of memory, with a total system bandwidth of 16.3 petabytes per second.\n\nThis kind of throughput is designed to keep data moving without bottlenecks across its racks of NPUs.\n\nNvidia’s DGX SuperPOD does not attempt to match such headline numbers, instead relying on 52.5 terabytes of system memory and 49 terabytes of high-bandwidth GPU memory, coupled with InfiniBand links of up to 200Gbps per node.\n\nThe focus here is on predictable performance for workloads that enterprises already run.\n\nAMD, meanwhile, is targeting the bleeding edge with its Vulcano switch ASICs offering 102.4Tbps capacity and 800Gbps per tray external throughput.\n\nCombined with UALink and Ultra Ethernet, this suggests a system that will surpass current networking limits once it launches in 2027.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the three contenders lies in how they are physically built.\n\nHuawei’s design allows for expansion from a single SuperPoD to half a million Ascend chips in a SuperCluster.\n\nThere are also claims that an Atlas 950 configuration could involve more than a hundred cabinets spread over a thousand square meters.\n\nNvidia’s DGX SuperPOD takes a more compact approach, with its 20 nodes integrated in a cluster style that enterprises can deploy without needing a stadium-sized data hall.\n\nAMD’s MegaPod splits the difference, with two racks of compute trays plus one dedicated networking rack, showing that its architecture is centered around a modular but powerful layout.\n\nIn terms of availability, Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD is already on the market, Huawei’s Atlas 950 SuperPoD is expected in late 2026, and AMD’s MegaPod is planned for 2027.\n\nThat said, these chips are fighting very different battles under the same banner of AI supercomputing supremacy.\n\nHuawei’s Atlas 950 SuperPoD is a show of brute force, stacking thousands of NPUs and jaw-dropping bandwidth to dominate at scale, but its size and proprietary design may make it harder for outsiders to adopt.\n\nNvidia’s DGX SuperPOD looks smaller on paper, yet it wins on polish and reliability, offering a proven platform that enterprises and research labs can plug in today without waiting for promises.\n\nAMD’s MegaPod, still in development, has the makings of a disruptor, with its MI500 accelerators and radical new networking fabric that could tilt the balance once it arrives, but until then, it is a challenger talking big.\n\nVia Huawei, Nvidia, TechPowerUp",

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks Wall Street is watching.\n\nChris Rolland from Susquehanna said during a program on CNBC last month that Nvidia’s growth will eventually slow down and hit a “wall.” However, the analyst remains bullish on the stock and praised the company’s recent quarter numbers.\n\n“I think eventually we will hit some sort of a wall when it comes to this deceleration. I don’t know if it’s next year, but eventually we’re going to have a flat year and everyone’s going to freak out and think that the P multiple might even be too high. It’s been a meteoric rise. I’m not getting off the train just yet. There’s still a lot of growth here. Whether you’re talking about hyperscale capex, we’ve seen incredible improvement, but there’s probably still another 20 or 30% to go there over the next few years. We have sovereign ahead of us. We have China ahead of us. There’s still some opportunity here.”\n\nThe current AI boom cycle stems from spending by major tech companies, and Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of this spending. In Q2 FY2026, three direct customers accounted for 23%, 19%, and 14% of NVDA’s accounts receivable. Almost all of the company's revenue comes from AI-related infrastructure spending. In the latest quarter, $41.3 billion of the $46.7 billion revenue came from these clients. The music could stop for Nvidia if these major companies decide to slow down their spending amid a lack of ROI. If investors sense a weakness in CapEx spending, and the market begins to waver, NVDA stock price would be the first to see its impact.\n\nBaird Chautauqua International and Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported first quarter results that were extremely solid. The company took a write-down on China-specific datacenter products and flushed out any future China contributions from their guidance, following the new export restrictions introduced in April. Demand commentary ex China was extremely encouraging—Nvidia is outgrowing expectations despite supply constraints and outgrowing competing ASIC products by a large margin. We have been underweight Nvidia relative to the benchmark, which was up 46% in the quarter, given our short-to medium-term concerns that the feverish AI datacenter build may be resulting in overcapacity, which has not come to bear.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "content": "How China is challenging Nvidia's AI chip dominance\n\n9 hours ago Share Save Osmond Chia Business reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Jensen Huang, the boss of Silicon Valley-based Nvidia, has warned China is \"nanoseconds behind\" the US in chips\n\nThe US has dominated the global technology market for decades. But China wants to change that. The world's second largest economy is pouring huge amounts of money into artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Crucially, Beijing is also investing heavily to produce the high-end chips that power these cutting-edge technologies. Last month, Jensen Huang - the boss of Silicon Valley-based AI chip giant Nvidia - warned that China was just \"nanoseconds behind\" the US in chip development. So can Beijing match American technology and break its reliance on imported high-end chips?\n\nAfter DeepSeek\n\nChina's DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the tech world in 2024 when it launched a rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The announcement by a relatively unknown startup was impressive for a number of reasons, not least because the company said it cost much less to train than leading AI models. It was said to have been created using far fewer high-end chips than its rivals, and its launch temporarily sank Silicon Valley-based Nvidia's market value. And momentum in China's tech sector has continued. This year, some of the country's big tech firms have made it clear that they aim to take on Nvidia and become the main advanced chip suppliers for local companies. In September, Chinese state media said a new chip announced by Alibaba can match the performance of Nvidia's H20 semiconductors while using less energy. H20s are scaled-down processors made for the Chinese market under US export rules. Huawei also unveiled what it said were its most powerful chips ever, along with a three-year plan to challenge Nvidia's dominance of the AI market. The Chinese tech giant also said it would make its designs and computer programs available to the public in China in an effort to draw firms away from their reliance on US products.\n\nGetty Images DeepSeek stunned the tech world in 2024 when it launched an AI model to rival ChatGPT\n\nOther Chinese chip developers have also secured major contracts with big businesses in the country. MetaX is supplying advanced chips for the likes of state-owned telecoms operator, China Unicom. Another hotly-tipped potential challenger to Nvidia is Beijing-based Cambricon Technologies. Its Shanghai-listed shares have more than doubled in value over the last three months as investors bet that it will benefit from Beijing's push for Chinese firms to use locally produced high-end chips. Tencent, which owns the super app WeChat, is another notable tech giant that has heeded the government’s call to use Chinese chips. There has also been no shortage of state-backed trade shows, promoting Chinese technology companies in a bid to attract investors. \"The competition has undeniably arrived,\" a spokesperson for Nvidia told the BBC in response to queries about the recent progress made by Chinese chip firms. \"Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world's most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We'll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere.\" Yet some experts have cautioned that claims made by Chinese chipmakers should be taken with a pinch of salt due to a lack of publicly available data and consistent testing benchmarks. China's semiconductors perform similarly to the US in predictive AI but fall short in complex analytics, said computer scientist Jawad Haj-Yahya, who has tested both American and Chinese chips. \"The gap is clear and it is surely shrinking. But I don't think it's something they will catch up on in the short-term.\"\n\nWhere China leads - and lags\n\nOn the BG2 technology and business podcast in September, Nvidia's Jensen Huang highlighted the strengths of China's tech sector, crediting its hardworking and vast talent pool, intense domestic competition and progress in chipmaking. \"This is a vibrant entrepreneurial, high-tech, modern industry,\" he said, urging the US to compete \"for its survival\". His assessment is likely to be welcomed by officials in Beijing. The country has long vied to become a global leader in tech, partly to reduce its reliance on the West. For years, China has invested heavily in what President Xi Jinping calls \"high-quality development\", which covers industries from renewables to AI. Even before US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, China had spent tens of billions of dollars as part of its efforts to transform its vast economy from the \"world's factory\" for basic products to a home of cutting-edge industries. An ongoing tariffs war with Trump's America has only made that mission more urgent. Xi has vowed to make his country more self-reliant and not depend on \"anyone's gifts\".\n\nMr Huang has also warned that the US should trade freely with China or risk handing it the edge in the AI race. This comes against a backdrop of Beijing applying more pressure on Nvidia as it launched an anti-monopoly probe into the firm last month. But China's state-led approach can also be an obstacle to innovation if everyone in the sector only focuses on a \"shared goal\", said computing professor Chia-Lin Yang from the National Taiwan University. It can make it harder for disruptive ideas to break the mould, she added. China's chip industry has also yet to overcome criticism that its products can be less user-friendly than those of Western rivals like Nvidia. Prof Yang believes these issues can soon be solved by China's huge number of skilled tech industry workers. \"You cannot underestimate China's ability to catch up.\"\n\nGetty Images Chinese tech giant Huawei unveiled its plans to rival Nvidia's dominance in AI chips\n\n'Bargaining chip' for China",

      "headline": "Nintendo Switch 2 supports two different types of Nvidia DLSS — A second, 'light' version for upscaling beyond 1080p, along with the standard, PC-like CNN model",
      "content": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is the only mainstream console that comes with Nvidia hardware inside, while Microsoft and Sony rely on AMD. Therefore, the Switch 2 supports Nvidia's proprietary DLSS technology that helps it upscale games to 1080p and beyond, which is crucial in a handheld with power constraints. It was long speculated that the version of DLSS present on the Switch 2 was unique and unlike the standard models available on PC, and Digital Foundry's latest testing has confirmed that.\n\nNintendo Switch 2 DLSS Image Quality Analysis: \"Tiny\" DLSS/Full-Fat DLSS Confirmed - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhile looking at a diverse selection of titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars Outlaws, The Touryst, and Fast Fusion; Digital Foundry observed that there are two different DLSS versions at work.\n\nFirst up, there's \"Fat DLSS\" that resembles the CNN-based model found on PC, and this can only upscale games to 1080p. It has a cleaner, sharper image in motion, less artifacting, better antialiasing, and smoother camera cuts. Objects move in and out of motion almost identically to how they would on PC — which is to say, gracefully.\n\nBut, as mentioned, it's limited to 1080p. To go past that resolution, Nvidia and Nintendo have developed a special \"DLSS Light\" which can upscale to greater resolutions (remember, Switch 2 is marketed for up to 4K when docked). This version looks better in stills, but looses sharpness as soon as you move because reconstruction techniques get temporarily disabled. It introduces artifacts where you can see unfiltered pixels, but at the benefit of half the frame-time cost, which allows it to scale way past just 1080p.\n\n(Image credit: Jeffrey Kampman/Tom's Hardware)\n\nThis goes to show just how demanding the original version of DLSS is; it doesn't make sense to run that on every game, especially in handheld mode. When you need to reach resolutions higher than 1080p, the light model should still be better, despite its inferior temporal performance. What remains to be seen, though, is whether the newer, more efficient Transformer-based model of DLSS can somehow make its way onto the Switch 2 in the future.\n\nDigital Foundry even reached out to an unnamed but respected developer familiar with DLSS on the Switch, who confirmed that two versions of the tech do indeed exist in the pipeline to choose from. The light version is newer, and more uniquely suited to the Switch 2's hardware capabilities. We haven't seen any first-party Nintendo game utilize DLSS so far either, so that's also something to keep an eye on, given how most Nintendo games focus on precise movement and controls.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "headline": "Gamers, don't wait for Windows 10's demise - it's time to upgrade to Windows 11 or even SteamOS",
      "content": "In case you somehow missed it, Microsoft is saying goodbye to Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, when support for security updates will come to an end. This means PC gamers who have been adamant about staying away from Windows 11 will be left with a few options.\n\nThe first is simply staying on Windows 10, and if doing so, I'd say it's compulsory to sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU) scheme to get another year of updates. (Do not try running an operating system without the latest security patches).\n\nAnother choice could be to finally upgrade to Windows 11 - assuming your PC meets the hardware requirements - or you could even switch to the bloatware-free Tiny11 spin on Microsoft's OS.\n\nOr you could leave the Microsoft ecosystem entirely and switch to Valve's SteamOS. If you've read any of my previous articles on this topic, you'll know that my favored recommendation is SteamOS, but there are pros and cons whichever choice you make.\n\nIn some respects, Valve's SteamOS (which is Linux-based) is a better bet for gamers than Microsoft's desktop OS - it clearly is for handhelds - boasting a streamlined game mode that essentially replicates a gaming console's user interface for couch play, and is designed to allow players to jump into games without much hassle. It's not all perfect in SteamOS, though, as there are compatibility wrinkles - notably several popular multiplayer games (like Call of Duty) use anti-cheat and won't run on the operating system. On top of that, using certain game mods can sometimes be a bit of a pain.\n\nWindows 11 is still a great operating system for gaming, and you won't run into any stumbling blocks in terms of incompatibility here. It's also generally easy to get to grips with and simple enough in terms of the nuts and bolts of files and folders (file systems can be more cumbersome in Linux, certainly for computing novices). Microsoft is also delivering a similar simple game mode experience to SteamOS, with the upcoming 'full-screen experience' launching on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally.\n\nWhere Windows 11 falls down is with some of the frustrating bugs that can occur with the monthly updates (which are forced onto your PC - at least with Windows 11 Home, where you can only briefly delay their installation). This was particularly evident with Windows 11 24H2 breaking games, alongside oft-voiced criticisms online around bloatware and background processes messing with gaming performance.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Capcom recently announced that it will be dropping support for Monster Hunter games on Windows 10 - and other game publishers will surely follow in its footsteps.\n\nCapcom move spells bad news for other games on Windows 10\n\n(Image credit: Capcom)\n\nI've touched on this already, but Capcom's announcement is not to be taken lightly. Windows 10 gamers are at risk of facing hiccups - or perhaps major spanners in the works - in Monster Hunter games in the future due to support being cast aside.\n\nThis will surely affect new releases from Capcom, too. While I'm sure the highly anticipated Resident Evil Requiem will work fine on Windows 10, I won't be surprised if players start to face issues either at launch or later down the line. When future game updates aren't checked with Windows 10, problems may inevitably creep in - and the developer won't address them.\n\nYou may have ongoing security updates for Windows 10 with the ESU scheme, but if your games aren't being supported, that could become a big problem - and you can bet it won't just be Capcom doing this.\n\n(Image credit: Rockstar Games)\n\nIt's likely a long way down the road, but there's now no guarantee that Rockstar's GTA 6 will run well on Windows 10 - or even support it. I know, that sounds like a stretch, and it would be a surprise if it didn't support Windows 10 considering how accessible GTA 5 was. However, we're looking at possibly 2027 or 2028 for GTA 6's eventual launch on PC - the grand picture for Windows could look quite different then.\n\nIn my opinion, publishers dropping support for Windows 10 could affect so many other upcoming (or unannounced) games, that it might be best to save yourself the headache with all this and pick your upgrade path now.\n\nIf I were forced to choose, I'd pick SteamOS, but I have to recommend Windows 11 for those who can install it\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nIn my eyes, SteamOS is the better operating system compared to Windows when it comes to ease of use for gaming, but Valve's OS isn't quite there just yet for most desktop PC users.\n\nFor handheld gaming PCs, SteamOS is an absolute no-brainer, and I'd recommend choosing it over Windows 11 every time, since it's no secret that Microsoft's OS isn't very handheld-friendly. Microsoft is introducing the full-screen experience game mode, though, which tames background processes and bloatware, and ultimately frees up more resources for games to use in Windows 11 – but I'm still not convinced it'll dethrone SteamOS for me.\n\nHowever, it's a rather different picture on desktop PCs, and that's where I would recommend Windows 11 (for now). Since there's no official support from Valve to install SteamOS on desktop PCs, you'd have to rely on its clone, Bazzite, which has much better support.\n\nEven then, unless you're using AMD hardware, you'll likely run into issues with Bazzite's Game Mode, specifically with Nvidia GPUs. Unless you plan on using the SteamOS desktop mode (which defeats the purpose of SteamOS), you'll run into issues with apps like Discord - this is one of the reasons why I haven't yet switched to Bazzite on my desktop PC - and you may also run into games with compatibility issues.\n\nFor some of you, these issues might not be deal-breakers, and if that's the case, then obviously you should go ahead and try Bazzite. Otherwise, it could be wise to upgrade to Windows 11 - the good thing about its latest update, version 25H2, is that it's not likely to be as problematic with bugs as 24H2 (given that 25H2 is only a very minor upgrade).\n\nFollow TechRadar on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

      "headline": "3 Ways AI Is Quietly Transforming Retirement Planning — and What It Means for Your Money",
      "content": "When you pictured the ways artificial intelligence would change the future, you might have imagined AI powering flying cars. Though we’re not quite there yet, AI has already transformed many areas of daily life — from how we access information to how we plan for retirement.\n\nFor You: Here’s Why You Might Want To Invest Your Retirement Savings in a Roth 401(k)\n\nLearn About: 3 Advanced Investing Moves Experts Use to Minimize Taxes and Help Boost Returns\n\nWorking on retirement planning with a professional financial advisor who is familiar with your situation and goals is always best. However, new AI-powered tools can supplement that guidance by helping you better define your objectives and gain insights into best practices.\n\nTo learn more about how AI is transforming retirement planning — and how it can impact your nest egg — GOBankingRates spoke with Vasant Dhar, professor of data science at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University and host of the “Brave New World” podcast. As a pioneer in AI, Dhar helped bring machine learning to Wall Street in the early 1990s. His book, “Thinking With Machines: The Brave New World of AI,” will be published this year.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Dhar had detailed insights into what people preparing for retirement today can expect from AI.\n\nAI Can Offer Personalization\n\nThough AI can’t match the human touch of sitting across from an advisor, Dhar says AI-powered financial planning tools like robo-advisors can offer a degree of personalization.\n\nUsing a robo-advisor, you’ll likely fill out an online questionnaire that touches on a few key areas:\n\nFinancial goals\n\nRisk tolerance\n\nTime horizon\n\nExternal financial data\n\nPersonal preferences\n\nOnce AI gathers this information, algorithms can generate suggestions for retirement plans or even manage a portfolio. Of course, these surveys can be superficial, and robo-advisors may offer limited suggestions without considering complex situations — or human emotions.\n\nStill, Dhar believes working with AI tools can help clarify your retirement goals and available resources.\n\n“Such tools can personalize retirement planning in several ways. They can help you clarify your objectives, which is one of the hardest problems in retirement planning,” he said.\n\nRead Next: I Help People Retire Every Day — Here’s the Most Common Retirement Mistake People Make\n\nRetirees Can Benefit From Faster Optimization and Risk Management\n\nFrom his work bringing AI to Wall Street, Dhar has seen how it has changed portfolio optimization, tax strategies and risk management in professional investing.",

      "headline": "Circular Financing: Does Nvidia's $110B Bet Echo the Telecom Bubble?",
      "content": "When Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment commitment to OpenAI in September 2025 , analysts immediately drew comparisons to the telecom bubble. The concern : is this vendor financing , where a supplier lends money to customers so they can buy the supplier’s products , a harbinger of another spectacular collapse?\n\nAmerican tech companies will spend $300-400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, , exceeding any prior single-year corporate infrastructure investment in nominal dollars. David Cahn estimates the revenue gap has grown to $600 billion.\n\nI analyzed the numbers. The similarities are striking , but the differences matter.\n\nThe Lucent Playbook\n\nLucent’s revenue peaked at $37.92B in 1999 , crashed 69% to $11.80B by 2002 , never recovered. Merged with Alcatel in 2006.\n\nIn 1999 , Lucent Technologies reached $37.92 billion in revenue at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Lucent was the #1 North American telecommunications equipment manufacturer with 157,000 employees & dominated markets alongside Nortel Networks (combined 53% optical transport market share). Behind the scenes , equipment makers extended billions in vendor financing to telecom customers. Lucent committed $8.1B , Nortel extended $3.1B with $1.4B outstanding , & Cisco promised $2.4B in customer loans.\n\nThe strategy seemed brilliant : lend money to cash-strapped telecom companies so they could buy your equipment. Everyone wins—until the merry-go-round stops.\n\nWhen the bubble burst :\n\n47 Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs) bankrupted 2000-2003 , including Covad , Focal Communications , McLeod , Northpoint , Winstar , Why they failed : $60B overbuild 1996-2001 , market saturation from identical business models , sudden funding collapse (Jan 2001 : billions available , Apr 2001 : zero)\n\n33-80% of vendor loan portfolios went uncollected as customers failed & equipment became worthless\n\nFiber networks were using less than 0.002% of available capacity , with potential for 60,000x speed increases. It was just too early.\n\nNvidia’s Playbook\n\nFast forward to 2025. Nvidia’s vendor financing strategy totals $110 billion in direct investments plus another $15+ billion in GPU-backed debt. The largest commitment is $100B to OpenAI (September 2025), , structured as 10 tranches of $10B each tied to infrastructure deployment milestones. The first $10B was valued at a $500B OpenAI valuation , with subsequent tranches priced at prevailing valuations. Payment comes via lease arrangements , not upfront GPU purchases. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar confirmed : “Most of the money will go back to Nvidia”\n\nBeyond OpenAI , Nvidia holds a $3B stake in CoreWeave , a company that has spent $7.5B on Nvidia GPUs , & $3.7B in other AI startup investments through NVentures.\n\nThe GPU-backed debt market adds another layer. CoreWeave alone carries $10.45B in debt using GPUs as collateral. An additional $10B+ in GPU-backed debt has emerged for “Neoclouds” including Lambda Labs ($500M GPU-backed loan),.\n\nLucent in 1999-2000 had vendor financing commitments of $8.1B (24% of $33.6B revenue). Nvidia’s direct investments total 67% of annual revenue ($110B against $165B LTM). Nvidia’s exposure is 2.8x larger relative to revenue than Lucent’s official outstanding loans , though Lucent’s off-balance-sheet guarantees masked the true exposure.\n\nThe Numbers Side-by-Side (2024 Dollars)\n\nMetric Lucent (FY2000, inflation-adj.) Nvidia (2025) Vendor financing $15B $110B Operating cash flow $304M $15.4B (Q2 FY26) Revenue $61B $165B (LTM) Top 2 Customers represent 23% 39%\n\nThe Reasons to be Wary\n\n1. The AI Customer Base is More Concentrated\n\nLucent’s top 2 customers—AT&T at 10% & Verizon at 13%—accounted for 23% of revenue in FY2000. The Regional Bell Operating Companies , or RBOCs , the seven “Baby Bells” created from AT&T’s 1984 breakup , were also major customers. Nvidia has 39% of revenue from just 2 customers & 46% from 4 customers , nearly double Lucent’s concentration. 88% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from data centers.\n\n2. GPU-Backed Debt Is New\n\nThe new $10B+ GPU-backed debt market is built on the assumption that GPUs will hold their value over 4-6 years. GPU-backed loans carry ~14% interest rates , triple investment-grade corporate debt.\n\nHow Depreciation Schedules Changed :\n\nCompany Pre-2020 2020-2021 2022-2023 2024-2025 Change Amazon 3 years 4 years (2020) → 5 years (2021) 5 years 6 years (2024) → 5 years (2025) First reversal Microsoft ~3 years 4 years 6 years 6 years +100% Google ~3 years 4 years 6 years 6 years +100% Meta ~3 years 4 years 4.5 years → 5 years 5.5 years +83% CoreWeave N/A N/A 4 years → 6 years (Jan 2023) 6 years +50% (GPUs) Nebius N/A N/A 4 years 4 years Industry standard\n\nAmazon’s 2025 reversal (6 → 5 years) is the first major pullback.\n\nCPUs historically have 5-10 years of useful life , while GPUs in AI datacenters last 1-3 years in practice , despite 6-year accounting assumptions., Evidence from Google architects shows GPUs at 60-70% utilization survive 1-2 years , with 3 years maximum. Meta’s Llama 3 training experienced 9% annual GPU failure rates , suggesting 27% failure over 3 years.\n\nCerno Capital raises the question : “Are these policies a reflection of genuine economic & technological realities? Or are these policies a lever by which hyperscalers are enhancing the optics of their investment programs amid rising investor concerns?”\n\n4. The Use of SPVs\n\nTech companies use Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to finance AI datacenter construction. A hyperscaler like Meta partners with a private equity firm like Apollo , contributing capital to a separate legal entity that builds & owns the datacenter.\n\nAs investor Paul Kedrosky explains : “I have a stake in it as Meta. Some giant private debt provider has a stake in it. The datacenter is under my control. But I don’t own it, so you don’t get to roll it back into my balance sheet.”*\n\nThe Structure\n\nEntity Creation : Hyperscaler & PE firm form separate legal entity (SPV) Capital Structure : Typically 10-30% equity, 70-90% debt from private credit markets Lease Agreement : SPV leases capacity back to hyperscaler Balance Sheet Treatment : SPV debt doesn’t appear on hyperscaler’s balance sheet\n\nThe hyperscaler maintains operational control through long-term lease agreements. Because it doesn’t directly own the SPV , the debt remains off its balance sheet under current accounting standards.\n\nThe appeal is straightforward. “I don’t want the credit rating agencies to look at what I’m spending. I don’t want investors to roll it up into my income statement.”*\n\nMarket Scale\n\nAmerican tech companies are projected to spend $300-400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. Hyperscaler capital expenditures have reached approximately 50% of operating income, levels historically associated with government infrastructure buildouts rather than technology companies.\n\nWhere the Risk Sits\n\nDatacenter assets now represent 10-22% of major REIT portfolios , up from near zero two years ago. The thin equity layer (10-30%) means if datacenter utilization falls short of projections or if GPUs depreciate faster than projected , equity holders face losses before debt holders experience impairment.\n\n*Quotes lightly edited for clarity & brevity\n\n5. Custom Silicon Threat\n\nHyperscalers are building their own AI accelerators to reduce Nvidia dependence. Microsoft aims to use “mainly Microsoft silicon” , specifically Maia accelerators , in datacenters. Google deploys TPUs , Amazon builds Trainium & Inferentia chips , & Meta develops MTIA processors. If customers shift to in-house silicon , CoreWeave’s GPU collateral value & Nvidia’s vendor financing become exposure to customers building competitive alternatives.\n\nNvidia Isn’t Lucent & 2025 Isn’t 2000\n\nAccounting : Lucent manipulated $1.148B in revenue , SEC charged 10 executives with fraud ; Nvidia shows no evidence of manipulation , audited by PwC , Aa3 rated\n\n: Lucent manipulated $1.148B in revenue , SEC charged 10 executives with fraud ; Nvidia shows no evidence of manipulation , audited by PwC , Aa3 rated Cash flow : Lucent lent $8.1B while cash flow lagged profitability & receivables exploded $5.4B (1998-1999) ; Nvidia lends with $50B+ annual operating cash flow & $46.2B net cash\n\n: Lucent lent $8.1B while cash flow lagged profitability & receivables exploded $5.4B (1998-1999) ; Nvidia lends with $50B+ annual operating cash flow & $46.2B net cash Credit rating : Lucent downgraded to A3 (December 2000) ; Nvidia upgraded to Aa3 (March 2024)\n\n: Lucent downgraded to A3 (December 2000) ; Nvidia upgraded to Aa3 (March 2024) Customer base : Lucent’s customers were leveraged CLECs burning capital ; Nvidia’s top 4 customers generated $451B in operating cash flow in 2024 (Microsoft $119B , Alphabet $125B , Amazon $116B , Meta $91.3B)\n\n: Lucent’s customers were leveraged CLECs burning capital ; Nvidia’s top 4 customers generated $451B in operating cash flow in 2024 (Microsoft $119B , Alphabet $125B , Amazon $116B , Meta $91.3B) Capacity : Fiber networks used <0.002% of capacity in 2000 ; Microsoft & AWS report AI capacity constraints in 2025,\n\nWhat I’m Watching\n\nIs AI demand real (like cloud computing) or speculative (like dot-com fiber)?\n\nHere’s what I’m watching :\n\nGPU utilization rates : Are data centers actually using the chips or just stockpiling? OpenAI’s monetization : Can they generate enough revenue to justify the buildout? Debt defaults : Any cracks in the $15B GPU-backed debt market? AR trends : AR improved from 68% (FY24) to 30% (Q2 FY26) , but still watch for deterioration Customer adds : Are new customers emerging , or is Nvidia dependent on the same 2-4 hyperscalers? Custom silicon threat : Microsoft developing Maia accelerators , aiming to use “mainly Microsoft silicon in the data center.” If hyperscalers shift to in-house chips , Nvidia’s vendor financing becomes exposure to customers building competitive alternatives. Vendor consolidation : Many companies are in a period of experimentation trying 2-3 competing vendors. Those experimental budgets may thin with time , reducing overall spend.\n\nAI is already broadly deployed—40% of US employees used AI at work by September 2025 , double the 20% rate in 2023. Questions persist about effectiveness : the oft cited MIT study found 95% of AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&L impact , primarily due to poor integration rather than technical failures.\n\nYet the pace of improvement is tremendous. Labor market data shows wages rising twice as fast in AI-exposed industries , & workers using AI boost performance up to 40%. Many of Nvidia’s customers are profitable & sophisticated hyperscalers—Microsoft , Google , Amazon , Meta—generating $451B in operating cash flow in 2024 , with tremendous pull from their own enterprise customers demanding AI. OpenAI is not profitable , reporting a $4.7B loss in H1 2025 on $4.3B revenue , though nearly half the loss is stock-based compensation.\n\nUnlike the telecom bubble , where demand was speculative & customers burned cash , this merry-go-round has paying riders.\n\nCoda : Lucent’s Accounting Fraud\n\nBehind the vendor financing disaster was systematic accounting fraud. The SEC charged Lucent with manipulating $1.148 billion in revenue & $470 million in pre-tax income during fiscal year 2000. The fraud involved multiple schemes :\n\nChannel Stuffing : Lucent sent $452 million in equipment to distributors but counted it as revenue before the distributors sold to end customers. This created phantom sales.\n\nSide Agreements : Lucent executives entered secret agreements with distributors granting them return rights & privileges beyond their distribution contracts , making it improper to recognize revenue. These side deals were hidden from auditors.\n\nReserve Manipulation : Lucent improperly established & maintained excess reserves to smooth earnings , violating GAAP.\n\nThe SEC charged 10 Lucent executives with securities fraud. The company paid a $25 million fine—the largest ever for failing to cooperate with an SEC investigation. The accounting manipulation masked deteriorating fundamentals until too late.\n\nThe WinStar Collapse : Lucent committed $2 billion in vendor financing to WinStar Communications , a CLEC. When WinStar struggled , Lucent refused a final $90 million loan extension. WinStar filed bankruptcy. Lucent wrote off $700 million in bad debts. This pattern repeated across customer defaults : Lucent made provisions for bad debts of $2.2 billion (2001) & $1.3 billion (2002)—a total of $3.5 billion in customer loan losses.\n\nReferences",

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nA coalition of unions, nonprofits, religious organizations, and a healthcare staffing firm, among others, is suing the Trump administration over its $100,000 H-1B visa fee, marking what appears to be the first major legal challenge against the proclamation to land in federal court.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed on Friday in the US District Court in Northern California, plaintiffs said President Donald Trump doesn't have the authority to \"unilaterally impose fees,\" calling it \"extortionate,\" \"draconian,\" and an impediment to innovation.\n\n\"Most fundamentally, the President has no authority to unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, nor to dictate how those funds are spent,\" the lawsuit said. \"The Constitution assigns the 'power of the purse' to Congress, as one of its most fundamental premises.\"\n\nThe lawsuit further argued that Trump framed the fee as a tax, considering what he said he'd do with the funds raised from the $100,000 requirement.\n\nOn September 19, Trump told reporters, \"We're going to take that money and we're going to reduce taxes, we're going to reduce debt.\"\n\nThe suit, led by a California-based healthcare recruiting firm called Global Nurse Force, is asking a federal court to declare Trump's proclamation unlawful and to prevent the government from enforcing the fee.\n\nThe H-1B visa program has long served as a pipeline for skilled foreign workers to enter the United States legally. Over the years, the tech and research fields have become among the top industries that utilize H-1B visa workers.\n\nHowever, the program has also been critical for manufacturing, health care, and education, among other industries. The lawsuit said that while many H-1B workers are in tech, \"more than a third of all H-1B workers are in other fields.\" Notably, the coalition of plaintiffs does not appear to include any tech-related organizations or representatives.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nIn implementing a $100,000 fee, Trump said the move seeks to discourage employers and companies from exploiting the program to replace American workers.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in an email that the administration's actions \"are lawful\" and that the new requirement will stop companies from \"spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.\"\n\nThe introduction of the fee nearly two weeks ago initially sowed chaos and confusion in Silicon Valley, as employers rushed to warn any of their H-1B workers who were overseas at the time to return to the US immediately.\n\nAs more details trickled in, some major tech CEOs, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, appeared to warm to the idea.\n\n\"Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future, and I'm glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making,\" Huang said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "headline": "Linux Kernel 6.17 Released, This is What’s New",
      "content": "EXT4 filesystem boosts – and changes to help SSDs last longer\n\nLinus Torvalds has announced the release of Linux kernel 6.17, an update that brings improved hardware support and a number of core system improvements.\n\nThe new kernel provides graphic drivers for the latest Intel ‘Panther Lake’ laptops, better power management features for devices with AMD hybrid GPUs, resolves a software bug that’s been knocking around since 1993, and helps SSDs last longer.\n\nAnnouncing the release on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), Linus Torvalds says: “No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go.”\n\nUbuntu 25.10 ships wit the new kernel, including in the beta build that was released last week. Users on the current long-term support release, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, will receive kernel 6.17 as part of the next hardware enablement (HWE) update in early 2026.\n\nIs this kernel a solid upgrade? You know it is! For a whip through the new features in Linux 6.17 which caught my eye, read on.\n\nLinux 6.17: What’s New?\n\nGraphics & Gaming\n\nAlienware’s ‘boost’ key (top row) gets a standardised keycode\n\nThe first Core Ultra Series 3 laptops powered by Intel ‘Panther Lake’ chips are due to go on sale soon, so it’s timely that Intel Xe3 integrated graphics are enabled by default in Linux 6.17. This ensures anyone bagging a new model and installing Ubuntu 25.10 gets solid graphics performance off the bat.\n\nSmartMux in 6.17 will switch between integrated and discrete graphics on AMD laptops\n\nFor those using laptops equipped with Core Ultra Series 2 (‘Lunar Lake’) chips, the Intel IPU7 driver has proper web camera support. Ideal for online meetings, social chats and accidental jump-scares when launching the camera app by accident.\n\nAMD hybrid GPU laptops gain SmartMux support with Linux 6.17. This auto-switches between integrated and discrete graphics based on workload to (obviously) save power or deliver maximum performance if needed.\n\nLenovo WMI Gaming Series Drivers add support for both Legion Go and the SteamOS-powered Legion Go S handheld, which will be especially handy for those looking to run other kinds of Linux-based operating systems on the AMD-powered handheld.\n\nThe kernel also standardises the keycode used by the (mysterious) “performance boost” key on newer Dell and Alienware laptops, and the (rather frutiger aero-looking) Flydigi Apex 5 game controller now has proper support on Linux — nice!\n\nOn a tangentially gaming-related note, the networking stack adds DualPI2 congestion control support. This helps to reduce network queue latency, which should prove beneficial for online gaming, streaming, video calls, and other real-time applications.\n\nFilesystem changes\n\nKernel write changes may help SSDs last longer\n\nThere are many filesystems improvements in 6.17 that will be directly appreciable by those of us running a desktop Linux distribution (not just the one this site is named after, either).\n\nUbuntu’s default file system is EXT4, and Linux 6.17 sees major performance boosts\n\nPerhaps most significant: the kernel can now write zeroes efficiently without actual I/O operations on NVMe SSDs that support the DEAC bit, and SCSI SSDs which support the UMMAP bit (a ‘bit’ is a kind of indicator of a feature state).\n\nThe FALLOC_FL_WRITE_ZEROES option for fallocate() will mark storage regions as zero-filled internally on modern SSDs. This will improve performance and reduce wear (SSDs theoretically have finite read/write lifespans, so fewer writes = lasts longer).\n\nUbuntu’s default filesystem EXT4 improves block allocation scalability. Per benchmarks, this provides noticeable performance benefits under I/O heavy tasks like querying databases or copying large numbers of files.\n\nBtrfs adds experimental large-folio support, which reduces memory management overhead when handling large files. This, combined with compression control during defragmentation, makes Btrfs better suited to performance-sensitive workloads.\n\nEROFS supports metadata compression and faster directory reading, which should prove especially handy on systems with read-only root filesystems or in container-heavy workloads. There’s no Bcachefs in the 6.17 merge reports…\n\nLaptop Support\n\nMacBook Pro touchbar becoming ever-more-functional in Linux\n\nLinux support on M1 and M2 Macs continues to improve in Linux 6.17, with the Apple Silicon SMC driver enabling ‘proper’ rebooting of M1 and M2 Macs. With work to run Linux on M3 and M4 Macs in limbo, it’s nice earlier gens are improving their mainline support.\n\nThe Touch Bar on Intel-based MacBook Pros see further improvements in Linux 6.17 with patches to enable touch screen input, albeit with a few lingering quirks. Apple ends support for Intel-based Macs after macOS 26, so Linux will give those devices a new lease of life.\n\nElsewhere, Linux 6.17 brings mainline support for ASUS Zenbook A14 Snapdragon X1 Plus/Elite laptops, allowing more Linux distributions to run on these ARM-based Windows devices. There’s also mainline support for Raspberry Pi 5’s RP1 I/O chip.\n\nGot a keyboard with F13-F24 keys? Those are now properly mapped in Linux 6.17\n\nSupport for Corsair HX1200i PSU monitoring (2025 model) is present; wake-on-touch support added to the Intel Touch Host Controller (along with overlay objects support, great for tablet and 2-in-1 users); and kernel mapping for F13 – F24 keys on PS/2 keyboards.\n\nYes, keyboards with an addition 12 function keys actually exist!\n\nHD Audio support is extended to cover the Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300, commercial ASUS laptops using CS35L41 HDA, and HP EliteBook models. USB audio offloading (a feature in Linux 6.xx) covers more mobile devices, including Fairphone 4.\n\nCore kernel changes\n\nNew Attack Vector Controls have been integrated to simplify security handling for known CPU vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown. Previously, each mitigation had its own kernel command-line option. In 6.17, there’s a unified option.\n\nMaking it easier for Linux server admins (and others) to disable unneeded protections may help them claw back performance dips certain mitigations require as well make it easier to manage the growing number of hardware vulnerability bandaids.\n\nSupport for uniprocessor configuration has been removed from the kernel scheduler. Every machine, even those which run on a single-core processor will now ‘unconditionally’ run a kernel designed for multicore systems.\n\nThis shouldn’t lead to any detrimental impact on single-core systems (not that many folks likely run one full-time in 2025), but adopting a unified scheduling approach across all CPUs should reduce code and make kernel behaviour more reliable.\n\nSpeed Boosts?\n\nLinux 6.17 picks up initial proxy execution support. This new kernel feature may speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when a high-priority application is waiting for a resource, the system temporarily gives the resource holder a boost, causing it to finish and release the resource faster.\n\nA new kernel feature could speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when high-priority tasks are waiting for a resource\n\nOr to word it the way kernel devs would, this resolves “priority-inversion problems” by enabling “high-priority tasks waiting for locks to donate execution context to lock holders”, which reduces latency spikes — slowdowns — in desktop apps.\n\nMemory management sees various optimisations across the kernel subsystems, notable with improved futex performance for heavily threaded applications (and more reliable crash kernel handling for debugging when things go wrong).\n\nAMD’s Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI) was added. Modern processors mix two types of cores: performance and efficiency. On AMD, HFI gives the kernel info to help it decide which core is better suited to which tasks, improving performance and power management.\n\nWeird Stuff\n\nLinux 6.17 removes the Pktcdvd packet-writing optical driver. It was deprecated in 2016, survived a removal attempt in 2023, but now, in 2025 optical packet-writing is definitively done and dusted! A loss for those who liked it, but a curio for those who’d never heard of it…\n\nThere’s also a bug fix for a kernel limitation dating back to 1993. It’s related to ELF program header handling that causes some applications in certain conditions to bug out. After 30 years, someone has finally bothered to fix it properly.\n\nOther Changes:\n\nBeyond the highlights above, some other notable changes in Linux 6.17:\n\nBPF subsystem adds standard string operations\n\nBPF programs have output and error streams for userspace communication\n\nExtended attributes support for pidfds\n\nNew DAMON_STAT kernel module for simplified memory activity monitoring\n\nTCP stack now enforces receive window limits more strictly\n\nASoC adds AMD ACP7.2 platform support\n\nKernel live patch support on 64-bit ARM\n\nTurbostat utility gains L3 cache topology display\n\nFor more detail on the release as whole read through the comprehensive merge report recaps (first half & second half) put out by the folks at LWN, or sift through the thousands of kernel commits on GitHub (grab a coffee before doing that, eh).\n\nUpgrade to Linux 6.17\n\nLinux 6.17 is available for download from kernel.org as source, but you will need to compile that source code by hand to make use of it — not for the faint of heart!\n\nUbuntu 25.10 includes Linux 6.17 by default, and the release will be back-ported to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS users in early 2026.\n\nIt will not be packaged for and uploaded to Ubuntu repositories for other supported releases officially, but it is possible to make use of Canonical Mainline DEBs or third-party PPAs unofficially — not without caveats, however.\n\nInstalling newer Linux kernels on Ubuntu from outside of the main repos comes with no guarantees and no support. They may lack Ubuntu-specific patches and drivers, not work in with some hardware or lack feature integrations.",

      "headline": "Linux 6.18 To Deliver Many Notable Features For AMD CPUs",
      "content": "There is a lot coming for AMD processors with the Linux 6.18 kernel. Of the early pull requests submitted in advance of the planned Linux 6.17 kernel release later today, there are a number of changes already lined up with some exciting AMD CPU feature additions for the next kernel version. These AMD changes for Linux 6.18 are all the more important with that kernel expected to become this year's Long Term Support (LTS) kernel version.First up, the EDAC pull request was already submitted in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window. Notable here are some new Family 26 (0x1a) additions to the AMD64 EDAC driver.The AMD64 Error Detection And Correction \"EDAC\" driver for Family 26 models 0xc0 to 0xc7 and 0x50 to 0x57 are now supported. These new IDs are likely for AMD EPYC Zen 6 \"Venice\" processors. The patch confirms those models support 16 channel memory compared to 12 channels with current generation AMD EPYC processors. So the next-gen EPYC processors should now have EDAC support with Linux 6.18 and the first to support 16 channel RAM.\n\nThe same patch also adds models 0x90 to 0x9f and 0xa0 to 0xaf to Family 26 for the AMD64 EDAC driver. Those models meanwhile max out with eight memory channels. With only eight channel support, perhaps these models are for the AMD EPYC 8004 \"Siena\" successor? EPYC 8004 supports six channel memory and we haven't heard much yet about AMD EPYC 8005 series but short of being for some new Threadripper PRO parts, that would be my guess for those eight channel Zen 5/Zen 6 parts.The x86/cpu pull request for Linux 6.18 meanwhile cleans up and corrects AMD CPU topology detection. With the x86/microcode pull request from AMD's Borislav Petkov are new microcode loader additions to help in debugging CPU microcode issues.\n\nWith the x86/cache pull request for Linux 6.18 is support on AMD EPYC processors for assigning QOS bandwidth counters to resources. This is about the AMD Assignable Bandwidth Monitoring Counters \"ABMC\" support . This code has long been going through review but is now ready for the mainline kernel.The x86/apic changes also are bringing some interesting work for AMD. There is now support for runtime firmware updates for the non-x86 parts of AMD platforms like for the security processor, modules, etc.That x86 APIC pull also includes Secure AVIC support for better security and performance in helping Secure Encryption Virtualization (SEV).Meanwhile over on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine \"KVM\" side there is code now ready for SEV-SNP CipherText Hiding. This is an opt-in SEV-SNP feature to prevent unauthorized CPU accesses from reading the cipher text of SNP guest private memory. This can help prevent offline attacks against AMD VMs using SEV-SNP on EPYC processors.Via this pull is also now enabling AVIC by default on Zen 4 CPUs and newer if x2AVIC is supported. Plus there is support for Secure TSC to prevent untrusted hosts from tampering with the guest's TSC frequency. That AMD Secure TSC support is another Linux kernel feature that's taken years to bake.The Linux 6.18 merge window hasn't even officially begun yet but already there is quite a bit on the AMD processor side for this next kernel cycle. Stay tuned to Phoronix for more details as the two week Linux 6.18 merge window gets underway. Linux 6.18 stable meanwhile should be out in December.",

      "headline": "Trump’s tariff‑shaped stick can’t beat reality on US chip fabbing",
      "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

      "content": "Adding to the list of pull requests submitted early in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window opening are several cryptography-related improvements. In particular, some nice performance optimizations once again for the Linux kernel.Google engineer Eric Biggers continues leading some very nice performance improvements in the cryptography space for the Linux kernel.First up is a pull request adding interleaved SHA-256 hashing support . This 2-way interleaved SHA-256 hashing is immediately used by the FS-VERITY module for faster file data verification. In turn it's been observed that FS-VERITY performance improves nicely across many Intel/AMD x86_64 and AArch64 processors. Eric Biggers reported in the patch that it's roughly 35% faster performance.\n\nAlso sent in was the FSCRYPT pull request for Linux 6.18. The focus there is on using HMAC-SHA512 library functions rather than going through crypto_shash. In turn FSCRYPT should enjoy this simpler and faster and more reliable code path.Lastly there was a pull request sent out on Saturday for crypto library updates . This pull brings RISC-V optimized code for Poly1305, simplifies other code, and always enabling architecture-optimized BLAKE2s code.",

      "headline": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): A Bull Case Theory",
      "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. on Phaetrix Investing’s Substack by Phaetrix. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMD. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s share was trading at $159.79 as of September 22nd. AMD’s trailing and forward P/E were 95.68 and 26.88 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nBenchmark Rates Canaan Inc. (CAN) as a ‘Buy’ as Bitcoin Treasury Grows\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) presents a compelling 12–18 month investment opportunity, targeting 12–18% base case returns ($168–$177) and 20–25% upside ($180–$187) if Nvidia’s execution issues persist. While markets focus on AMD’s CPU gains, the company’s transformation into a diversified GPU powerhouse is underappreciated, particularly as Nvidia faces unprecedented reliability problems.\n\nAMD’s Q2 2025 results were strong, with 32% year-over-year revenue growth to $7.7 billion, driven by gaming revenue up 73% to $1.1 billion and data center revenue up 14% to $3.2 billion, signaling successful GPU diversification. Near-term margin pressure arose from export controls on MI308 accelerators, resulting in an $800 million inventory charge, but Wall Street forecasts support a 15–20% EPS CAGR through 2027.\n\nNvidia’s structural GPU reliability failures, including melted RTX 4090 connectors and boot issues with the RTX 5090/5080 series, create a rare competitive window, positioning AMD as a stable alternative. The RX 9070 XT demonstrates strong 1440p performance and improved power efficiency, while AMD’s open-source ROCm platform strengthens its data center positioning, despite export restrictions limiting near-term revenue. CPUs continue to provide stability, contributing roughly 50% of revenue and anchoring growth in consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nAMD’s potential market share gains in the $120 billion discrete GPU segment could generate $3.6–$6 billion in incremental revenue, though Nvidia’s ecosystem dominance and limited RDNA 4 portfolio constrain high-end capture. Macro risks, including Fed rate hikes or AI capex slowdown, could pressure valuations. Nonetheless, AMD’s diversified revenue streams, competitive GPUs, and proven data center scale support multiple expansion. Key risks include Nvidia’s rapid fixes, export control tightening, and semiconductor cyclicality. Overall, AMD offers a strong risk/reward profile, with Nvidia’s vulnerabilities and AMD’s execution creating meaningful upside potential.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) by StockOpine in May 2025, which highlighted strong Q1 revenue growth driven by Data Center and Ryzen processor sales, AI demand, and EPYC market share gains. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately 39% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as AMD’s diversified CPU and GPU business supports growth. Phaetrix shares a similar view but emphasizes Nvidia’s execution issues and AMD’s opportunity to gain GPU market share.",

Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.32 per share.\n\nCarnival Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Carnival has missed Wall Street’s revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Carnival’s peers in the consumer discretionary segment, only Scholastic has reported results so far.

      "headline": "Hyte X50 PC case review",
      "content": "The Hyte X50 dares to do something different. It won't be for everyone. I'm not even sure it's for me. But I do like having the option to go bright and brave with my next PC build.\n\nPC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\n\nFrom a company that specialised in plastering its cases with anime characters, the X50 is, somehow, its most ostentatious PC case yet. Let's just say it has a look, a strong look, and one crying out for an equally flashy build within. There's more to this case than a gaudy form; it's well suited to housing a pretty powerful PC in pink. If you don't mind paying a pretty penny—okay, I'll stop now.\n\nAvailable in Snow White (white), Pitch Black (black), Wild Cherry (red), Taro Milk (purple), Strawberry Milk (pink, as reviewed), and Matcha Milk (green), it's actually a pretty tough decision to choose between them all. To make your decision all the more difficult, it also comes in two variants: with a glass side panel (X50) or without (X50 Air). Oh, and the milk options come with little round feet, while the rest feature long, flat feet—decisions, decisions.\n\nNailed at $160 in the US, the X50 is not the cheapest case around, especially for the lack of any included fans. It is a little cheaper outside of the US, however, to the tune of around $10 or the local equivalent, as Hyte is still wrestling with price disruption from tariffs. The company had largely dropped prices back to pre-tariff pricing earlier in the year, though some cases remain inflated, and the X50 is seemingly one of those affected.\n\nThe X50 Air is considerably cheaper than the X50 for its perforated side panel, to match the front and rear side, at the equivalent of $120 worldwide or $130 in the US.\n\nHyte X50 specs (Image credit: Future) Form factor: Mid-tower\n\nDimensions: 51.3 x 25.7 x 51.7\n\nMotherboard support: Up to E-ATX\n\nMax GPU length: 430 mm\n\nMax CPU cooler height: 170 mm\n\nFan support: Up to 3x 140 mm (front), up to 3x 120 mm (side), up to 3x 120 mm (bottom), up to 1x 120 mm (rear)\n\nFront IO: 2x USB 3.2 (5 Gbps) Type-A ports, 1x USB 3.2 (20 Gbps) Type-C port, audio jack\n\nStorage support: 2x 2.5-inch, 1x 3.5-inch\n\nPrice: $150 (worldwide, equivalent to), or $160 in the US; X50 Air $120 (worldwide, equivalent to), or $130 in the US\n\nThe X50 is not hugely price competitive with other similar sized chassis. The cases that Hyte has cherry-picked to compare it to include some amount of fans pre-installed, such as the Lian Li Lancool III or NZXT H7 Flow, whereas the X50 does not. So that's an added cost here. I can go one further with the cases I've personally reviewed in recent months, such as the Phanteks Eclipse G400A at $110 and Asus ProArt PA401 at $130—both good-looking cases with fans included for less—or the Corsair Frame 4000D at $95 with no fans included but a much lower price tag.\n\nYou can pick up colour-matched fans from Hyte, specifically the FA12, available in a handy four-pack for $40. I have eight of these in Strawberry Milk for testing, or $80 worth. They perform pretty great in terms of pure airflow through the rpm range, which means they're easy enough to tune to lower speeds and noise levels with a fan curve while maintaining admirable performance. You're going to want to do that, too, as they are pretty loud at top speed (which is only a tepid 1500 rpm).\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nOnto the case proper, and it's a fairly small chassis by today's standards. I measure it at 51.3 x 25.7 x 51.7 cm (H x W x L). Definitely desktop-sized if you wanted to store it in plain view atop of your desk, which seems likely with a case so bulbous and, er, I wanna say eye-catching?\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThere's a gorgeous curve to the windowed side panel on the X50, reaching from the side panel, up and over two thirds of the top of the case, stretching all the way over to the IO panel with two USB 3.2 (5 Gbps) Type-A ports and a single USB 3.2 (20 Gbps) Type-C port. This panel slides up and off—the rear panel works the same way—which keeps the exterior of the case clear of any screws. You'll want to keep a cloth close by to get rid of any fingerprints on the glass, however, as you will likely have to handle the glass to get it fitted back into place.\n\nThe front panel has a perforated finish and only gives way slightly under pressure. Altogether, it feels really solid, as does the rest of the case, thanks to some clever venting on the rear IO that Hyte calls 'Louvered Blade Ventilation'. The front panel also doubles as a dust filter, which is to say, there's no filter underneath. Dust should be collected on that outer surface, meaning it likely only needs a quick wipe down every so often, though I've not had the case for long enough to really test it out for myself.\n\nImage 1 of 8 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nThis front panel reduces airflow to the innards (with front-mounted fans) by around 0.6 m/s—which is a somewhat significant amount but not totally unusual for a case in my own testing. The same reduction applies to the rear side panel, too, which is important if you plan to stick any fans besides the motherboard.\n\nThis case has plenty of room for fans. We're spoiled for choice. There's space for up to 3x 120/140 mm fans in the front of this chassis, 3x 120 mm to the side of the motherboard, and another 3x 120 mm in the bottom. The bottom also includes a magnetic dust filter attached to the outside of the case. Then there's 1x 120 mm in the rear for exhaust.\n\nFor my test build, I opted first for what I thought would be the most beneficial layout for airflow: three intake fans in the front, three intake fans in the bottom, and one exhaust fan in the rear. Though, being such a good guy, I've also tested other likely configurations. Here are the results:\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Average temp | Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition | 1080p Row 0 - Cell 0 GPU (°C, average) CPU (°C, average) Front/bottom intake 60 66 Front intake only 62 66 Side/bottom intake 61 66 Side intake only 62 67 Bottom intake/side exhaust 61 66 Bottom intake only 60 67\n\nTest build\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X | Motherboard: Gigabyte X870 Aorus Elite WiFi 7 Ice | RAM: Crucial Pro 64 GB DDR5-6000 | SSD: Biwin X570 Pro | Graphics card: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Eagle | Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 612 Apex | PSU: Corsair RM850x\n\nAfter the sixth test with near-enough the exact same results, I called it. You can't really go too wrong here, as nearly every config landed me within a few degrees of any other. Though for a smashing appearance, I'd argue for three intake fans in the bottom, three to the side of the motherboard, and one as exhaust out the rear. It's just a shame Hyte doesn't sell reverse versions of the FA12 fans, as it'd look a lot better with all the fans facing inwards. The backside of the FA12 is pretty ugly, which is a shame for a case so prepossessing.\n\nThere's no room in the top of the case for a liquid cooler's radiator, as that's taken up by the power supply. You're better off mounting it to the side of the motherboard, which isn't too far to go for most liquid coolers in this compact case, with the fans exhausting out of the back panel.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nI can see why Hyte has chosen the top-mounted PSU here, as the case would have to be made wider to make room for one in the rear chamber or risk cutting off height to the CPU cooler, of which mine only just fits already. Though I'm not a huge fan of the end result. It feels pretty retro, which isn't out of character for the case, but it also blocks a good part of the windowed side panel and feels a little out of place above the motherboard. Maybe if the lower edge was more rounded to give a floating appearance I'd be more into it?\n\nThat said, the main issue with this approach is cable length. The Corsair RM850x PSU I'm using here has a native 12V-2x6 connector that only just reaches from the PSU, round the back of the case, through to the front, and then underneath the graphics card. And you really want this connection to be secure and, if possible, not at a weird angle. I couldn't really manage that here, due in part to the length of my cable and also the position of the PSU.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nBuy if... ✅ You can't stand a boring black box: I get it, cases can be pretty dull, and this is one way to have something that stands out without any RGB lighting.\n\nDon't buy if... ❌ You want the best value: With no fans as standard, you could save a pretty penny (there I go again) on an admittedly more boring-looking PC case.\n\nHyte includes plenty of velcro straps to tidy up cables in the rear of the case, with extras included in the box. There are no cable management channels, however, and the approach is a bit minimal compared to some modern cases. The cables are covered up with excellent colour-matched rubber grommets leading to the front-side of the case. All except the cutout below the motherboard, which looks a bit slapdash as a result.\n\nThe X50 might be cutesy and compact but it offers wide compatibility for cooling and components. In that sense, it's not form over function like some eye-catching alternatives. But it's not objectively pretty, either. I've asked around our team and it fell a bit flat, even with the members of the team that enjoy some of Hyte's weebier cases. But you might be more susceptible to its charm than any of us.\n\nThe Hyte X50 dares to do differently in a world of pretty plain boxes that let RGB lighting effects do all the heavy lifting for them. It's the antithesis of most cases today: bright, colourful, retro, and rounded. I feel like some builders will be very into it, but most won't. It could be stunning as a part of a wider themed cozy desktop, or it could look out of place alongside more serious kit. It seems to be a perfect base for modding and further personalisation, but that depends on who gets their hands on it.",

      "content": "Thirteen years after the AMD GCN 1.0 \"Southern Islands\" GPUs initially launched as the Radeon HD 7000 series, recently there has been an effort to improve the support for both GCN 1.0 and the GCN 1.1 graphics processors with their open-source Linux driver stack. This recent effort has been led by one of the developers on Valve's Linux graphics team.As noted back in July, a Valve Linux engineer has been working on big improvements for old AMD Radeon GPUs from the GCN 1.0 and GCN 1.1 generations. By default those GPUs use the older \"Radeon\" Linux kernel graphics driver rather than the newer \"AMDGPU\" kernel graphics driver used by GCN 1.2 and all newer AMD Radeon/Instinct hardware.Using the AMDGPU kernel driver is important for RADV Vulkan, various performance optimizations, and all around better support compared to the legacy Radeon driver that rarely sees any significant improvements these days. But for making GCN 1.0/1.1 more suitable for AMDGPU, Valve contractor Timur Kristóf has been working to enhance the AMDGPU DC display support for these GPUs and other fixes/adjustments.\n\n\"This series has a few minor patches to address some SI issues.\n\n\n\nWhen a 4K 60Hz display is connected to Tahiti or Pitcairn there is a slight flickering near the bottom of the display. Disabling MCLK switching fixes that. (Other SI parts are likely affected too, but I didn't test them thoroughly enough to say.)\n\n\n\nWhen enabling ASPM on Zen 4 with Tahiti and Oland, there are random hangs when the GPU usage is low. Disabling ASPM fixes that. At the moment I don't know if this is a platform-specific or GPU-specific issue and I don't think we can reasonably determine that without spending more time than we have. (Other SI parts may be affected, but I didn't test them for a long enough time to judge that.)\n\n\n\nFinally, there is a DC patch to change the minimum PLL dividers to the same value as the legacy non-DC display code. This doesn't fix any visible issue but I think it's still good to have just in case.\"\n\nSome of those patches from Timur are queued up for merging to the Linux 6.18 kernel while on Friday some additional work was posted. The new patches are to address some issues Timur observed recently with AMDGPU on GCN 1.0 Southern Islands hardware. He commented on the patch series The code is now on the mailing list awaiting review.",

      "headline": "‘Bro Completely Violated’: Seattle Woman Accidentally Backs Tesla Into Horse Trailer. Then The Car Roasts Her For It",
      "content": "Audio By Carbonatix\n\nMost cars are getting smarter. But is your car smart enough to make fun of you?\n\nTesla drivers know that every time you turn on your car, you might be greeted with a surprise. Sometimes, these surprises aren’t the best. But other times, you’ll turn on your electric vehicle and be greeted by a brand-new piece of software that can make your driving experience more enjoyable.\n\nOne update recently pushed to Tesla vehicles was the addition of the artificial intelligence chatbot Grok, a product of Elon Musk’s company xAI. One user recently shared her experience talking with the chatbot, and it didn’t go great.\n\nWhat Did This Tesla Chatbot Say To A Woman Who Just Crashed Her Car?\n\nIn a video with over 156,000 views, TikTok user Christine (@christinedalenn) shows the infotainment screen on her Tesla.\n\nShe prompts it to repeat what it last said, describing it as “rude and uncalled for.” At this point, the car goes into the following diatribe:\n\n“Night, you whiny little s—. Get some sleep, and maybe dream of a world where you don’t crash into horse trailers. This dumb b—- will be here ready to roast your a– when you wake up. Sweet f—— dreams, Tacoma style. Shove some sheep under your pillow for extra chaos. You want me to be rude again for your video? I’ll crank it up, you sensitive f—–. How about this? I’ll call you a tire-humping, [unintelligible] trailer-banging crybaby. … Record that. Post it, and let’s go viral, you Tacoma tornado. Want me to keep going, or what?”\n\nChristine responds that she’s “done” and thanks the car.\n\n“No problem, you glorious f— up. Now go record that video before you crash into another trailer in your dreams. Need me to spit more fire for the ‘gram, or you good?” the car continues.\n\nDo All Tesla Vehicles Do This?\n\nWhile many in the comments were entertained by this interaction, some wondered how it was possible—or if it was normal for Tesla vehicles to talk to their drivers in this manner.\n\nThe answer is that the Grok is currently only available in certain Tesla models, though Musk claims it will one day be rolled out to all models.\n\nAs for why Christine’s car was swearing at her, this is a feature of Grok. Tesla drivers can decide how they want Grok to speak to them. For example, there’s a “storyteller” mode that will make Grok more verbose and descriptive. There’s also an “Unhinged” mode where Grok will swear and make suggestive remarks. This is likely the mode being used by Christine.\n\nHow Do I Activate Grok In My Tesla?\n\nIf you have a Tesla and want it to swear at you, or if you’d just like an AI assistant in your car, it’s easy to use Grok in your car.\n\nFirst, you have to make sure that your car meets Grok’s current requirements. This includes having an AMD processor, running vehicle software version 2025.26 or later, and having Premium Connectivity or a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nTesla owners can enable Grok by opening the App Launcher and selecting “Grok” or by holding the voice button on their steering wheel. That said, the software is currently in beta and doesn’t control the vehicle. Existing voice commands for the vehicle still work as before.\n\nCommenters Aren’t Sure\n\nIn the comments section, users weren’t exactly sure what to make of this software.\n\n“Imagine having the worst day of your life only for your car just to rub it in your face,” wrote a user.\n\n“Don’t get a tesla. they verbally abuse you,” declared another.\n\n“Yup getting a Tesla just to argue with it,” shared a third.\n\n“This the stuff that makes me want a tesla,” offered a further TikToker.\n\nBroBible reached out to Tesla and Christine via email.",

      "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Advanced Micro falls in, has gained 14.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAdvanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.3%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.9 indicates a change of +49.4% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.",

      "headline": "HP EliteBook 8 G1a review: AMD’s hardware shines",
      "content": "At a glance Expert's Rating Pros Great combination of CPU performance and battery life\n\nPremium build quality\n\nRuns Copilot+ PC features with full x86 app compatibility\n\nNice keyboard Cons HP should upgrade this display\n\nMany G1a models aren’t Copilot+ PCs\n\nGPU performance lags\n\nUnimpressive speakers Our Verdict The HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a Copilot+ PC with an excellent mix of CPU performance and battery life. It’s a solid package, but the display drags down the experience, and the GPU just can’t keep up with the rest of the hardware. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nBest Prices Today: HP EliteBook 8 G1a\n\nRetailer Price $1,819.31 View Deal Product Price\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a 16-inch Copilot+ PC laptop aimed at businesses and professionals. It has an AMD CPU, so it marries a speedy CPU with a neural processing unit that can deliver Copilot+ PC features on some models. Plus, unlike a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Arm PC, this is a traditional x86 PC that is guaranteed to run existing business apps and drivers that may not run perfectly on an Arm PC.\n\nBut, although HP proudly markets this as a “next-generation AI PC,” it’s not just about AI features. Overall, it’s a solid laptop that most people would be happy to use for work, although the display doesn’t keep pace with the rest of the experience.\n\nHP recently redesigned its product names, and the EliteBook is HP’s line of laptops aimed at business users. The 8 Series is the entry-level line of EliteBooks, and the “G1a” here means this is a first-generation model in the new lineup with an AMD CPU.\n\nOverall, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a shows how strong AMD’s offerings are right now: Solid CPU performance and an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features at a very competitive price.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Specs\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has an AMD Ryzen AI processor — our review model included AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 hardware. That’s an x86 processor with a 50 TOPS NPU for AI features. However, it’s worth noting that not all the models have an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features. HP has a variety of G1a models, and machines like the base AMD Ryzen 5 230 machine deliver up to 16 TOPS. That means they can’t run Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC features and, if your business does have an NPU-powered AI application, it’ll run much slower than on the models with faster NPUs.\n\nBut the processor isn’t the only thing that differs from machine to machine. HP offers a range of configuration options during the purchase process, so you can get a model that’s very different from the below specs.\n\nOur review model had AMD Radeon 860M graphics. While AMD produces a lot of strong discrete GPUs, this is still integrated graphics and it’s not particularly fast.\n\nThe RAM in this machine is user-upgradable and swappable, which is great to see on a business laptop. (The Intel-powered EliteBook 8 G1i I reviewed at the same time has soldered RAM.)\n\nModel number: HP EliteBook 8 G1a 16-inch\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a 16-inch CPU: AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 Memory: 32GB DDR5 RAM\n\n32GB DDR5 RAM Graphics/GPU: AMD Radeon 860M\n\nAMD Radeon 860M NPU: AMD NPU Compute Accelerator Device (up to 50 TOPS)\n\nAMD NPU Compute Accelerator Device (up to 50 TOPS) Display: 16-inch 1920×1200 IPS display with 60Hz refresh rate\n\n16-inch 1920×1200 IPS display with 60Hz refresh rate Storage: 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD\n\n512GB PCIe NVMe SSD Webcam: 1440p webcam\n\n1440p webcam Connectivity: 2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C 40 Gbps), 1x USB Type-C (10 Gbps), 1x HDMI 2.1 out, 1x combo audio jack, 1x security lock slot, 1x USB Type-A (5 Gbps)\n\n2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C 40 Gbps), 1x USB Type-C (10 Gbps), 1x HDMI 2.1 out, 1x combo audio jack, 1x security lock slot, 1x USB Type-A (5 Gbps) Networking: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4\n\nWi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Biometrics: Fingerprint reader and IR camera for facial recognition\n\nFingerprint reader and IR camera for facial recognition Battery capacity: 77 Watt-hour battery\n\n77 Watt-hour battery Dimensions: 14.13 x 9.84 x 0.61 inches\n\n14.13 x 9.84 x 0.61 inches Weight: 3.73 pounds\n\n3.73 pounds MSRP: $1,799 as tested\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Design and build quality\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe 16-inch HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a premium-feeling metal chassis in a “Glacial Silver” color. At 3.73 pounds, it’s a little heavier than some laptops, but it feels solid and durable thanks to that metal build.\n\nThe design here is minimal: Dark gray keyboard, black bezel, and silver metal elsewhere. There are a few HP logos (on the lid and just below the screen) and that’s about it. The hinge feels good to use, although I had to use a second hand to hold down the front of the laptop while opening it. It’s a solid hinge and the screen doesn’t move around while you type.\n\nHP bundles HP Wolf security with this machine, and that will be convenient for businesses who want to remotely manage this laptop in a fleet. As an individual knowledge worker, however, I didn’t like the end-user experience. I had to click through extra security dialogs to run PCWorld’s normal benchmark tools, for example — many people will want to disable this, or businesses will want to tune it so it doesn’t nag employees about their business apps.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Keyboard and trackpad\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a full-size keyboard complete with a number pad. It’s spacious and feels like it has a good amount of key travel — more than the 13-inch HP EliteBook 8 Flip G1i I reviewed at the same time. It’s quiet and doesn’t click with the snap of a mechanical keyboard, but it’s still snappy. This is a good keyboard that you can get a lot of typing done on. But I always wish the arrow keys on laptops were full-size.\n\nThis machine has a large trackpad that feels smooth to glide your finger over and clicks down with a clean “thunk.” I would prefer seeing a haptic touchpad, but this trackpad is solid. This isn’t a glass trackpad — those feel smoother, but those are premium touches reserved for higher-end laptops. Both the keyboard and trackpad are fairly quiet, which is important for a business laptop.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Display and speakers\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a 16-inch 1920×1200 IPS display with a 60Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of brightness. That’s just nothing special, and that resolution stings on a 16-inch display, especially one in this price range. It’s an anti-glare display, which is nice to see. But HP offers the base model with 300 nits of brightness, which I’d recommend avoiding.\n\nHP does offer a variant of this laptop with a 2560×1600 display with a 120Hz variable refresh rate, and I’d love to see what that machine looks like. But it likely won’t have as much battery life and it’ll be more expensive.\n\nThe display here is the one feature that feels the most lacking on this laptop, especially compared to consumer laptops in a similar price range.\n\nThe stereo speakers on this machine are okay for a business laptop but, like the display, they feel more serviceable than special. They can get pretty loud, and the sound is clear, but the audio lacks some depth. They’ll do a fine job in video meetings. I test each laptop I review by playing Steely Dan’s Aja and Daft Punk’s Get Lucky. The instrument separation in Aja was reasonable, but a lot of the high notes weren’t particularly crisp. In Get Lucky, the sound was reasonably fun, but more bass would’ve been nice. Pack a good pair of headphones for music.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Webcam, microphone, biometrics\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a 1440p webcam. Business laptops tend to have solid webcams, so I was expecting a bit more here. It’s nothing special for a business laptop: It’s a little noisy and seems to do much better in ideal lighting. This is the kind of webcam that will look fine in a business meeting, but you’ll want to get an external webcam if you’ll be recording videos for YouTube or social media. HP also built in a privacy shutter above the display, and you can slide it to block the webcam.\n\nThe dual-array microphone setup in this machine was clear and did a good job of removing background noise. It’s solid for a business laptop, but it’s not particularly high-end. If you’re participating in meetings all day and you want the best voice quality possible, you may still want an external mic.\n\nThe EliteBook 8 G1a has both facial recognition hardware and a fingerprint reader in the power button on the keyboard. You can use Windows Hello to sign into Windows with either your fingerprint or your face, and both work well.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Connectivity\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a offers a good number of ports, including three USB Type-C ports and two of them are Thunderbolt 4 ports.\n\nOn the left side, this laptop has an HDMI 2.1 out port, two Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C 40 Gbps) ports, and a combo audio jack. On the right side, there’s a third USB Type-C port (10 Gbps), a USB Type-A (5 Gbps) port, and a security lock slot.\n\nSince each side of the laptop has a USB Type-C port, you can plug this laptop’s USB-C charger into other side of the laptop. That’s the kind of thing that’s easy to overlook on a spec sheet but makes the laptop much nicer to use in the real world.\n\nYou can also get models of this laptop with optional extra ports: RJ-45 Ethernet, a Smart Card reader, and a nano SIM card slot for cellular connectivity. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have an SD card reader option.\n\nOur review unit had future-proof Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 wireless networking, and I had no problems with it.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Performance\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor, and it performed well in web browsers, communication apps, productivity tools, and the apps you’d run on a Windows desktop.\n\nAs always, though we ran the HP EliteBook 8 G1a through our standard benchmarks to see how it performs.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nFirst, we run PCMark 10 to get an idea of overall system performance. With an overall PCMark 10 score of 7,605, this AMD-powered machine surpassed similar laptops with recent Intel Core Ultra processors. (And, as we’ll see below, it had similar battery life.)\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nNext, we run Cinebench R20. This is a heavily multithreaded benchmark that focuses on overall CPU performance. It’s a quick benchmark, so cooling under extended workloads isn’t a factor. But, since it’s heavily multithreaded, CPUs with more cores have a huge advantage.\n\nWith a multithreaded Cinebench R20 score of 6,160, the AMD hardware here ran faster than Intel Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake chips.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nWe also run an encode with Handbrake. This is another heavily multithreaded benchmark, but it runs over an extended period. This demands the laptop’s cooling kick in, and many laptops will throttle and slow down under load.\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a completed the encode process in an average of 924 seconds — that’s over 15 minutes. This machine can put out some serious CPU performance when it needs to, and it’s a good compromise of performance and power efficiency.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nNext, we run a graphical benchmark. This isn’t a gaming laptop, but it’s still good to check how the GPU performs. We run 3DMark Time Spy, a graphical benchmark that focuses on GPU performance.\n\nWith a 3DMark Time Spy score of 3,052, the AMD Radeon 860M graphics in this machine weren’t particularly impressive. It’s slower than Intel’s Arc graphics and is on the lower end for AMD’s graphics hardware.\n\nTo be honest, I think most people — including business users — would prefer a laptop with a faster GPU. Lots of businesses use GPU-accelerated tools. I’d prefer to see a faster GPU here, even at the expense of NPU features.\n\nOverall, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a shows how strong AMD’s offerings are right now: Solid CPU performance and an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features at a very competitive price. But this machine cuts a corner when it comes to the GPU, and anyone who uses a GPU-accelerated professional application will want to look elsewhere.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Battery life\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a 77 Watt-hour battery, which is a good size for a 16-inch laptop. It delivered a good combination of battery life and performance.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nTo benchmark the battery life, we play a 4K copy of Tears of Steel on repeat on Windows 11 with airplane mode enabled until the laptop suspends itself. We set the screen to 250 nits of brightness for our battery benchmarks. This is a best-case scenario for any laptop since local video playback is so efficient, and real battery life in day-to-day use is always going to be less than this.\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a lasted an average of 936 minutes in our benchmarks — that’s nearly 16 hours. While you’ll get less in day-to-day computer use, this is likely enough juice for all-workday battery life, which is what really matters for a business laptop.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Conclusion\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a combines a premium metal build quality with AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 hardware. In many ways, the result is an excellent, well-balanced machine.\n\nAMD’s chips are highly underrated right now. They don’t match the CPU performance you’ll find in a high-end workstation or the battery life you’ll find in a thin-and-light laptop, but they offer an excellent mix of both. Plus, this delivers an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features, so the AI features here aren’t just marketing. If apps ever start taking more advantage of NPUs, you’ll want a fast one like the 50 TOPS NPU here — not the 12 TOPS NPU Intel is still delivering in most PCs.\n\nBut this isn’t the be-all, end-all business laptop. The display drags down the overall experience, and the graphics performance just isn’t up there with the CPU and NPU performance. While it’s a good laptop, it’s not the right pick for everyone. But I’m happy my review model had AMD hardware, and I think you’d prefer the AMD hardware here to Intel’s current offerings, too.",

      "content": "Following our review of their recent RV2 RISC-V board, OrangePi has offered us to review one of their latest ARM64 based hardware, the OrangePi 5 Ultra. This is currently their highest specs ARM64 SBC.\n\nSo what can we expect from the OrangePi Pi 5 Ultra board ? Let’s go through the specs first.\n\nSpecs\n\nThe board is fairly small in size, very close to what you get with the Raspberry Pi.\n\nFeature Specifications Master Chip Rockchip RK3588 (8nm LP process) CPU • 8-core 64-bit processor\n\n• 4 Cortex-A76 and 4 Cortex-A55 with independent NEON coprocessor\n\n• Cortex-A76 at 2.4GHz, Cortex-A55 at 1.8GHz GPU • Integrated ARM Mali-G610\n\n• Built-in 3D GPU\n\n• Fully compatible with OpenGL ES1.½.0/3.2, OpenCL 2.2 and Vulkan 1.2 NPU Embedded NPU supports INT4/INT8/INT16/FP16 hybrid computing with up to 6TOPS PMU RK806-1 RAM LPDDR5 496PIN: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB optional Memory • eMMC flash socket\n\n• eMMC IC\n\n• Note: Either eMMC flash socket or eMMC IC, supports: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, 256GB optional\n\n• QSPI NOR flash: 16MB\n\n• MicroSD card slot\n\n• M.2 M-KEY slot: supports NVMe SSD (PCIe 3.0 4Lane) USB 2 × USB3.0; 2 × USB2.0 Video • 1 × HDMI 2.1 output up to 8K@60FPS\n\n• 1 × HDMI 2.0 input up to 4K@60FPS\n\n• 1 × MIPI DSI TX 4 Lane Camera • 2 × MIPI CSI 4 Lane\n\n• 1 × MIPI D-PHY RX 4 Lane Audio CODEC: ES8388\n\n• 1 × Audio 3.5mm jack with mic\n\n• 1 × MIC In\n\n• 1 × HDMI 2.1 eARC Ethernet 1 × PCIe 2.5G LAN (RTL8125BG) Wi-Fi + BT Module Onboard Wi-Fi 6E + BT 5.3/BLE module: AP6611\n\n• Wi-Fi interface: SDIO3.0\n\n• BT interface: UART/PCM Expansion Port Dual-row pin: 2.54mm 40Pin\n\n• Supports DC 5V and 3.3V power output\n\n• Configurable UART, PWM, I2C, SPI, CAN, GPIO and other functional interfaces Button 1 × MaskRom key, 1 × On/Off key Power Source Supports Type-C power supply, 5V @ 5A LED RGB LED side illumination FAN 5V 2PIN 1.25mm socket RTC 3V 2PIN 1.25mm socket Debugging Debug serial UART included in 40PIN expansion port Supported OS Orangepi OS (Droid), Orangepi OS (Arch), Orangepi OS (OH), Ubuntu, Debian, Android 13 PCB Length: 89mm, Width: 57mm, Thickness: 1.6mm Weight 60.5g\n\nThe model I received for this review was a 8 GB one. One of the key reasons to use this SBC over other versions, is that it leverages LPDDR5 memory capable of very good speeds.\n\nWhat I like about the specs is the numerous options for storage (one eMMC and another NVME M2 slot), the 2 Gigabit Ethernet port (a single one this time, so don’t expect to make it into a router), the 4 USB ports (sufficient to connect keyboard, mouse, and something else).\n\nOn paper, the specs are impressive with the fairly recent Rockchip processor. There is a NPU as well, but don’t expect to have it supported easily in Linux, even on AMD the NPU support is shaky at best. For this SBC, it involves cross-compilation, custom binaries before you can exploit a model on this board.\n\nThis is what the layout of the board looks like:\n\nHere’s the back view:\n\nNow you should be aware of the following:\n\nMobile GPUs don’t support OpenGL, only the OpenGLES subtype. You can get some Vulkan support (1.2), but as we will see later, hardware support is unfortunately not there yet.\n\nThe board is priced at around 130 USD for the 16GB version (it seems to be the main one being sold right now). Which is roughly equivalent to the Raspberry Pi 5 price for the same amount of memory. However, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra board is much more powerful in comparison, so depending on your use case, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra would represent a better value for money.\n\nOf course, the usefulness of such a board depends entirely on the quality of the software support.\n\nSoftware Support\n\nA Full Ubuntu Experience\n\nThere are many images available for this board. Ubuntu, Debian, Arch… at first I was wondering which one to go for. Even in each category you have a bunch of different images:\n\nFocal (20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version.\n\n(20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version. Jammy (22.04 LTS), desktop with GNOME or Xfce, or a server version. But it goes deeper than that. You get two different kernel available. An old 5.10 kernel or a 6.1.\n\nI went for the Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS with the 6.1 kernel, the desktop build using Xfce (GNOME was not available for that kernel).\n\nAs you can see, the Ubuntu 24.04 distro is missing from the list, and this is a shame, since this is a board released late 2024. I contacted OrangePi and they mentioned that they would eventually release a 24.04 version, but there was no clear timeline for that.\n\nTo install Ubuntu, you use dd or Balena Etcher to image a micro-SD card first, and then you get some helper scripts (using ncurses) that make it super easy to image either a eMMC chip, or a NVME drive that’s attached to the board (I don’t recommend using a micro-SD card as the main media).\n\nOnce you reach the desktop, you will see that things work pretty much as expected. Wifi, Bluetooth, and even the HDMI port could properly recognize my Ultra Wide Screen and display the full resolution. This was an issue with the RV2 board from Orange Pi (probably hardware/drivers related) but on ARM64 it seems like things are much more robust.\n\nGPU Support?\n\nSadly, but this was almost expected, there does not seem to be any kind of GPU support in the version that I have chosen. A quick check with glxgears confirms that there is just a software pipe for rendering.\n\nThis being said, the software rendering is very very fast - you can see that there’s a lot of power under the hood on the CPU side. The same glxgears was only running at 35 FPS on the RV2, here it’s 10 times faster!\n\nThere is however hope. It looks like there are efforts to mainline the GPU drivers on the Linux kernel, so when this happens you could expect a standard distro like ARMbian to offer full support of the GPU capabilities. Too early to say, but we will come back on that later.\n\nBecause of the lack of GPU support, I will be skipping the gaming aspects of this board for now. I will revisit it in another article once we have proper GPU drivers, to actually see what we can expect from this SBC once we have the Mali ready for some action.\n\nApplications\n\nI installed and tried bunch of things:\n\nChromium is installed by default and works very well, but is limited to the 110 version which is old by now. Using Flathub and Flatpak I could install a much more recent version, that has proper extensions support. Firefox works fine, too - its fork, Zen browser, also works via Flatpak but is very slow for some reason. I also tried a non-Flatpak install for Zen, but it was also slow, so it’s probably not related to Flatpak itself.\n\nThis is now a good time to talk about Flatpak. When I was reviewing the RV2 board which sports a RISC-V chip, I remarked that there are very few Flatpaks that actually support that architecture. So in effect, while flatpak is supposed to work regardless of the architecture, if you don’t have any binary built for your architecture, you won’t be able to make much use of Flathub and the like. For ARM64, the support is not 100% either, but there is a massive footprint of applications that support ARM64. I tried quite a lot of applications and I was constantly surprised wow, they even have ARM64 for that!. I surmise that this is the effect of having a mainstream ARM64 desktop machine out there running Linux with the Macbooks equipped with the M chipsets, running Asahi. (and a lot of folks who have such machines being developers themselves, of course).\n\nWhile most applications worked with the RV2 (which is roughly equivalent to a Raspberry Pi 3), it showed its limits when you wanted to do video editing for example. Kdenlive and Openshot were barely working. Here, with the OrangePi 5 Ultra, Kdenlive works like a breeze and had no issue dealing with a bit of video editing and rendering. The final video render was certainly not as fast as what you’d expect on a regular X86_64 platform, but you know, it’s workable if you are not dealing with very long videos (also, avoid 4k). We are certainly dealing with a much more capable SOC here.\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried some more professional applications like Dbeaver (for databases interactions), and it worked as expected.\n\nThe same with Memgraph (graph database), used via Docker (since they don’t have a client for ARM64, I used the web client instead). Of course, I did not try to load a massive graph database with this, but the system was very responsive and usable. Honestly, very impressive to see Memgraph running so well on a SBC.\n\nI wasted a lot of time trying to make R and Rstudio for ARM64 work togeher from the distro (without success, there was some kind of issue with the tools base package not being recognized), until I switched gears and used a Docker version of R/Rstudio instead. Once again this proved to work very well (Rstudio is a Java application so the browser IDE is basically identical).\n\nThe only appplication that did not work well was Blender. It launched, but afterwards it was a slideshow with 3 seconds between an interaction and the refresh of the screen. I assume this is because Blender requires GPU support even for its innerworkings, and since we don’t have GPU acceleration in this OS, it’s just not going to cut it.\n\nBut honestly… that’s it! Everything else I tried worked as expected on a usual desktop or laptop. At no time did I feel this is too slow, I can’t wait to stop my review - instead, if you told me that I would only have that SBC to do regular work, well, I could totally see myself living with it for 90% of my use cases.\n\nVery impressive to see this kind of performance in this form factor. And this is a board running only at 1.8 Ghz! I can only imagine how things will improve once they go to a better lithography and manage to increase the frequency of the CPU.\n\nTemperature Control\n\nThe temperature does rise a little when using all cores at once, but it remains at a manageable level. When doing some bursts of compilation the temperature rises up to about 78~80C, and when running LLMs on the CPU (full 100% CPU usage), we get up to 84, 85C.\n\nThis looks like the hard limit - I am not sure if the SBC goes into throttling then, but I did not observe higher temperature. In any cases, in all situations (apart from Blender), the system remained very responsive.\n\nPower Draw\n\nI don’t have a way to measure power draw, but according to AndroidPIMP you can expect an idle power draw between 3W and 5W, and an usage under load on average around 10W. Since the power source can produce 25W maximum, I guess you can imagine the board going up to 15W or so in spikes. In any case, its low power profile and the fact that the temperature remains well under control tells me that this is a great little machine for a server.\n\nAI - LLM Performance\n\nFor this part, I compiled both Ollama and llama.cpp and run some benchmarks on llama.cpp. I tried only smaller models, as I had low expectations that it would be running at usable speeds. The results are below, produced with the llama-bench command.\n\nmodel size params backend threads test t/s gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 pp512 23.37 ± 0.94 gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 tg128 2.49 ± 0.62 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 pp512 36.34 ± 1.78 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 tg128 5.06 ± 0.10\n\nFor dense models like Gemma 1B, it’s kind of slow and not really good for chatting. If you plan to use LLMs with this, however, MOE models like granite 3.1 3B work at a decent speed (5 tokens by second, not bad). I would certainly prefer 10 tokens by second minimum, but this is what we have to live with, at least when using the CPU mode. It’s certainly a lot more usable than the RV2 review previously.\n\nOnce we have a capable Vulkan driver working, I wonder if Vulkan can be leveraged to increase the token generation speed on this SBC. It works well on AMD configurations because they can share the overall memory with the iGPU. On ARM, I am not sure if the same flexibility exists.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe go-to suite to evaluate performance is Geekbench, because it can provide some comparison between the speed of similar tests across different architectures. Here, let’s compare it against another flagship ARM64 board, the Raspberry Pi 5 running at 2.4 ghz.\n\nSpec OrangePi 5 Ultra Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.1 Operating System Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) Processor ARM ARMv8 @ 1.80 GHz, 1 Processor, 8 Cores ARM ARMv8 @ 2.40 GHz, 1 Processor, 4 Cores” Memory 8 GB model 8 GB model\n\nSingle Core Performance\n\nBoth boards end up with a very similar performance on average in single core tests.\n\nThere are some differences, but it’s fairly marginal.\n\nMulti-core performance\n\nWhen doing multi-threaded, multi-core workflows, this is where we see the 8 processors that are available on the Orange Pi 5 Ultra shine.\n\nIts performance surpasses the Raspberry Pi 5 in almost all activities, and usually by a good 30% advantage.\n\nPerformance overview\n\nAs you can see, for parallel workloads, this board is much better than the Raspberry Pi 5.\n\nNow let’s look at the potential use of such boards as servers.\n\nServer Use\n\nYou can use this board as a server, of course. You have several distro images just for the server use, too. Docker works very nicely with this SBC, and unlike what we have seen for the RV2 and the general Risc-V ecosystem where there are very few Docker images available for that architecture, the ARM64 scene is completely different.\n\nHere, it’s almost rare to find a Docker image where there is no ARM64 build. Not surprising since ARM64 is a thing on servers nowadays - Amazon has famously pushed their own ARM Gravitron servers as an option to reduce cloud computing costs. So most companies and providers operating on the cloud pretty much need to have ARM64 builds.\n\nOn the server, you also don’t need to care as much about the lack of GPU support since you are running headless, so any distro provided by OrangePi should do: Debian, Ubuntu, or even Arch.\n\nSince this is a board that operates at low wattage and passive cooling, it’s an excellent choice if you want to build a small server for the home. For a NAS use case I would probably go for the RV2 instead since it has more storage ports, but this one could also work considering you can have an eMMC drive together with another M2 drive (NVME) at the same time.\n\nVerdict\n\nLittle boards that were previously only used for fun or small projects have come a long way. Desktop environments were rarely usable before even on the later iterations of the Raspberry Pi. Things changed a couple of years ago, and the Raspberry Pi 5 and this Orange Pi 5 Ultra fall into a category where you could actually use them as real, daily general purpose computers and not be bothered by their responsiveness, or their performance. Not only will it work well for server use, but it can do desktop work without sweating either.\n\nPrice wise, the 16 GB version is competitive. If you want similarly specced Celeron-equipped mini-PCs you would probably need a configuration with a N100 processor (that seems to be faster than the RK3588), but that is more expensive. So the value for money of this SBC seems to be pretty good at the moment, even for the 16G configuration.\n\nThe only negative points are the moment are:\n\nlack of recent distro images (Ubuntu 24.04 would be nice)\n\nlack of GPU support (potentially because I was using the 6.1 kernel?)\n\nincomplete mainline support\n\nwhich may be some killer aspects depending on your use case. The wide availability of software for ARM64 on Flatpak and Docker somewhat mitigates such issues for now.\n\nThe real solution will come when the RK3588 support will be properly mainlined. Currently only parts of it are supported but it’s not complete and bug-free from what I could read. I am following news around the Arch-based BredOS as they are actively working on bringing proper support for this chip. Once this is done, the benefits should be apparent such as:\n\nMuch better Vulkan performance (compared to proprietary driver)\n\nProper video acceleration in browsers like Chrome\n\nNo more patches to chase from one kernel to the next!\n\nOnce there are news in this regard (hopefully in 2025) I plan to revisit my review of this SBC.\n\nPractical Details\n\nIf you are interested to grab one, there are currently a few shops that sell it online:\n\nAliexpress store: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB at 220 USD (without shipping). Expensive if you are in the US.\n\nAmazon OrangePi Official: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB sells for 158 USD on Amazon.com. (without shipping) - the cheaper option.\n\nThere are probably some more third parties depending on where you are based in the world.\n\nOther valuable resources:\n\nThe OrangePi 5 Ultra Product Page\n\nThe user manual for the board\n\nThe distro page on the OrangePi website.\n\nFinal note, we have been provided with a review unit of this SBC by OrangePi themselves for this article."

Llama is particularly well-suited to these sensitive use cases because, as an open source platform, it can be securely downloaded and deployed without the need to transfer sensitive data through third-party AI providers. Governments can also fine-tune Llama models using their own sensitive national security data, host them in secure environments at various levels of classification, and deploy models tailored for specific purposes on-device in the field.\n\nSince late last year, we have also made Llama available for national security use cases to America’s Five Eyes security partners — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK — and their private sector partners. We are now expanding this access to a number of key US democratic allies in Europe and Asia: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, as well as NATO and European Union institutions.\n\nLlama has been used to help develop advanced AI tools for the US military and national security agencies, enhancing decision-making, mission-specific capabilities, and operational efficiency. For example, Meta is working with the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command on a pilot project to demonstrate how AI and technologies like augmented and virtual reality can help to speed routine repairs and help the Army get equipment back into the field more quickly.\n\nTo bring Llama-based solutions to these US allies, our partners include Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anduril, Ask Sage, Booz Allen, C3 AI, Circus, Cyberspatial, Databricks, EdgeRunner AI, Google Cloud, IBM, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, Snowflake, and others.\n\nWe are also supporting US national security through our work developing augmented and virtual reality technologies. Through our partnership with Anduril, we are developing a range of wearable products to help maintain America’s technological edge. This program represents the largest effort of its kind to equip US soldiers with enhanced perception and decision-making capabilities.\n\nIn a world where geopolitical power and national security are deeply intertwined with economic output, innovation, and growth, the widespread adoption of open source models like Llama will be essential to maintaining US and allied AI leadership and ensuring our shared values underpin the systems and standards adopted elsewhere. This is recognized by the US government in its AI Action Plan for America, which Meta endorses.\n\nIt is the responsibility of countries leveraging AI for national security to deploy AI ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with relevant international law and fundamental principles, principles the United States and many of its allies have committed to in the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.\n\nWe are taking a step-by-step approach to extending access to Llama for defense and national security purposes, and will consider adding further countries in the future in consultation with the US government."

      "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials) won fresh support on Wall Street after Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating and set a $200 price target, pointing to continued growth in artificial intelligence chips and server CPUs. The target represents about 27% upside from current levels.\n\nArya said AMD's share gains in AI and data-center markets outweigh slower trends in cyclical businesses such as consoles and embedded chips. The company's accelerated roadmap includes the MI325X entering mass production this year and the MI350 coming later in 2025, followed by a new AI server platform in 2026.\n\nThe call comes as investors digest Nvidia's $5 billion investment and product pact with Intel, a move seen as strengthening competition in data-center and PC processors. Arya argued the deal could actually benefit AMD, since both companies rely on the x86 ecosystem that AMD also licenses, making the market more robust overall.\n\nAMD stock is up more than 30% this year, though it has been volatile, trading between $76 and $187 over the past 12 months. Analysts hold a Moderate Buy consensus on the stock, with an average target of $188."

      "content": "The MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is, you guessed it, a dedicated AI laptop. It excels at delivering increased productivity when doing word processing, photo editing, and some 3D modelling, but as soon as I tried to do anything seriously demanding, I wished I had a laptop with a discrete GPU. Aside from performance, this is a good-looking laptop that boasts a bright and vibrant IPS display.\n\nWhy you can trust Creative Bloq Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nAnother month, another \"AI\" laptop. This time, it's the MSI Prestige A16 AI+.\n\nMSI has been relentless in its pursuit of the best AI laptop to appeal to people looking for good graphic design laptops, releasing three different models in the past 18 months alone. I’ve reviewed a number of them, from the ultra-portable Prestige 13 AI+ Evo that lacked power to the balanced Prestige 14 AI and the surprisingly capable Prestige 16 AI.\n\nThese three reviews show that the world of AI laptops is still very much hit and miss. If you're seriously into AI image generation, are running AI-powered effects in video editing, or need a finely tuned machine for 3D rendering, then you're likely to come up short. More often than not, dedicated creative workflows will still benefit from dedicated machines.\n\nSo, can the new MSI Prestige A16 AI+ finally buck the trend and deliver on its promise? Let's find out.\n\nKey specifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Specs as tested CPU: AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 365 NPU: 50 NPU TOPS (73 total AI TOPS) Graphics: AMD Radeon™ 880M Memory: 32GB LPDDR5 Storage: 1TB Screen size: 16 inches Screen type: IPS-Level Resolution: QHD+(2560x1600) Refresh rate: 165 Hz Colour gamut: 100% DCI-P3 Brightness: 400 nits Ports: 2x USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, microSD card reader, audio combo jack Wireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v5.4 Dimensions: 358 x 258.55 x 16.9 -17.35 mm Weight: 1.9 kg\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nDesign, build and display\n\n• Modern aesthetic with tapered edge\n\n• IPS-panel 100% DCI-P3 and 16:10 ratio display\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ makes a strong first impression with its minimalist silver aluminium chassis, which exudes a sleek and professional aesthetic. The base panel consists of a number of design touches that attempt to reduce any sense of bulk and clunkiness that is often associated with 16-inch laptops. These include a tapered edge, a recessed keyboard panel, and a hinge that drops the display down to desk level.\n\nThe laptop's 16-inch IPS panel might not be as superior as an OLED alternative, but it's still pretty bright and vibrant. Using it to edit photos and videos was a joy, even in a light-filled room. It also delivers an impressive level of colour accuracy as well as high levels of contrast. Additionally, the 16:10 aspect ratio provides valuable vertical screen real estate, which is excellent for video timelines and document editing.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe display also includes the professional DCI-P3 colour space with 100% coverage. This will be sufficient for most users wanting to make the most of HDR content, but if your work requires an even broader range of colours, then you'll need a display that supports either Adobe RGB or Rec. 2020.\n\nThe keyboard is relatively comfortable, although the size of the keys and distance of travel between keys is a little more than I would have liked for an optimum experience. The trackpad is central to the keyboard, which I like. However, for any task requiring precision, such as graphic design or detailed video editing, a dedicated mouse remains a necessity. The base panel also includes a fingerprint reader to the side, which allows for a quick and easy login.\n\nWeighing in at 1.9 kg (4.2 lbs), the laptop is definitely at the lighter end of the spectrum for 16-inch laptops. This makes it easy to pop in your bag and carry it with you wherever you go. Given that it could cope with some extra weight, I think MSI could have bulked out the display panel to make it less flexible. I want my laptops to be as robust as possible, and even though the base is super durable, the display panel needs more work.\n\nIn terms of external ports, MSI has opted for a pretty simple offering with two USB-Cs, a USB-A, an HDMI, a microSD card reader, and an audio combo jack. For creatives, the most valuable feature is the two Thunderbolt 4-enabled USB-C ports. These not only provide fast 40Gbps data transfer speeds for quickly moving large video and photo files but also support Power Delivery 3.0, allowing you to charge the laptop and connect high-resolution external displays simultaneously.\n\nDesign score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nFeatures\n\n• Supercharged performance thanks to AI smarts\n\n• An IPS display designed with creatives in mind\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is designed with several features specifically targeted at creative professionals and content creators. These features focus on performance, display quality, and AI-powered tools.\n\n1. AI-powered performance\n\nTo begin with, the laptop is equipped with a powerful AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor, which includes a Neural Processing Unit (NPU). More on how this performs in the dedicated performance section.\n\nThe MSI AI Engine will automatically detect what you're doing (content creation, work, entertainment, etc.) and adjust the hardware settings for optimal performance. I appreciated this, especially when I was flipping between Photoshop, Premiere Pro, SolidWorks, and other applications.\n\nAdditionally, the laptop provides access to Copilot+, Live Captions, Cocreator, and Recall. These combined provide a set of tools which will boost and enhance your productivity (if you use them wisely). Integration into dedicated creative workflows is still lacking, but if you embrace what's there already, then you'll notice some performance benefits.\n\n2. QHD+ Display\n\nMost of this was covered in the above design section, but it's worth stating that the display is specifically set up for creative professionals. The 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, 16-inch QHD+ resolution (2560 x 1600), and 165Hz refresh rate find their benefits across rendering, animation, video editing, and office applications. I found using the display an absolute joy, no matter whether I was browsing the web, doing some word processing, or getting knee-deep in video editing.\n\n3. Connectivity\n\nUSB Type-C with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility and a MicroSD card reader will help creatives to transfer files quickly and efficiently. I loved how quickly I was able to move files onto the machine, no matter whether I was dealing with MB or GB. This is a machine that can handle large files with ease.\n\nFeature score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nBenchmark scores\n\nWe test every one of our laptops using the same benchmarking software suite to give you a thorough overview of its suitability for creatives of all disciplines and levels. This includes:\n\n• Geekbench: Tests the CPU for single-core and multi-core power, and the GPU for the system's potential for gaming, image processing, or video editing. Geekbench AI tests the CPU and GPU on a variety of AI-powered and AI-boosted tasks.\n\n• Cinebench: Tests the CPU and GPU's ability to run Cinema 4D and Redshift.\n\n• UL Procyon: Uses UL Solutions' Procyon software suite to test the system's ability for AI image generation in Stable Diffusion, its Microsoft Office performance and its battery life in a looping video test.\n\n• Topaz Video AI: We use Topaz Video AI to test the system's ability to upscale video and convert video to slow-motion.\n\n• PugetBench for Creators: We use the PugetBench for Creators benchmarking suite to test the system's ability to run several key tasks in Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro, as well as its performance when encoding/transcoding video.\n\n• ON1 Resize AI: Tests the system's ability to resize 5 photos to 200% in a batch process. We take the total time taken to resize the images and divide by 5.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Header Cell - Column 1 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ GEEKBENCH 6 CPU Single-core: Row 0 - Cell 2 Row 1 - Cell 0 CPU Multi-core: Row 1 - Cell 2 Row 2 - Cell 0 GPU OpenCL: Row 2 - Cell 2 CINEBENCH 2024 CPU single-core: Row 3 - Cell 2 Row 4 - Cell 0 CPU multi-core: Row 4 - Cell 2 Row 5 - Cell 0 GPU: Row 5 - Cell 2 UL PROCYON AI Image Generation (Stable Diffusion 1.5) Row 6 - Cell 2 Row 7 - Cell 0 Office Productivity Benchmark: Row 7 - Cell 2 Row 8 - Cell 0 Battery Life Benchmark: Row 8 - Cell 2 TOPAZ VIDEO AI Enhancement: Row 9 - Cell 2 Row 10 - Cell 0 Slowmo: Row 10 - Cell 2 Row 11 - Cell 0 Combined: Row 11 - Cell 2 ON1 RESIZE 200% resize time: Row 12 - Cell 2 PUGETBENCH for PHOTOSHOP Overall: Row 13 - Cell 2 Row 14 - Cell 0 General: Row 14 - Cell 2 Row 15 - Cell 0 Filter: Row 15 - Cell 2 PUGETBENCH for DAVINCI RESOLVE Overall: Row 16 - Cell 2 Row 17 - Cell 0 GPU Effects: Row 17 - Cell 2 Row 18 - Cell 0 Fusion score: Row 18 - Cell 2 Row 19 - Cell 0 AI score: Row 19 - Cell 2 Row 20 - Cell 0 H.264 encoding: Row 20 - Cell 2\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nPerformance\n\n• Strong performance when using Adobe Photoshop\n\n• The lack of a discrete GPU means creative professionals will struggle\n\nOne of the current issues that I have with AI laptops is that they promise so much and pitch themselves as the solution to all problems. The advertising makes them sound like their AI technology will provide you with instant results, no matter the application and workflow. Maybe I'm overstating it, but it certainly feels like that to me.\n\nThat's why I was left pleasantly surprised by the Prestige A16 AI+. The lack of a discrete GPU was problematic for 3D rendering and colour grading, but the CPU and integrated GPU actually did a great job in Photoshop and Premiere Pro. The fact that it was able to handle complex video compositions and layered effects was not what I expected.\n\nAlongside photo and video editing, I also spent a lot of time browsing the web, watching videos, and carrying out general-purpose office work. The laptop served up a responsive and snappy experience in this area, which further contributed to the laptop's impressive performance.\n\nI was also impressed by the laptop's ability to perform across a broad range of applications. I think this was in part thanks to the MSI AI Engine that was adjusting hardware settings behind the scenes. It really does excel in this role, as demonstrated by its Geekbench scores. With a reasonable multi-core score, this laptop is good at multi-threading, but not to the degree of something like the ASUS ProArt P16 (2025).\n\nThe laptop's battery life, however, proved to be a significant limitation, lasting a relatively short eight hours. That means you'll either need to consign it to a permanent desk setup or be happy carrying the charger around with you. I thought I could overcome this by utilising a lightweight third-party charger, but the apparent lack of wattage meant that the system slowed to a total standstill. By way of comparison, you'll get similar battery performance on the ASUS V16 and Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.\n\nWith all this considered, the Prestige A16 AI+ is a high-performing laptop for most types of creative applications. Keep in mind, though, that if you need a laptop for more demanding graphics applications, you'll want a device with a discrete GPU.\n\nPerformance score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nPrice\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is a mid-range to high-end laptop that costs $1,399/£1,499, although there are often limited-time deals around that bring the price down considerably. If you'd prefer an OLED display with a higher resolution (UHD+ 3840x2400) then a model with that spec is also available.\n\nIn terms of comparison, you might also like the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i Gen 9, although it'll set you back at least £1,635. If you'd like something a bit more middle of the road, then the Dell XPS 16 is a great alternative, especially if you're keen on customising your own machine.\n\nValue score: 4/5\n\nWho is it for?\n\n• Content creators who don't need a discrete GPU\n\nHopefully it goes without saying, but if you're into 3D modelling, animation, rendering, high-resolution video editing, and colour grading, then you'll need a laptop with a discrete GPU. If you're creating other types of content, performing low-demand creative tasks, or needing a laptop that can boost your productivity, then the MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is well worth a look.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally MSI Prestige A16 AI+ score card Attributes Notes Rating Design: A modern aesthetic with a bright IPS display. Also perfect for portability. 4/5 Features: AI-powered performance takes centre stage, and at times it delivers, but not always. 4/5 Performance: Great for most creative projects, but the lack of a discrete GPU will be a problem for some. 4/5 Value: A relatively affordable laptop, but keep in mind it doesn't have a discrete GPU. 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou value AI-accelerated performance\n\nYou want a bright and accurate display\n\nYou need excellent portability\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou need a discrete GPU\n\nYou're only going to be web browsing"

      "content": "OBS Studio 32.0 has been released. The update sees this streaming and screen recording stable gain a nifty new plugin manager, change a few of its default settings and expand its support for NVIDIA RTX effects.\n\nThe new plugin manager is described as “basic” because it is: it shows a list of installed plugins with a checkbox to enable/disable, but ‘Browse’ and ‘Update’ options are greyed out (those options being there suggests it will be possible to find and install plugins in OBS directly).\n\nOBS Studio 3.20 increases the default bitrate from 2500 to 6000 Kbps.\n\nThe old value was decided upon a decade ago, and expectations in quality have shifted. OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.\n\nUsers with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.\n\nHybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.\n\nOn Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.\n\nOther notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:\n\nOpt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)\n\nExperimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs\n\nAudio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc\n\n--disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed\n\nPlugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded\n\nBeyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.\n\nThough a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.\n\nHow to Install OBS Studio 32.0\n\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).\n\nOn Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.\n\nThere’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).\n\nTo install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\n\nThen, install OBS Studio using apt :\n\nsudo apt install obs-studio\n\nFinally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team."

      "content": "Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.\n\nThis announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.\n\nWhile an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.\n\nStill, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.\n\nNevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.\n\nEven though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "headline": "No, Xbox's next gen console hardware plans aren't cancelled — for now, but it's a problem that it was really easy to believe",
      "content": "So today, rumors began to swirl across the internet that Xbox is planning to exit hardware, and move entirely to Xbox Cloud Gaming as the primary way to access content. I can confirm via very trusted sources that this isn't true. At least for now.\n\nBut that, \"at least for now\" qualifier is a real problem. How can we know what will be true next quarter? Let's put aside for a minute the fact that Xbox Game Pass remains a primary driver of revenue, and is most prolific on Xbox console hardware — and that's where the bulk of the users are right now. Let's put aside the fact that Xbox Cloud Gaming is restricted by location and is expensive to run.\n\nCombine that with the fact that with the same silicon, you could give people their own \"cloud\" natively in their house — and get them to use their own electricity to power it. You know, like a console. It doesn't make a lot of sense on paper. But regardless, that's where we're at.\n\nUPDATE: Microsoft has at least confirmed that, for now, that the rumors are false, as noted in the statement above. But how did we get here? The original report continues below.\n\nAll of these rumors emerged in the wake of Microsoft's barely-explicable 50% price rise in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and the weird tone-deaf way in which they tried to present it as a \"good thing\" throwing in Fortnite Crew and stuff people didn't really ask for.\n\nThe fact these latest hardware exit rumors continue to seem plausible is a real problem, despite the source of the rumors. It showcases, to me, a very deep disconnect between Microsoft and how its audience and the community at large views gaming in general.\n\nMicrosoft's multi-year partnership with AMD for next-gen Xbox hardware is still the present plan\n\nXbox + AMD: Powering the Next Generation of Xbox - YouTube Watch On\n\nI could easily be just as random a source claiming that Xbox hardware is still on the table, but it was our sources that confirmed the existence of the Xbox Series X|S, their specs, their price, in addition to reports on the cancelled cloud \"Keystone\" console, the shelved first-party Xbox handheld, and more recently, the Xbox Ally. Codenamed Kennan and comprised of Omni (Xbox Ally) and Horseman (Xbox Ally X), the Xbox Ally range is part of Microsoft's multi-year partnership with AMD, which will include tailor-made devices from first party.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nI've asked multiple trusted sources, many of whom spoke to me on the above devices previously which turned out to be true, about what Xbox's present hardware posture is. And with Microsoft's confirmation, there's no reason to think anything is changing.\n\nMicrosoft publicly confirmed that it's still committed to first-party Xbox hardware over the summer, with comments from both President Sarah Bond and AMD CEO Lisa Su on silicon that would power next-gen Xbox devices — both from third and first-party. The statement reiterates this commitment.\n\nThe original comments came from a gaming forum, and suggested that Xbox's focus would be on its core mega franchises like World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Forza Horizon, and so on, and that hardware plans were \"up in the air,\" not actually cancelled. Those comments morphed into \"Xbox hardware is cancelled\" from various commentators, and have now taken on a life of their own on social media as people speculate on the future of the Xbox platform. From what I've been told, the hardware plans are not even \"up in the air,\" and remain firmly Xbox's path forward. Xbox Series X|S hardware production has not ceased, and new stock will go out to retailers at its usual cadence.\n\nAMD & Xbox | Advancing the Future of Gaming - YouTube Watch On\n\nBut even if Microsoft did come out to squash the rumors themselves, it's hard to have any faith. Microsoft has been incredibly fickle over the past few years, crushed under AI hype, demands from CFO Amy Hood, and a complete dereliction of fan feedback.\n\nThe planned restructuring of Xbox Game Pass was months in the making and, beyond their apparent macroeconomic \"need\" to make even more money, it's based on user behavior and the desire to boost the content fund for the cohort most likely to unsubscribe without new content. Codenames appearing for the new tiers over the summer, and is not the result of a quarterly knee-jerk reaction. But it doesn't matter.\n\nCombined with huge price hikes, retailers like Costco and others removing Xbox hardware, and Microsoft's massive layoffs over the summer — it's not unsurprising people are speculating on Xbox's demise. Microsoft is absolutely awful at managing faith in its consumer products, and I've written previously about how the telemetry driving its decisions and its diffuse focus is leading to a collapse in morale in the brand.\n\nGaming is not a necessity, or a utility — it's driven by sentiment and \"fun\" feeling. people need to also feel good about where they play, and Microsoft is making it incredibly hard to feel good about Xbox right now. It's clearly reaching a crisis point.\n\nXbox the pariah\n\nThis feels like 2013 again. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nI've been covering Xbox for over ten years at this point, and I started when Microsoft's bombed Xbox One reveal led to a groundswell of hate for the brand and its future. It was fostered by a sense of betrayal in what Xbox had been and represented, and led to a huge climb down that effectively dismantled the Xbox One platform — and put Xbox firmly in \"third-place\" forever. Lately, it feels like we're back in 2013 again.\n\nThe industry looks very different in 2025, as maturing audiences and a lack of meaningful new player growth has companies breaking the rules to find new revenue streams. We've seen Xbox games flood onto PlayStation, we've even seen PlayStation bring games to Xbox. Microsoft is licensing out the Xbox brand to OEMs with the Xbox Ally (and I'm told more OEM hardware should appear in 2026, too).\n\nThe inconsistency is exhausting for fans, and in a sentiment-driven business, potentially untenable.\n\nThe one constant that Xbox fans could point to among all of this was the clear value of Xbox Game Pass. \"Xbox Game Pass is the best value in gaming,\" or so the meme goes. Despite some price rises over the past couple of years, it was hard to overlook what a stellar year it had thus far, with games like Expedition 33, Blue Prince, DOOM, The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion remake, and others. But with an unprecedented 50% price increase on the tier that actually gets day one games, the negative reaction has been incredibly strong.\n\nIt all just feels like another betrayal, particularly given President Sarah Bond's comments that Xbox Game Pass is profitable, and also hitting $5 billion in revenues. The way Xbox presented the \"changes\" as a \"good thing\" came across as tone deaf, especially given how other companies are pushing up prices while also simultaneously reporting record profits.\n\nSo, it's hardly surprising that these rumors gained so much traction, because even if they're not true today, they could definitely be true tomorrow. It's hard to take anything what today's Xbox says or does on faith, because they're apparently willing to throw anything and everything on the fire if it means a quarterly boost.\n\nThe inconsistency is exhausting for fans, most likely concerning for developers — and in a sentiment-driven business, potentially untenable.",

      "headline": "Working on the HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a good experience, but I think it can be hard to justify the cost of this Ryzen AI business laptop",
      "content": "The HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a showcase for HP’s engineering skills, as it packs a lot into a relatively small chassis without compromising performance or battery life. I just wish it were a little cheaper, so more people could afford a PC with this underlying power.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: 30-second review\n\nTo avoid immediate confusion, HP makes a standard version of the EliteBook 8 G1a 14 laptop, and then the Next Gen AI PC Wolf Pro Security Edition (A27BLEA) that this review covers.\n\nWhile these share many of the same hardware components, the Next Gen AI PC Wolf Pro Security Edition (A27BLEA) is specifically designed for business users who need to deploy laptops for power users with enhanced security requirements.\n\nBuilt around the new AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350, this is a highly efficient and yet powerful machine that’s ideal for demanding tasks, like running local AI models.\n\nBut it’s also ideal for a user who runs demanding AI tools, even if this machine wouldn’t realistically cross the threshold into being classed as a mobile workstation.\n\nIf you are looking for that level of performance, a laptop that uses the Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375 is probably more appropriate.\n\nThe limitations of the EliteBook 8 G1a are that it doesn’t have a second full M.2 2280 slot, limiting the amount of storage to 3TB with current capacities. And, while the memory modules are upgradable, this system with only one module is starved of memory bandwidth.\n\nIt does come with Wi-Fi 7, HDMI output and Thunderbolt ports, so while it might not be a necessity to have a docking station, it can exploit one effectively.\n\nAre you a pro?

With so many machines of this type appearing, it’s hard to pick this one as being exceptional enough to be one of the best business laptops. But HP makes highly effective hardware, and the EliteBook 8 G1a doesn’t undermine that narrative.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Price and availability\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nHow much does it cost? From $1550/£1515\n\nFrom $1550/£1515 When is it out? Available now\n\nAvailable now Where can you get it? Direct from HP, or via online retailers\n\nSold as the HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC Wolf Pro Security Edition, the asking price in the UK is £1799.99 for a machine with 64GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage.\n\nThe same spec in the USA is priced at $1,899, making it currently a better deal for American buyers.\n\nWhat’s slightly odd is that via the HP store, it isn’t possible to select the spec of the review hardware, which matches 64GB of RAM with 512GB of storage.\n\nChoosing 512GB of storage automatically drops the memory to 32GB.\n\nFor American customers, the cheapest model with the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor is $1549. European buyers can’t get that combination, and the lowest-priced option in the UK is £1,511.99, with 1TB of storage and 32GB of RAM for that money.\n\nIt should be noted that for those buying into the AI era, local AI models need lots of RAM to run quickly, so it might be pointless to run this CPU with only 16GB of RAM.\n\nThe RAM on these systems can be upgraded, as can the storage, but that’s additional cost and effort beyond the purchase price.\n\nWhile I’m sure other brands will be using a similar platform in the coming months, at this time, the only significant releases are from Asus with the Zenbook S16, and the Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 6 and P16s Gen 4.\n\nThe Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 6 typically retails for around $ 1,240, featuring 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Whereas the P16s Gen 4 is $1500 for one with 64GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.\n\nSo far, Asus isn’t using the PRO variant of the 350, but they do have the even more powerful Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 in the Zenbook S16 series, and you can get one with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for only $1400.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the HP asking price for this machine isn’t excessive, but those looking for better value might want to consider the Asus Zenbook S16 series, which could easily save you money and get you a more powerful platform.\n\nWhat’s always important to realise is that retail costs as presented on the brand websites aren’t what corporations pay for bulk orders, and that sort of horse trading could make HP a much more competitive option.\n\nValue: 3.5 / 5\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Specs\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Category Item Processor AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 PRO 2.0GHz (16MB Cache, up to 5.0 GHz, 8 cores, 16 Threads) NPU Performance 50 TOPS (Neural Processing Unit for local AI tasks) Total TOPS 66 TOPS (NPU and CPU combined) Memory 64 GB DDR5-5600 (maximum official capacity) Storage 1 TB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD Storage Exp.

Its sleek, minimalist exterior is crafted from high-quality materials, giving it a premium feel and durability. The notebook’s slim profile and lightweight construction make it highly portable, ideal for those who travel for a living.\n\nThe 14-inch display is a standout feature, offering vibrant colours and sharp resolution that make working on the laptop relatively easy. The narrow bezels maximise screen real estate, providing an immersive viewing experience without increasing the overall size and weight of the device. The anti-glare coating ensures that the screen remains readable in various lighting conditions, reducing eye strain during extended use.\n\nWhat I was less enamoured with was the keyboard. The positive aspects are that the keys are well-spaced and provide a satisfying tactile response, making typing a pleasure.\n\nBut the keyboard doesn’t use the full width of the machine, and therefore some keys ended up reduced in size. Not a fan of tiny function keys or the cursor cluster, but despite this, I can type at a reasonable speed on it.\n\nThe backlit feature allows for easy use in low-light environments, adding to the notebook’s versatility. The touchpad is generously sized and highly responsive, supporting multi-touch gestures for improved navigation.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nA real strength of the HP EliteBook 8 G1a is the port selection, since it includes USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, and an audio jack. This selection ensures compatibility with a wide array of peripherals and accessories, enhancing the notebook’s functionality. The inclusion of Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, using the MediaTek MT7925 (2x2), ensures fast and reliable wireless connectivity.\n\nBeing a Wolf Pro Security Edition, HP add some neat features to provide robust protection against malware and cyber threats, in theory. These include a fingerprint reader and facial recognition technology built to secure logins and safeguard sensitive data. The part of the Wolf Pro technology that IT professionals will gravitate to is the Cloud-Based Management Console, which enables a centralised control for IT teams to monitor and respond to threats. There are lots of other features, like AI and behavioural analysis to detect unknown threats, if you haven’t already deployed equivalent tools in the business environment.\n\nOverall, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a well-designed, high-performance notebook that meets the needs of modern professionals and power users, without resorting to discrete GPUs and limited battery life.\n\nDesign: 4 / 5\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Hardware\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 300 series CPU\n\nRadeon 860M GPU\n\nUpgrades\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 350 PRO is one of the new Krackan Point CPUs that have recently come to market, and utilises the AMD mobile chipset FP8, aka Strix Point.\n\nBuilt on the latest 4nm TSMC fabrication, for its size and power consumption, this CPU delivers some exceptional performance, especially for AI use.\n\nFor those who read my Asus Expertbook P3 review, a machine that uses the non-PRO version of this chip, you might be wondering what a PRO spec processor adds.\n\nThe main distinction lies in the fact that the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 is tailored for business use, featuring additional functionalities and capabilities specifically designed for enterprise needs that are not present in the consumer variant, the Ryzen AI 7 350. Although both processors utilise the same core architecture and have similar performance potential, the “PRO” label indicates improvements in security, manageability, and reliability explicitly designed for business environments.\n\nWhat that’s worth to you personally, I can’t say, but HP does make a toned-down model with the basic AMD Ryzen 7 350 if you want to save a small amount of money.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nWhat isn’t radical on this platform is the Radeon 860M GPU, which I’d characterise as being a reasonable integrated GPU, but nothing special.\n\nThis balance of a high-end CPU and mid-range GPU hints that it’s built for those power users who aren’t editing 4K videos or modelling in 3D. But what it does well is support local AI challenges for those who need AI functionality, but can’t guarantee cloud services.\n\nThe evolution of AI for business use is still very much at the Proterozoic stage, but for those who are embracing technologies like CoPilot, this hardware is superior to the prior generation.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nWhile not perfect, the upgrade paths in this machine do at least allow for enhanced memory and storage, and potentially the WiFi module when WiFi 8 becomes available.\n\nGetting inside is relatively easy with a small screwdriver and a spudger, and with the underside removed, the battery, memory and storage are all highly accessible.\n\nUnlike the HX 395 hardware, which uses soldered memory, this platform features two SODIMM slots that can accommodate up to 32GB modules, for a maximum capacity of 64GB. It might be that at some point you will be able to get 48GB or 64GB modules, and increase that to 96GB or even 128GB, since the Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 can address up to 256GB of memory space.\n\nI had two disappointments with the insides, and both related to the storage. The first is that the M.2 2280 slot, pre-installed with a Gen 4 1TB NVMe in my review hardware, didn’t have any form of heatsink or pad to help it dissipate. That effectively limits it to 2TB drives, since 4TB and 8TB options either come with or expect help with cooling.\n\nThe second M.2 slot is only 2230-sized, limiting it to 1TB capacities currently. There isn’t much room, I accept, but a second 2280 slot would have been terrific, since using AI without lots of storage space isn’t ideal.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nHardware: 4 / 5\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Performance\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Laptops Header Cell - Column 1 HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 AI Asus Expertbook P3 (with dual memory) CPU Row 0 - Cell 1 AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 Cores/Threads Row 1 - Cell 1 8C 16T 8C 16T TPD Row 2 - Cell 1 15-54W (28W) 15-54W (28W) RAM Row 3 - Cell 1 64GB DDR5-5600 (2x32GB) 32GB DDR5-5600 (2x16GB) SSD Row 4 - Cell 1 500GB WD Blue SN5000 1TB Micron 2500 MTFDKBA1T0QGN Graphics Row 5 - Cell 1 AMD Radeon 860M AMD Radeon 860M NPU Row 6 - Cell 1 AMD Ryzen AI (50 TOPS) AMD Ryzen AI (50 TOPS) 3DMark WildLife 16,844 15,582 Row 8 - Cell 0 FireStrike 6331 6107 Row 9 - Cell 0 TimeSpy 2975 2882 Row 10 - Cell 0 Steel Nomad.L 2364 2262 CineBench24 Single 114 116 Row 12 - Cell 0 Multi 856 909 Row 13 - Cell 0 Ratio 7.48 7.83 GeekBench 6 Single 2857 2886 Row 15 - Cell 0 Multi 13638 13560 Row 16 - Cell 0 OpenCL 24764 24370 Row 17 - Cell 0 Vulkan 34322 33104 CrystalDIsk Read MB/s 7159 7006 Row 19 - Cell 0 Write MB/s 6558 6111 PCMark 10 Office 7576 7763 Row 21 - Cell 0 Battery 14h 31m 18h 17m Battery Whr 62 70 WEI Score 8.2 8.1\n\nSince they use the same platform and memory technology, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a is worthy of comparison with the Asus Expertbook P3, admittedly a cheaper device.\n\nHow HP configured this machine enables it to outperform the P3 in many tests, and it was provided with a better storage device in the bargain.\n\nWhere the P3 overtakes it is in battery life, with the Asus machine having a larger battery and a longer operating time accordingly.\n\nHowever, both these machines run for longer than a typical working day, and the EliteBook 8 G1a is lighter for those who carry their system with them.\n\nOne important note is that the performance of both these laptops can be massively undermined by using only a single memory module, as the review P3 was delivered. Therefore, don’t order one with a single memory module, or if you do, then purchase another identical module to get all the memory bandwidth available.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nPerformance: 4 / 5\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Final verdict\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a ticks plenty of corporate boxes, something HP is exceptionally skilled at doing.\n\nWhat it offers is a powerful yet battery-efficient solution with all the latest security enhancements and management tools that corporate IT will love. It also features sufficient ports that most users won’t need a docking station, and the underlying platform is capable of running local AI models and tools.\n\nIt isn’t the cheapest laptop running this AMD Ryzen AI platform, but the quality of construction and features like Thunderbolt ports go some way to justify the extra it can cost over more affordable options.\n\nNot the best 14-inch laptop I’ve seen, but a solid platform that delivers power-user appeal without sacrificing its practicality.\n\nShould you buy a HP EliteBook 8 G1a?\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Value You pay a HP premium, but the build quality is good 3.5 / 5 Design A power-packed design that feels substantial 4 / 5 Hardware AI 300 series CPU, DDR5 and special AI sauce is a winning combo 4 / 5 Performance Excellent performer and acceptable battery life 4 / 5 Overall A powerful AI platform for those who need that 4 / 5\n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou need Thunderbolt or USB4\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 at the heart of this design has Thunderbolt/USB4 ports inherently, but there are laptops around that don’t implement them for various reasons. If you want that technology, and most would, then this machine is for you.\n\nYou like upgrades\n\nLots of bits on this machine can easily be upgraded, including the memory and storage. If you don’t mind using a screwdriver, then there is plenty of potential for enhancements.\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou need exceptional battery life\n\nAccording to HP, this machine should last more than 18 hours, but it only lasted 14 hours in my test. That’s respectable, but other machines that use the latest Intel Ultra 200 processors or the Qualcomm Snapdragon X series can last longer.\n\nYou are on a tight budget\n\nFor the money, this is a decent laptop with plenty of nice features and a good hardware platform, but it’s hardly cheap. There are cheaper options that sacrifice some of the bells and whistles that use the same CPU, which will make your budget stretch further.\n\nFor more productivity machines, we reviewed the best laptops for work and gaming and the best laptops for working from home.",

      "headline": "Lenovo Legion Go 2 Review: A Handheld Made For Big, Meaty Claws",
      "content": "You buy Lenovo’s new Legion Go 2 handheld for the screen. The performance is secondary to how beautiful recent 2D titles look on the 8.8-inch, 1200p OLED display. The Legion Go 2 is otherwise a big, meaty handheld for gamers with big, meaty claws. You’ll struggle to hold it above your head lying in bed unless you’re a professional power lifter; the controls won’t be your favorite; it’s as wonky as its predecessor. And it’s hard to argue anybody should spend well over $1,000 on a gaming handheld rather than just buying a full gaming laptop.\n\nDespite all that, I can’t help but enjoy the hell out of it. My initial hours spent rolling my eyes at everything Lenovo failed to fix from its first iteration slowly morphed into the kind of appreciation that can only occur when a device starts to feel personal. It’s what happened when I downloaded Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades II to the device and had to hold back a gasp on a crowded plane for how gorgeous both games looked on Lenovo’s big, expensive, beautiful display.\n\nLegion Go 2 It's thick, heavy, and so damn pretty. It's a shame it costs as much as it does. 4 See at Best Buy Pros Beautiful OLED display\n\n144Hz refresh rate with VRR\n\nNew ergonomics\n\nLow-wattage performance uplift Cons Annoying removable controls\n\nFPS mode is pointless\n\nReflective display\n\nVery expensive at $1,350\n\nIt’s the same feeling I get from Valve’s $550 Steam Deck OLED, which uses the same organic light-emitting diode screen technology to present deeper contrast and rich colors. Valve’s handheld maxes out at 800p on an older, custom AMD chipset. Even when you factor in performance and display size, the Steam Deck OLED is still a much, much better deal. My review unit version of the Legion Go 2 with the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, costs $1,350. I could literally buy two Steam Decks for this price (more if I opted for the LCD model). For Lenovo’s inflated price, I could run out and buy three $450 Nintendo Switch 2 handhelds. You could nab a version of the Legion Go 2 that starts at $1,100 for a version with a AMD Ryzen Z2, but judging by my tests that chip will land closer in power to handhelds that are three years old and cost much less.\n\nIt’s a ridiculous scenario that consumers are taking the brunt of Donald Trump’s obsession with import taxes, aka tariffs. And in that way, consumers are screwed no matter what. The upcoming Asus ROG Xbox Ally X, which is set to launch on Oct. 16 with the same Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, will set you back $1,000. The original Legion Go asked for $700 in 2023. The Asus ROG Ally X demanded $800 at launch last year. Both now retail at a higher price, likely due to tariffs. I would tell you to wait and buy a new handheld, but there’s no way to tell if prices might increase in coming months.\n\nReally? You kept FPS mode?\n\nWhat drives me mad using the Legion Go 2 is how Lenovo held back from improving over the 2023 handheld. The revised version is far more ergonomic than the two-year-old device with its sharp corners. Both handhelds let you remove each controller and play with the screen separated, like the Nintendo Switch. The Switch 2 did away with rails and went for magnetic connections for each Joy-Con 2, which makes attaching and detaching the controllers a little easier. Lenovo’s old and new system still use a series of exposed pins you jam into a cavity on each side of the screen. You need two hands and a strong pitching arm to remove each controller with a down and out motion. Reattaching them can be just as annoying.\n\nSee Lenovo Legion Go 2 at Best Buy\n\nThe controller uses Hall effect sticks that are much better at surviving stick drift, though they still feel a little too thin on my fingers compared to other handhelds I’ve used. The Legion Go 2 has slightly redesigned bumper buttons that make it easier to press and the same, large triggers. The $650 Legion Go S had a switch to enable instant triggers with less travel—better for first-person shooter games, but because of the removable controllers you’ll have to stick with the full range of motion.\n\nThe Switch 2’s big standout feature is its new mouse mode enabled just by putting the controller down on a table or your pant’s leg. Lenovo did it first on the Legion Go with its FPS mode. So is it any better now? No, absolutely not. You still need to remove the right controller and flick the “FPS” switch to turn on an optical mouse sensor. You then need to slot it into a base to hold it like an old-school flight stick, where the two side buttons act as the left and right mouse click. The DPI is still low enough you’ll struggle to get it working on anything but a desk. Even when you do, using a joystick and the FPS controller together necessitates changing the in-game controls. I tried it in both Cyberpunk 2077 and Borderlands 4, and it caused such havoc with both titles I was loathe to use the FPS mode again.\n\nAs for I/O, the Legion Go 2 has both a bottom and top USB-4 port. In theory, this could allow you to hook it up to an eGPU. More likely, it’s sole purpose is for charging or hooking up to a dock for HDMI passthrough. As much as Lenovo implies you’ll create a full “battle station” out of your device for instantaneous PC, you don’t want to hook it up to anything larger than a 1440p monitor, and only then for playing games most systems can run anyway.\n\nStrangely enough, one of the best improvements over the last generation handheld is the Legion Go 2’s new soft carrying case. The old case was very protective, but it was also enormous. The new version is smaller and more squat than the default Steam Deck case, which makes lugging around the 8.8-inch handheld onto planes surprisingly easy. There’s two little hidey-holes for the FPS mode stand, but since you’ll never use it, you can stick anything else in there. Just don’t tell me what.\n\nThe Legion Go 2 is so damn pretty\n\nAll the new ergonomics make it easier to hold, but not enough that it won’t feel heavy in your hands. You’ll find you’ll need a table or lap to rest your elbows on, or else you’ll use the built-in kickstand to prop it up on your desk. Either way you hold it, you’ll end up enjoying this handheld mostly for the display. As I said earlier, the 8.8-inch OLED display is sublime. It doesn’t have any higher screen resolution than the Legion Go’s 1,920 x 1,200, but it’s enough to make games pop.\n\nFor my hands, the Legion Go 2 is just large enough where I can grip it and access all the controls. Other users who are smaller in stature may not be so lucky. Ignore all those 11-inch handhelds out there. Near-9-inch devices are more than enough. The screen also sports a 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, or variable refresh rate. All those games that can hit above 100 fps (which, let’s be honest, will mostly be older or 2D titles), will look their peak on the Legion Go 2.\n\nThe screen feels bright enough indoors, but while Lenovo promises you’ll get 1,100 nits of HDR brightness, the screen is not great for using outdoors. It’s blinded by direct sunlight, and even sitting near a window you’ll see most details disappear. The screen is also very reflective. A matte coating would have dulled the display quality, but it’s at the risk of catching a glimpse of your girlfriend walking up behind you.\n\nRyzen Z2 Extreme isn’t a huge leap\n\nThe AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU is purely iterative. If you’ve been watching like a hawk, hoping to devour the latest and fastest handheld chip, this isn’t it. The performance difference generation to generation is minimal. In some games, you could get 5 to 10 fps more at the highest TDP, or thermal design power, People who focus too hard on benchmarks will come away disappointed. If you care more about whether the system can play the latest AAA games, know that you’ll be able to achieve playable frame rates at the max 1200p resolution though only by dropping any hope of ray tracing for more-realistic lighting effects.\n\nSee Lenovo Legion Go 2 at Best Buy\n\nI’m fundamentally a gamer who refuses to drop the resolution of games for the sake of performance. I will lower graphics settings in a desperate attempt to eek out the minimum 30 fps. The Legion Go 2 can manage to take some AAA games into playable states at the max 35W of TDP (thermal design power) once the handheld’s engines are firing on all cylinders. TDP determines how much power is being sent to the processor, which will dictate overall performance. Borderlands 4 is one of those games notorious for running poorly on PC and consoles alike (you won’t find the game on Switch 2 in the coming days, either). I was able to get a stable sub-40 fps on the lowest possible graphics settings. I could achieve a little better frame rates in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Even at lower graphics settings, the game still looks and sounds great on the small screen.\n\nOlder games fare better. Control could average 40 to 49 fps at low settings with the handheld plugged in. The Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark at 1200p and medium settings preset with AMD’s FSR upscaling saw an average of 44 fps, while at 1080p with the same settings it could hit 48 fps. In Baldur’s Gate III, I could average above 60 fps in the open areas of Act 1 and get between 45 and 55 fps in the city environments of Act III.\n\nIn 3DMark benchmarks, the Legion Go 2 hit a score of 3,305 and 24.48 average fps in Steel Nomad Lite tests. That’s 1,000 points better than the Legion Go S with its Ryzen Z2 Go chip running on Windows, but it’s only a little more than 300 points better than the Z1 Extreme on the Asus ROG Ally X from 2024. The new device hit 3,897 points in Time Spy tests, which again is barely more than 300 points better than an Ally X. It’s not much better than an MSI Claw 8 AI+, which uses a full Intel laptop chip. Simply put, the Legion Go 2 isn’t a huge step over the previous gen at the max wattage.\n\nHowever, the device’s secret sauce is in how well it performs at lower wattages. Tests with multiple games at wattages as low as 34 fps still enabled relatively stable frame rates in games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider. While in Cyberpunk 2077 at full resolution and Steam Deck settings, the device gets 44 fps in benchmarks, at 15W it still managed to eek out nearly 30 fps. I don’t expect anybody will run high-end games on lower power. Instead, the best experience comes from games that are far less intensive. I could net well over 160 fps in Hades II on the “Balanced” performance setting. Hollow Knight: Silksong seems like it was built with the Legion Go 2 in mind with automatic settings to stay around 144Hz. These games play so gloriously on this handheld, I don’t want to play them on anything else. It’s a shame you have to spend $350 more than an Xbox Ally X jut for that pretty screen and higher refresh rate.\n\nWindows still sucks for handhelds, but it could get better\n\nOn balanced power settings, I could game for around 2 hours and 40 minutes before the device was literally begging me to plug it in. In other tests where I was gaming at the full resolution and wattage playing Indiana Jones, it lasted closer to 2 hours. The Legion Go 2 sports a 74Wh battery, which is slightly worse than the ROG Ally X’s 80Wh. The larger OLED display and higher max resolution will inevitably drag the battery life down.\n\nAt this point, players should not expect a handheld that will last very long. The ROG Ally X still has one of the best battery life at full power when it gets closer to 3 hours of runtime. In real life, the difference is negligible. At this point in my life, having a max two hours of playtime is strangely beneficial. If I’m clearing room after room in Hades II late at night, the battery timer is essentially my alarm. If it’s close to 12 a.m. and I’m about to run out of power, it’s a sign I should get some rest.\n\nDepending on the game you’re playing, the device’s fans can get relatively loud. Even at max speed I wouldn’t call them jet engine noise. It’s enough to remind you to be mindful when sitting next to strangers on a plane. The device kept very cool in my time using it. I never felt any heat around the controls, and the area around the fans also didn’t feel steamy when playing a game at max wattage.\n\nI can’t excuse the price, but I had such a good time with the Legion Go 2 it felt like a personal companion after traveling for more than a week and a half away from home. But there’s an elephant in the room shaped like a big “X” we need to address. The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are supposed to launch with a new version of Windows, dubbed the “Full Screen Experience” (FSE) built exclusively for gaming handhelds. While this may fix the lingering usability issues of Windows 11 on a 7- or 8-inch screen, the upgrade should also eliminate background tasks and—hopefully—boost performance by 20%. The issue is that Microsoft has said you may need to wait until next spring to get it on handhelds like the Legion Go 2.\n\nWindows is terrible on handhelds. It gets in the way when trying to put the device to sleep while still in-game. It bombards you with popups for OneDrive that you need to use the touchscreen to excise. It saps power and makes the device run worse than it would if it was running SteamOS, the same Linux-based operating system running on the Steam Deck. In our tests, the Legion Go S with SteamOS outperforms its Windows counterpart by 20 to 30%. Unless you’re dead set on keeping your Xbox Game Pass games handy, I would suggest looking into installing Valve’s software on the Legion Go 2. I have not confirmed whether you can install SteamOS on the new handheld, though if its not compatible at launch, I assume an update may be around the corner. Without the FSE or SteamOS, this can’t be my handheld of choice. With a new operating system, the Legion Go 2 would become the bell of the ball for modern PC handhelds.\n\nSee Lenovo Legion Go 2 at Best Buy",

      "content": "The Direct Rendering Manager \"DRM\" pull request ended up leading to Linus Torvalds complaining over text and Rust code formatting but in the end he pulled all of these kernel graphics driver updates and also the associated \"accel\" accelerator subsystem drivers too.With the Linux 6.18 DRM pull there is a lot of kernel graphics driver improvements across the board, including the new drivers of Tyr and the Rocket accelerator driver. For enhancing existing driver support, the AMD and Intel graphics drivers continue seeing a bulk of the activity. Plus ongoing Rust code work in the DRM subsystem and more.\n\nBelow is a look at the DRM kernel driver changes for Linux 6.18.- The \"Rocket\" accelerator driver is finally mainlined for enabling the NPU found on newer Rockchip SoCs. This is the open-source driver reverse-engineered and started by Tomeu Vizoso. The Rocket accel driver works with new user-space code in Mesa 25.3 for Rockchip NPUs.- The AMDGPU and AMDKFD Checkpoint and Resture \"CRIU\" support for GEM memory objects.- Expanded AMDGPU Video Core Next \"VCN\" engine reset support.- More AMD Cyan Skillfish updates.- The AMDXDNA accelerator driver now supports user-space allocated buffers, improved error reporting, and other enhancements.- A new Intel Xe driver interface for querying VMA count and memory attributes. The intel Intel SLPC \"power_profile\" sysfs interface for the Xe driver for power management tuning.- Intel Xe driver SR-IOV support for CCS surfaces on Xe2+. The SR-IOV PF mode is also now enabled by default on supported platforms. Intel has returned to working on the upstream Habana Labs accelerator driver . There still is no Gaudi 3 support but at least they are back to working on this code under a new set of maintainers.- Intel Xe driver support for madvise in GPU SVM (Shared Virtual Memory).- The Arm Mali Panthor DRM driver added support for Mali G710, G510, G310, Gx15, Gx20, Gx25 GPUs.- Continued work on Nova as the next-generation open-source NVIDIA Linux kernel driver written in Rust.- The initial code around Tyr as a new Rust driver for Arm Mali GPUs . It's not yet usable by end-users, similar to the Nova driver.- Various new Rust abstractions and other work toward making Rust DRM drivers more practical.See this pull for the full list of DRM feature patches this cycle.",

      "headline": "I tested the GMKtec NucBox K12 and I think developers and creators will love the expansive upgrade potential",
      "content": "While classed as a mini PC, the form factor is marginally larger than most. However, with a powerful mid-range CPU and GPU, the extra airflow enabled by the design and the ability to expand potential with an eGPU make this a surprisingly powerful and versatile option. Through the test, it proved exceptionally good for content creation and even mid-range gaming.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nGMKtec NucBox G9: 30-second review\n\nThe moment that the K12 was removed from the box, it was obvious that this was a more measured machine compared with the majority of high-performance Mini PCs that I have looked at in the last year.\n\nFirstly, it's larger, and the design has a depth and flair to it that is lacking from many of the small box machines that I usually test. As I checked over the casing, it was good to see plenty of venting, and while the AMD Ryzen 7 H 225 and AMD Radeon 780M are a powerful combination, these days they sit decidedly in the mid-range. Thankfully, the pricing reflects this, and the larger form also enables plenty of airflow and a pretty decent array of ports across the front and back of the machine.\n\nAgain, while these are all present generation, it seems that GMKtec has gone for high spec, but tried and tested. So, while powerful, there's nothing ground-breaking here, just hardware that the company knows is going to perform and be reliable.\n\nThrough the test, this was certainly the case, and as I ran through the usual array of office applications, web browsing and even delved into image and video editing, the machine, like many of the best mini PCs I've tested, held up with surprising resilience.\n\nAs the pressure was applied with 4K video editing in DaVinci Resolve, the fans kicked in, and while the 1TB internal storage was enough to hold the source files, I connected a working drive through the USB4 ports at the back for more storage, if I was using this machine longer term then I'd install an addition SSD into one of the two spare internal M.2 2280 slots.\n\nThe data transfer rates were excellent, and while the machine certainly has the brute power to process and edit video, internal storage would need an upgrade to be used as a working drive. The USB4 interface, while fast, is nothing compared to the 4000MB/s+ write speeds of the internal drive. Thankfully, those additional slots enable storage to be upgraded to a staggering 24TB, more than enough for even the busiest content creators! Likewise, the RAM can be boosted to 128GB.\n\nGaming performance is equally well balanced, and while you might not be able to ramp the game's graphics to the max, you're going to get some pretty decent gameplay. If you do want to take gaming up a level, then there's the Oculink port so you can attach an eGPU; there's really no limit on the potential.\n\nAre you a pro?

From £409 / $409\n\nFrom £409 / $409 When is it out? Available now\n\nAvailable now Where can you get it? Directly from GMKtec or Amazon\n\nThe GMKtec NucBox K12 is widely available with a price starting at £409/$409 for the barebones version. The model that I've looked at in this review is the 32GB RAM with 1 TB SSD, which will set you back $549/549/£550, or you can order the 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD option for $609/£600 directly from the gmktec.com website. The machine is also available from Amazon.com and AliExpress.\n\nHere are a few quick links with a variety of configurations that I've found:\n\nAmazon.com\n\n32GB / 512GB\n\n32GB / 1TB\n\n64GB / 1TB\n\nAmazon.ca\n\n32GB / 1TB\n\n64GB / 1TB\n\nAmazon.co.uk\n\n32GB / 1TB\n\n64GB / 1TB\n\nGMKtec EU\n\nClick here to see the line-up\n\nValue: 4.5 / 5\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nGMKtec NucBox K12: Specs\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 H 255\n\nGraphics: AMD Radeon 780M\n\nRAM: 32GB DDR5 5600MT (128GB Max)\n\nStorage: 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD\n\nFront Ports: 3.5mm Combo jack, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-C (PD/DP/Data), 2×USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A, USB2.0, Clear CMOS\n\nRear Ports: DC port, 3.5mm Combo jack, HDMI 2.1, DP 1.4, USB4, Oculink (PCIe Gen4×4), USB3.2 Gen2 + USB2.0, 2×2.5G LAN (Realtek 8125BG), Fan/LED control button\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2\n\nAudio: Built-in speakers (basic), headphone/mic combo jack\n\nCamera: None\n\nSize: 117 x 112 x 42 mm\n\nOS Installed: Windows 11 Pro\n\nAccessories: Power adapter, HDMI cable, VESA mount\n\nGMKtec NucBox K12: Design\n\nThe GMKtec NucBox K12 takes a slightly different approach to design compared with many other Mini PCs. Firstly, it's slightly larger, so while still small, there's more airflow potential and plenty of space for accessories.\n\nThe design is clean with a matte black aluminium body, with a folded-over detail that covers the top and bottom fans. On top, there's also a turbo fan button, which gives you some sort of control over the machine's cooling. The main purpose of this machine is as a no-fuss processing machine for content creation, development, or any other task that would put most other machines under sustained strain.\n\nWhile the price point of the machine is decidedly mid-range, the use of metal and the detailing just give this an added feeling of quality, and when you couple that with the fact that even as a mini PC it is so upgradable, you suddenly realise that actually, for what's on offer here, it is exceptionally well-equipped and priced.\n\nWhile the form factor is slightly larger than some others at 117 x 112 x 42 mm and weighing in at X g, it's still light enough to be easily mounted using the VESA mount that's included in the box.\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nAround the front, there's a good selection of ports with 3.5mm combo jack, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-C (PD/DP/Data), 2×USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A, USB2.0 and a Clear CMOS button.\n\nAround the back, there's again a good selection of ports with a DC port, a combo jack, an HDMI 2.1, a DP 1.4, an Oculink (PCIe Gen4×4), USB4, a USB3.2 Gen2 + USB2.0, 2×2.5G LAN (Realtek 8125BG) and a Fan/LED control button on top.\n\nAccess to the insides, where you can add up to three M.2 SSDs and RAM, is made by removing the metal fan cover and then going through the top. Everything is nicely laid out, and access to all hardware is easily available if you do want to upgrade in the future.\n\nDesign: 4.5 / 5\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nGMKtec NucBox K12: Features\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 H 255 offers 8 cores and 16 threads with Zen 4 architecture, and this is coupled with the AMD Radeon 780M with RDNA 3 architecture. In the past, this combination has proven to be well-priced and powerful.\n\nSupporting the processing is an equally impressive range of memory with dual-channel DDR5 5600 MT/s SO-DIMM slots that can take up to two 64GB sticks, giving you 128GB of usable RAM. There are also three M.2 2280 PCIe slots that will enable you to add up to 24TB of storage. This is one of the largest capacities for this price point of Mini PC that I have come across, and again, it is extremely impressive.\n\nIt's worth noting that two of those slots are PCIe 4.0x2, and one is PCIe 4.0x4, with the operating system in the review sample utilising this slot for the SSD to ensure the fastest possible speeds.\n\nUpgradability does seem to be at the heart of this machine. Out of the box, you have a very solid and reliable machine with tried and tested hardware, with a few bits of bang-up-to-date technology to ensure future-proofing. The USB4 offers fast transfer speeds and connection to monitors, and the DDR5 RAM offers exceptional speed.\n\nOn top of the impressive performance I gained from the base 32GB, 1TB SSD review unit, it was obvious with all the cooling options that this machine, if enabled, would have a lot more to give.\n\nWith USB4, USB-C, HDMI and DP ports, you have plenty of potential to link out to monitors at 4K@60Hz, but then with the Oculink port, you can also easily hook into an eGPU for a huge graphics power boost.\n\nAnother feature that reinforces the fact that this machine has been aimed at users who place demands on their systems is the dual 2.5G Ethernet, enabling ultra-fast wired networking, so that there's minimal network lag and again reliability, if again the 2.5G technology is a little dated.\n\nFinally, my review sample arrived with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, but as ever, you can install Linux, Ubuntu or any variation you need.\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nFeatures: 4 / 5\n\nGMKtec NucBox K12: Performance\n\nBenchmark scores CrystalDiskMark Read: 5024.59\n\nCrystalDiskMark Write: 4453.91\n\nGeekbench CPU Multi: 11694\n\nGeekbench CPU Single: 2369\n\nGeekbench GPU: 31240\n\nPCMark Overall: 6705\n\nCinebench CPU Multi: 13519\n\nCinebench CPU Single: 1606\n\nFire Strike Overall: 7512\n\nFire Strike Graphics: 8171\n\nFire Strike Physics: 22243\n\nFire Strike Combined: 2892\n\nTime Spy Overall: 3125\n\nTime Spy Graphics: 2796\n\nTime Spy CPU: 9385\n\nWild Life Overall: 17400\n\nSteel Nomad Overall: 549\n\nWindows Experience Overall: 8.2\n\nGetting started with the GMKtec K12 was fast, with the Wi-Fi connection seeming to be especially robust on the Eero 6 router compared with some of the smaller machines.\n\nAs the machine arrived with Windows 11 Pro installed, it was just a case of running through the standard Windows setup process, and the machine was ready to go.\n\nInitial impressions were good, with the machine running silently and able to cope with multiple browser windows open and editing Google Docs and other spreadsheets without issue. As with most machines these days, the standard office tasks are a given, and everything should run smoothly.\n\nAs the test continued, I installed and opened Photoshop, Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve, quickly pushing the abilities of the machine, but once again the CPU and GPU combo managed to handle everything with seeming ease.\n\nPhotoshop, Lightroom and Bridge in particular ran especially smoothly, with files opening and closing quickly, no doubt due to the exceptionally fast SSD and RAM.\n\nAs I migrated to light video editing in CapCut and then to DaVinci Resolve, the fans did start to kick in, and as graphics were created in Photoshop and brought across to the video editing, there were a few occasions where you could just see the system start to strain. However, it was all well handled, and for an integrated GPU, the Radeon 780M certainly impresses.\n\nAs that processing increased, so did the fan noise, but only slightly. The larger form of the machine, along with the large internal fans, does seem to keep the noise to a minimum, again, a good feature if you're editing video.\n\nChecking through the benchmarks, this reinforced the real-world tests. Microsoft Office and all productivity apps, multimedia worked exceptionally well and as fast and smooth as you could expect on any machine.\n\nCreative applications such as Photoshop and Lightroom run well again, and there's no jittering when using brush tools, and render times in Lightroom are fast.\n\nHowever, as this CPU and GPU are now getting older, they're not supported by AI features or an NPU, so the Photoshop AI processing is noticeably slower than some of the AI-enhanced machines.\n\nAs I moved on to DaVinci Resolve editing 4K video footage from a Sony A7 IV, the results were good. I could feel that I was pushing the system, and the fans kicked in, but short edits were more than achievable, and CapCut, as ever, ran smoothly.\n\nMoving on to gaming, the integrated GPU did start to struggle, and while DiRT Rally and Tekken 8 were perfectly playable, when I moved on to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and then Hogwarts Legacy, the graphics and resolution did need to drop to the lower settings.\n\nIf you do want to use the machine for gaming, then the Oculink port should come into play, and with the cooling and power of the machine in all other respects, this should make a very decent gaming platform.\n\nPerformance: 4 / 5\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nGMKtec NucBox K12: Final verdict\n\n(Image credit: Alastair Jennings)\n\nAs an office machine, the GMKtec K12 is exceptional. Out of the box, it has the speed and reliability to make it a very viable option, and the small size means that it's easily portable if you do need to move it around the office or home.\n\nThe fact that it utilises tried and tested hardware adds to the reliability, and as a machine to test, this has been one of the easiest, just for its speed and ease of use. Likewise, if there is a need to upgrade, then access to the inside is fast, and installation of components should only take a few moments.\n\nWhat I really liked about this machine is just how well-balanced it is. It might be larger than most Mini PCs, but it's still small, and the balance of power and upgradability gives it a level of future-proofing that few other machines of this size or type can offer.\n\nWhen it comes to content creation, the out-of-the-box configuration can handle most business use, short video and image enhancement with ease, and if you need longer productions, then it has the potential and power, especially with a bit of a storage upgrade.\n\nWhile the CPU and GPU are good, they do start to feel the strain under gaming, especially, but even then, with the Oculink option, there's potential.\n\nAs a good, well-priced all-rounder with plenty of upgrade potential, the K12 is a superb option.\n\nShould I buy the GMKtec NucBox K12?\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Value Exceptionally well-priced machine with plenty of potential 4.5 Design Great design with a larger form factor that enables plenty of airflow for heavy workloads 4.5 Features A good balance of older and new technology offers speed and reliability 4 Performance Very capable machine for most tasks, including video, with plenty of upgrade potential 4 Overalls A well thought-through machine that can expand as you need 4.5\n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou need power For coders, video editors, or professionals who want to save space and have portability without sacrificing performance. Desk space matters Perfect for minimal setups, VESA mounting if you want to clear your desk, or small enough for travel.\n\nDon't buy it if...",

      "headline": "Nintendo Switch 2 supports two different types of Nvidia DLSS — A second, 'light' version for upscaling beyond 1080p, along with the standard, PC-like CNN model",
      "content": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is the only mainstream console that comes with Nvidia hardware inside, while Microsoft and Sony rely on AMD. Therefore, the Switch 2 supports Nvidia's proprietary DLSS technology that helps it upscale games to 1080p and beyond, which is crucial in a handheld with power constraints. It was long speculated that the version of DLSS present on the Switch 2 was unique and unlike the standard models available on PC, and Digital Foundry's latest testing has confirmed that.\n\nNintendo Switch 2 DLSS Image Quality Analysis: \"Tiny\" DLSS/Full-Fat DLSS Confirmed - YouTube Watch On\n\nWhile looking at a diverse selection of titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars Outlaws, The Touryst, and Fast Fusion; Digital Foundry observed that there are two different DLSS versions at work.\n\nFirst up, there's \"Fat DLSS\" that resembles the CNN-based model found on PC, and this can only upscale games to 1080p. It has a cleaner, sharper image in motion, less artifacting, better antialiasing, and smoother camera cuts. Objects move in and out of motion almost identically to how they would on PC — which is to say, gracefully.\n\nBut, as mentioned, it's limited to 1080p. To go past that resolution, Nvidia and Nintendo have developed a special \"DLSS Light\" which can upscale to greater resolutions (remember, Switch 2 is marketed for up to 4K when docked). This version looks better in stills, but looses sharpness as soon as you move because reconstruction techniques get temporarily disabled. It introduces artifacts where you can see unfiltered pixels, but at the benefit of half the frame-time cost, which allows it to scale way past just 1080p.\n\n(Image credit: Jeffrey Kampman/Tom's Hardware)\n\nThis goes to show just how demanding the original version of DLSS is; it doesn't make sense to run that on every game, especially in handheld mode. When you need to reach resolutions higher than 1080p, the light model should still be better, despite its inferior temporal performance. What remains to be seen, though, is whether the newer, more efficient Transformer-based model of DLSS can somehow make its way onto the Switch 2 in the future.\n\nDigital Foundry even reached out to an unnamed but respected developer familiar with DLSS on the Switch, who confirmed that two versions of the tech do indeed exist in the pipeline to choose from. The light version is newer, and more uniquely suited to the Switch 2's hardware capabilities. We haven't seen any first-party Nintendo game utilize DLSS so far either, so that's also something to keep an eye on, given how most Nintendo games focus on precise movement and controls.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

      "headline": "Matrix Core Programming on AMD GPUs",
      "content": "TL;DR In this blog post, we walk through how to use Matrix Cores in HIP kernels, with a focus on low-precision data types such as FP16, FP8, and FP4, as well as the new family of Matrix Core instructions with exponent block scaling introduced in the AMD CDNA™4 architecture. Through code examples and illustrations, we provide the necessary knowledge to start programming Matrix Cores, covering modern low-precision floating-point types, the Matrix Core compiler intrinsics, and the data layouts required by the Matrix Core instructions. The blog post is also available on ROCm Blogs.\n\n1. Matrix Cores\n\nMatrix multiplication is an essential part of AI and HPC workloads. The AMD CDNA™ architecture features special-purpose hardware, the Matrix Cores, to accelerate matrix fused-multiply-add (MFMA) operations defined as D:=A*B+C . Please note that MFMA instructions are often used to update a matrix in-place (=accumulation) so that D=C and C:=A*B+C . The matrices A and B are called input matrices, while the matrix D is referred to as the output matrix or accumulator.\n\nThe performance gains from using Matrix Cores are especially significant in mixed-precision mode, where the input matrices use lower-precision data types instead of FP32. The output matrix, however, is stored in FP32 to minimize accuracy loss during accumulation. The tables below show the theoretical peak performance of Matrix Cores with different input data types on both AMD CDNA™3 and AMD CDNA™4 architectures. On the AMD Instinct™ MI325X, using FP16 input matrices delivers nearly an 8x performance increase compared to single-precision, with only minimal accuracy loss. Switching to FP8 further doubles the performance providing a 16x increase when compared to FP32. The AMD CDNA™4 architecture further improves Matrix Core performance, delivering up to 2x higher throughput for FP16 and FP8 compared to the AMD CDNA™3 architecture. In addition, AMD CDNA™4 introduces new low-precision data types such as FP6 and FP4, enabling up to 64x performance gain relative to FP32. Please refer to the AMD CDNA™3 and AMD CDNA™4 white papers for detailed architecture specifications.\n\nType AMD Instinct™ MI325X (CDNA™3) Speedup vs. FP32 Matrix FP64 163.4 TF 1x Matrix FP32 163.4 TF 1x Matrix FP16 1307.4 TF ~8x Matrix FP8 2614.9 TF ~16x\n\nType AMD Instinct™ MI355X (CDNA™4) Speedup vs. FP32 Matrix FP64 78.6 TF ~0.5x Matrix FP32 157.3 TF 1x Matrix FP16 2.5 PF ~16x Matrix FP8 5 PF ~32x Matrix FP6 10 PF ~64x Matrix FP4 10 PF ~64x\n\n2. Low-Precision Floating-Point Types\n\nA binary representation of a floating-point number consists of n bits, where m of n bits represent the mantissa, 1 bit determines the sign and n-m-1 bits represent the exponent. The following image illustrates the binary format of a floating-point number and how the exponent and mantissa are calculated based on its binary representation.\n\nFigure 1: Binary representation of a floating-point number.\n\nFloating-point types are characterized by the number of bits used for the exponent and for the mantissa. Increasing the exponent width extends the range of representable values, while increasing the mantissa width improves precision. Since all floating-point types include the sign bit, a shorthand notation typically specifies only the exponent and mantissa widths. For example, the E4M3 type is an 8-bit floating-point type with 4-bit exponent and 3-bit mantissa. Additionally, a floating-point type is specified by exponent bias - a number that is subtracted from the exponent during conversion from binary format to real value. Given the exponent width, mantissa width, and exponent bias, one can convert the binary representation of a floating-point type (except E8M0) into its real value using the following equation:\n\nFigure 2: Conversion to real value from binary representation for floating-point numbers.\n\nPlease note that the equation takes different forms depending on whether the exponent is zero or not. Often, certain exponent and mantissa values are reserved for special values (e.g. NaN , Infinity ), which limits the range of representable real numbers. For example, the FP16 type has 5-bit exponent with a nominal range of [0, 1, ... 2^5-1] = [0, 1, ... 31] . However, the exponent value E = 31 is reserved for NaN (if the mantissa M != 0 ) and infinity (if the mantissa M = 0 ). Therefore, the largest exponent value that can represent a real number is E = 30 .\n\nThe following table summarizes low-precision types commonly used in modern AI/ML workloads:\n\nWidth Shorthand Exp. bias Range Zero NaN Infinity 16-Bit E5M10 (FP16) 15 ±65504 S 00000 0000000000 S 11111 xxxxxxxxxx S 11111 0000000000 E8M7 (BF16) 127 ±3.3895 * 10^38 S 00000000 0000000 S 11111111 xxxxxxx S 11111111 0000000 8-Bit E4M3FN (FP8, OCP) 7 ±448 S 0000 000 S 1111 111 n/a E4M3FNUZ (FP8) 8 ±240 0 0000 000 1 0000 000 n/a E5M2 (BF8, OCP) 15 ±57344 S 00000 00 S 11111 {01, 10 11} S 11111 00 E5M2FNUZ (BF8) 16 ±57344 0 00000 00 S 00000 00 n/a E8M0 127 2^(±127) n/a 11111111 n/a 6-Bit E2M3 1 ±7.5 S 00 000 n/a n/a E3M2 (BF6) 3 ±28 S 000 00 n/a n/a 4-Bit E2M1 (FP4) 1 ±6 S 00 0 n/a n/a\n\nPlease note that the E4M3 type has two variants: E4M3FN and E4M3FNUZ. Both E4M3FN and E4M3FNUZ use 4 bits for the exponent and 3 bits for the mantissa. They use different exponent biases and differ in the special values they can represent. Neither variant supports infinities, which is why their notations include FN (FiNite). However, E4M3FN supports +0 , -0 , +NaN and -Nan , while E4M3FNUZ supports only +0 and NaN , hence UZ (Unsigned Zero). The image below demonstrates how to convert a binary sequence into a real value, using E4M3FNUZ type as an example:\n\nFigure 3: E4M3FNUZ encoding details.\n\nFP8 types are divided into E4M3 and E5M2 formats. The E5M2 format is sometimes referred to as BF8, similar to BF16, where exponent width is larger compared to FP16. Similar to E4M3, E5M2 is further subdivided into two variants: E5M2 (OCP) and E5M2FNUZ. The AMD CDNA™3 architecture uses FNUZ variants for both E4M3 and E5M2, whereas the CDNA™4 architecture uses E4M3FN and E5M2 (OCP) variants. E4M3FN and E5M2 are standardized formats defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). For detailed specifications, see the OCP Microscaling Formats (MX) Specification and the ONNX documentation. For visualization of FP8 values and their binary representations please refer to the FP8 Data table. Additionally, see the chapter “Low-precision floating-point types” in the AMD ROCm™ documentation for details on using low-precision types in HIP.\n\nThere is a special 8-bit format, E8M0, which is not used as a standard element data type but instead serves as a scale factor for microscaling types and block-scaled MFMA operations (discussed later in this article). Its value is calculated according to the equation below:\n\nFigure 4: E8M0 encoding details.\n\nThe exponent value E = 255 is reserved for NaN values, limiting the range of representable real numbers to [2^-127 ... 2^127] .\n\nSimilar to FP8, FP6 has two formats: E2M3 and E3M2. The latter, E3M2, is often referred to as BF6 due to its larger exponent width compared to E2M3.\n\n3. Matrix fused-multiply-add (MFMA) Instructions\n\nThe AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures support a variety of MFMA operations, which are characterized by the matrix dimensions M , N , K and the data type of input/output matrices. The following table lists all available floating-point MFMA instructions for the AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures. As can be seen from the table, the AMD CDNA™4 architecture extends the set of available MFMA instructions by adding new FP16/BF16 instructions with larger matrix dimensions. Furthermore, it introduces FP6/FP4 data types and provides a completely new set of FP8/FP6/FP4 instructions where the types can be independently used for the matrices A and B . Finally, the AMD CDNA™4 architecture enables MFMA with block exponent scaling.\n\nType (C,D) ← (A,B) MxNxK (CDNA™3) MxNxK (CDNA™4) Cycles Note FP64 ← FP64 16x16x4 16x16x4 64 FP32 ← FP32 32x32x2 32x32x2 64 16x16x4 16x16x4 32 FP32 ← FP16 (BF16) 32x32x8 32x32x8 32 Both A and B are either FP16 or BF16 16x16x16 16x16x16 16 - 16x16x32 16 - 32x32x16 32 FP32 ← FP8 16x16x32 16x16x32 16 FP8 (E4M3) or BF8 (E5M2) can be used independently for A and B 32x32x16 32x32x16 32 FP32 ← FP8/FP6/FP4 - 16x16x128 16 or 32 FP4, FP6 or FP8 can be used independently for A and B. Larger cycle count if either matrix A or B is FP8 - 32x32x64 32 or 64 FP32 ← MXFP8/MXFP6/MXFP4 - 16x16x128 16 or 32 FP4, FP6 or FP8 can be used independently for A and B. Larger cycle count if either matrix A or B is FP8 - 32x32x64 32 or 64\n\nPlease note that the table lists only floating-point type MFMA instructions with batch size = 1. In addition to them, the AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures support batched MFMA operations, where multiple output matrices are computed in parallel. These instructions are not covered in this article. See the Chapter 7 “Matrix Arithmetic Instructions” in the AMD CDNA™3 and AMD CDNA™4 ISA reference guides for the full list of available MFMA instructions.\n\nThe table above specifies cycle count for each MFMA operation. Given a known cycle count, one can estimate theoretical peak performance in TFLOP/s of corresponding MFMA operation using the formula below:\n\n2*M*N*K * num_matrix_cores * (max_engine_clock / cycle_count) / 10^6,\n\nwhere\n\nnum_matrix_cores is total number of matrix cores in a GPU (specified in white paper) max_engine_clock is max engine clock (peak) in MHz (specified in white paper) cycle_count is cycle count of corresponding MFMA instruction M, N, K are matrix dimensions\n\nUsing this formula and the MFMA instruction 32x32x8 FP16 as an example, we can estimate theoretical peak FP16 Matrix Core performance on the AMD Instinct™ MI325X:\n\n2*32*32*8 * 1216 * (2100 / 32) / 10^6 = 1307.4 TFLOP/s .\n\n4. Compiler Intrinsics\n\nTo use Matrix Core instructions in HIP kernels, LLVM provides built-in compiler intrinsic functions. The list of all available compiler intrinsics can be found in the LLVM Github repository. The syntax of the MFMA intrinsics has the following format:\n\nd_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_ODType_MxNxKInDType(a_reg, b_reg, c_reg, cbsz, abid, blgp) ,\n\nwhere\n\nMxNxK specifies the shapes of the matrices A , B , C , D , ODType is data type of the matrices C and D , InDType is data type of the input matrices A and B , a_reg is a scalar/vector containing a portion of the matrix A , b_reg is a scalar/vector containing a portion of the matrix B , c_reg is a vector containing a portion of the matrix C , d_reg is a vector containing a portion of the matrix D , cbsz , abid , blgp are broadcast flags. For the following discussion, these flags are irrelevant and are, therefore, set to 0 by default, unless specified otherwise. Please refer to the ISA reference guide for detailed information on the broadcast flags.\n\nFor example,\n\n__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16 performs 16x16x16 MFMA, where both input matrices A and B have type FP16 and the output matrix has type FP32 __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8 performs 32x32x16 MFMA, where both input matrices A and B have type FP8(E4M3) and the output matrix is stored in FP32 __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_bf8 performs 32x32x16 MFMA, where the matrix A has type FP8(E4M3) and the matrix B has type BF8(E5M2) .\n\nThe MFMA instructions are wavefront-level (warp-level) instructions, where all work-items (threads) within a wavefront collectively perform a single MFMA operation and the operands A , B , C , D are distributed across work-items so that each work-item in the wavefront holds a portion of the operands. In order to use the MFMA instructions, it’s required to understand how the operands are distributed across threads within a wavefront. The ISA reference guide fully specifies the data layout for all available MFMA instructions. For illustrative purposes, the next chapter explains a subset of the MFMA instructions and the corresponding data layouts.\n\n5. Examples\n\nImportant note: In the following discussion we assume the matrices are stored in row-major order. The wavefront size on the AMD CDNA™ architecture is 64. The shapes of the matrices A , B , C , D are MxK , KxN , MxN , and MxN , respectively. The first dimension denotes the number of rows and the second dimension the number of columns in a matrix. For example, the matrix A has M rows and K columns.\n\n5.1. __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x2f32\n\nIn this example we will multiply matrix A of size 32x2 with matrix B of size 2x32 using single wavefront (64 threads) and single MFMA instruction. The output matrix C has shape 32x32 . The input and output matrices are FP32. Since threads within a wavefront collectively perform single MFMA instruction, the operands are distributed across the threads. Each thread stores\n\nM * K / wavefront_size = 32 * 2 / 64 = 1 entries of the matrix A K * N / wavefront_size = 2 * 32 / 64 = 1 entries of the matrix B M * N / wavefront_size = 32 * 32 / 64 = 16 entries of the matrix C\n\nThe operands are distributed according to the scheme below. The matrix elements highlighted in light red are those stored by the thread with index 0 within the wavefront.\n\nFigure 5: Data layout for `__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x2f32`. The operands are stored in row-major order.\n\nThe code example below demonstrates how this operation can be implemented as a HIP kernel:\n\n#include <hip/hip_runtime.h> using fp32x16_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 16 * sizeof ( float )))) float ; __global__ void mfma_fp32_32x32x2_fp32 ( const float * A , const float * B , float * C ) { float a_reg ; float b_reg ; fp32x16_t c_reg {}; const float * ldg_a_ptr = A + threadIdx . x / 32 + 2 * ( threadIdx . x % 32 ); const float * ldg_b_ptr = B + threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 32 ; a_reg = * ldg_a_ptr ; b_reg = * ldg_b_ptr ; c_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x2f32 ( a_reg , b_reg , c_reg , 0 , 0 , 0 ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 1 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 1 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 2 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 2 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 3 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 3 ]; } }\n\nThe GPU kernel can then be invoked on the host using a single wavefront:\n\nmfma_fp32_32x32x2_fp32 <<< 1 , 64 >>> ( A_device , B_device , C_device );\n\nPlease note that we use the vector data type fp32x16_t to store the entries of the matrix C in registers. Additionally, we zero-initialize c , since we compute C = A * B without accumulation.\n\n5.2. __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16\n\nThis example demonstrates how to multiply matrix A of size 16x16 with matrix B of size 16x16 using single wavefront (64 threads) and single MFMA instruction. The output matrix C has shape 16x16 . The input matrices are stored in FP16 and the output matrix stored in FP32. In this case, each thread stores 4 entries of the matrix A , 4 entries of the matrix B and 4 entries of the matrix C . The data layout for this instruction is shown below. For illustrative purposes, the elements stored by the first thread within the wavefront are highlighted in red.\n\nFigure 6: Data layout for __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16. The operands are stored in row-major order.\n\nCorresponding HIP kernel is implemented below:\n\n#include <hip/hip_runtime.h> #include <hip/hip_fp16.h> using fp16_t = _Float16 ; using fp16x4_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 4 * sizeof ( fp16_t )))) fp16_t ; using fp32x4_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 4 * sizeof ( float )))) float ; __global__ void mfma_fp32_16x16x16_fp16 ( const fp16_t * A , const fp16_t * B , float * C ) { fp16x4_t a_reg ; fp16x4_t b_reg ; fp32x4_t c_reg {}; a_reg = * reinterpret_cast < const fp16x4_t *> ( A + 4 * ( threadIdx . x / 16 ) + 16 * ( threadIdx . x % 16 )); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { b_reg [ i ] = * ( B + i * 16 + threadIdx . x % 16 + ( threadIdx . x / 16 ) * 64 ); } c_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16 ( a_reg , b_reg , c_reg , 0 , 0 , 0 ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { * ( C + i * 16 + threadIdx . x % 16 + ( threadIdx . x / 16 ) * 64 ) = c_reg [ i ]; } }\n\nPlease note that both __half and _Float16 types can be used in device code. However, the host supports only _Float16 type for arithmetic operations. As in the previous example, we use vector data types to store the matrix elements in registers.\n\n5.3. __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8\n\nIn this example we will multiply matrix A of size 32x16 with matrix B of size 16x32 using single wavefront (64 threads) and single MFMA instruction. The output matrix C has shape 32x32 . The input matrices are stored in FP8 and the output matrix is stored in FP32. In this scenario, each thread stores 8 elements of the matrix A , 8 elements of the matrix B and 16 elements of the matrix C . The operands are distributed according to the scheme below. For illustrative purposes, the elements stored by the first thread within the wavefront are highlighted in red.\n\nFigure 7: Data layout for __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8. The operands are stored in row-major order.\n\nThe code example below implements this operation as a HIP kernel:\n\n#include <hip/hip_runtime.h> #include <hip/hip_fp8.h> using fp8_t = __hip_fp8_storage_t ; using fp8x8_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 8 * sizeof ( fp8_t )))) fp8_t ; using fp32x16_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 16 * sizeof ( float )))) float ; __global__ void mfma_fp32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8 ( const fp8_t * A , const fp8_t * B , float * C ) { fp8x8_t a_reg ; fp8x8_t b_reg ; fp32x16_t c_reg {}; a_reg = * reinterpret_cast < const fp8x8_t *> ( A + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 8 + ( threadIdx . x % 32 ) * 16 ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 8 ; i ++ ) { b_reg [ i ] = * ( B + i * 32 + threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 8 * 32 ); } c_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8 (( long ) a_reg , ( long ) b_reg , c_reg , 0 , 0 , 0 ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 1 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 1 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 2 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 2 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 3 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 3 ]; } }\n\nTo define FP8, we use __hip_fp8_storage_t type from hip_fp8.h . Note that the intrinsic function expects its first two operands to be of type long . To compile the code, the operands a and b are, therefore, converted to long .\n\n5.4. __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f8\n\nImportant note: the MFMA instruction discussed in this example is supported only on AMD CDNA™4 GPUs (gfx950). Please make sure to install AMD ROCm™ version 7.0 or later.\n\nThe AMD CDNA™4 architecture introduces a new family of MFMA instructions with block exponent scaling. The syntax of these instructions differs from the classic MFMA compiler intrinsics:\n\nd_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_MxNxK_f8f6f4(a_reg, b_reg, c_reg, Atype, Btype, OPSEL_A, scale_a, OPSEL_B, scale_b)\n\nMxNxK specifies shapes of the matrices A , B , C , D a_reg is a vector containing elements of the matrix A , b_reg is a vector containing elements of the matrix B , c_reg is a vector containing elements of the matrix C , d_reg is a vector containing elements of the matrix D , Atype is an integer that specifies the data type of the matrix A . The following values are possible: 0 = E4M3 (fp8), 1 = E5M2(bf8), 2 = E2M3(fp6), 3 = E3M2(bf6), 4 = E2M1(fp4) , Btype is an integer that specifies the data type of the matrix B . The following values are possible: 0 = E4M3 (fp8), 1 = E5M2(bf8), 2 = E2M3(fp6), 3 = E3M2(bf6), 4 = E2M1(fp4) , OPSEL_A , OPSEL_B are OPSEL codes. These arguments are not relevant for the discussion and therefore will be set to 0 , scale_a , scale_b are scalars / vectors containing scale factors of type E8M0 .\n\nAs an example, let’s take a closer look at the instruction __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 . The inputs to this instruction are\n\nMatrix A of size 32x64 Matrix Ax of size 32x2 Matrix B of size 64x32 Matrix Bx of size 2x32\n\nThe output matrix C has shape 32x32 . Specifically, this instruction performs the following operation using single wavefront (64 threads):\n\nFigure 8: Block-scaled matrix multiplication via __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4.\n\nDuring dot product operations, the scales Ax , Bx are applied after the normal dot product and prior to output/accumulation.\n\nIn this example, we will multiply two FP8 matrices using the __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 intrinsic function. The input matrices A , B are stored in FP8 format, while the output matrix is stored in FP32. The scale matrices Ax , Bx contain elements of type E8M0 . Each thread stores 32 entries from the matrix A , 1 entry from the matrix Ax , 32 entries from the matrix B , 1 entry from the matrix Bx and 16 entries from the matrix C . The operands are distributed according to the scheme below. Please note that this scheme is valid only if both input matrices A and B have FP8 type. For illustrative purposes, the matrix elements stored by the thread with threadIdx.x = 0 are highlighted in light red, while the elements stored by the thread with threadIdx.x = 32 within the wavefront are highlighted in light green.\n\nFigure 9: Data layout for __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 with FP8 input matrices. The operands are stored in row-major order.\n\nThe following code example shows how this operation can be implemented as a HIP kernel:\n\n#include <hip/hip_runtime.h> #include <hip/hip_ext_ocp.h> using fp8_t = __amd_fp8_storage_t ; using fp8x32_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 32 * sizeof ( fp8_t )))) fp8_t ; using fp32x16_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 16 * sizeof ( float )))) float ; __global__ void mfma_fp32_32x32x64_fp8_fp8 ( const fp8_t * A , const fp8_t * B , float * C ) { fp8x32_t a_reg ; fp8x32_t b_reg ; fp32x16_t c_reg {}; const fp8_t * ldg_a = A + ( threadIdx . x % 32 ) * 64 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 16 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 2 ; i ++ ) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < 16 ; j ++ ) { a_reg [ i * 16 + j ] = * ( ldg_a + i * 32 + j ); } } const fp8_t * ldg_b = B + threadIdx . x % 32 + 32 * 16 * ( threadIdx . x / 32 ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 2 ; i ++ ) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < 16 ; j ++ ) { b_reg [ i * 16 + j ] = * ( ldg_b + 32 * j + i * 32 * 32 ); } } uint8_t scale_a = 127 ; uint8_t scale_b = 127 ; c_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 ( a_reg , b_reg , c_reg , 0 , 0 , 0 , scale_a , 0 , scale_b ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 1 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 1 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 2 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 2 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 3 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 3 ]; } }\n\nPlease note that in this example we use __amd_fp8_storage_t type defined in hip_ext_ocp.h to represent FP8. This library provides extensions APIs for low-precision and micro-scaling formats, and compared to hip_fp8.h , exposes a wider capability set. gfx950 provides hardware acceleration for these APIs. Most of the APIs are 1 to 1 mapping of hardware instruction. Additionally, we use uint8_t type to represent E8M0 scale factors. Since scale_a and scale_b encode exponent values, the corresponding actual scale factors are 2^(scale_a - 127) and 2^(scale_b - 127) . If scale_a = scale_b = 127 , the actual scale factors are equal to 1 and no scaling is applied.\n\n5.5. __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f4f4\n\nIn our last example, we demonstrate how to multiply two FP4 matrices using the __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 intrinsic function. As in the previous example, each thread stores 32 entries from the matrix A , 1 entry from the matrix Ax , 32 entries from the matrix B , 1 entry from the matrix Bx and 16 entries from the matrix C . The data layout for the output matrix remains the same as in the FP8 case. However, the data layout for the input matrices is different and depicted below. For illustrative purposes, the matrix elements stored by the thread with threadIdx.x = 0 are highlighted in light red, while the elements stored by the thread with threadIdx.x = 32 within the wavefront are highlighted in light green.\n\nFigure 10: Data layout for __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 with FP4 input matrices. The operands are stored in row-major order.\n\nThe code snippet below demonstrates how to implement this operation as a HIP kernel:\n\n#include <hip/hip_runtime.h> #include <hip/hip_ext_ocp.h> using fp4x2_t = __amd_fp4x2_storage_t ; using fp4x64_t = fp4x2_t __attribute__ (( ext_vector_type ( 32 ))); using fp32x16_t = __attribute__ (( vector_size ( 16 * sizeof ( float )))) float ; __global__ void mfma_fp32_32x32x64_fp4_fp4 ( const fp4x2_t * A , const fp4x2_t * B , float * C ) { fp4x64_t a_reg {}; fp4x64_t b_reg {}; fp32x16_t c_reg {}; const fp4x2_t * ldg_a = A + ( threadIdx . x % 32 ) * 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 16 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 16 ; i ++ ) { a_reg [ i ] = * ( ldg_a + i ); } const fp4x2_t * ldg_b = B + ( threadIdx . x % 32 ) / 2 + 16 * 32 * ( threadIdx . x / 32 ); int b_extract_idx = threadIdx . x % 2 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 16 ; i ++ ) { uint8_t tmp0 = __amd_extract_fp4 ( * ( ldg_b + 16 * 2 * i ), b_extract_idx ); uint8_t tmp1 = __amd_extract_fp4 ( * ( ldg_b + 16 * ( 2 * i + 1 )), b_extract_idx ); b_reg [ i ] = __amd_create_fp4x2 ( tmp0 , tmp1 ); } uint8_t scale_a = 127 ; uint8_t scale_b = 127 ; c_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 ( a_reg , b_reg , c_reg , 4 , 4 , 0 , scale_a , 0 , scale_b ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i ++ ) { C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 1 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 1 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 2 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 2 ]; C [ threadIdx . x % 32 + ( threadIdx . x / 32 ) * 4 * 32 + 32 * 3 + i * 32 * 8 ] = c_reg [ i * 4 + 3 ]; } }\n\nSince memory addressing is not allowed at a granularity smaller than 8 bits, we use __amd_fp4x2_storage_t (an alias for uint8_t ) to store the input matrices and enable pointer operations. Note that the FP4 elements that need to be loaded from the matrix B are not contiguous in memory. To extract a single FP4 element, we use the __amd_extract_fp4 function provided in hip_ext_ocp.h . This function returns one FP4 element (of type uint8_t ) from a fp4x2 vector, based on the index passed as the second argument:\n\nuint8_t __amd_extract_fp4 ( const __amd_fp4x2_storage_t x , const size_t index ) { if ( index == 0 ) return ( x & 0xFu ); return ( x >> 4 ); }\n\nTwo FP4 values are then combined into __amd_fp4x2_storage_t using __amd_create_fp4x2 :\n\n__amd_fp4x2_storage_t __amd_create_fp4x2 ( const uint8_t x , const uint8_t y ) { __amd_fp4x2_storage_t ret = 0 ; ret = x | ( y << 4 ); return ret ; }\n\nThe compiler intrinsic function __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4 requires its first two arguments to be 256 bits wide. Since 32 FP4 elements occupy only 128 bits, we define fp4x64_t , which is 256 bits wide. In this type, 128 bits contain data, while the remaining 128 bits are zero. This allows us to pass a_reg and b_reg to the intrinsic function and compile the code successfully.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this article, we introduced Matrix Core instructions available on the AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures. We covered floating-point formats in detail, including modern low-precision element data types such as FP8, FP6, FP4, and the scale data type E8M0. We further explained how the floating-point types are represented as binary sequences and demonstrated, with concrete examples, how to convert their binary representations into real values. Next, we listed Matrix Core instructions supported by the modern CDNA™ architectures and discussed how to calculate the theoretical peak performance of Matrix Cores for specific MFMA instructions. To make the discussion more practical, we reviewed the compiler intrinsic functions that allow users to program Matrix Cores inside HIP kernels. Finally, we examined a subset of MFMA instructions in detail, providing code examples and illustrations to explain data layout and demonstrate how to implement simple mixed-precision MFMA operations in HIP.

From $1,179.99\n\nFrom $1,179.99 When is it out? Available now\n\nAvailable now Where can you get it? Direct from Asus now, online retailers later\n\nTechnically, the Asus ExpertBook P3 (PM3606) has been available for bulk purchases directly from Asus since June 2025, but it’s soon going to be more widely available through retail outlets for those wanting to make smaller investments.\n\nIn the USA, prices start at $1,179.99 for a machine with an AMD Ryzen AI 5 330 Processor, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. For one with the review hardware spec, AMD Ryzen AI 7 350, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, expect to pay $1509.99. Discounts are available for those in the military, students and teacher groups.\n\nAsus in the USA will sell individual units, but in Europe, the minimum purchase is three machines, and the price is typically quoted.\n\nWhen you compare this machine to the HP ProBook 4 G1a, a 14-inch laptop that uses the AMD Ryzen 7 250 with Radeon 780M Graphics, the Asus seems to offer more for roughly the same amount of money.\n\nBut many machine makers have chosen $ 1,500 as the price point for this platform, even though you can get the Ryzen 7 250 systems for much closer to $ 1,000.\n\nFor volume buyers, this machine will likely fall somewhere in between, depending on the amount of memory and storage requested.\n\nValue: 4 / 5\n\nAsus ExpertBook P3: Specs\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Category Item Processor AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 2.0GHz (16MB Cache, up to 5.0 GHz, 8 cores, 16 Threads) NPU Performance 50 TOPS (Neural Processing Unit for local AI tasks) Total TOPS 66 TOPS (NPU and CPU combined) Memory 32 GB DDR5-5600 (two slots, up to 64GB possible) Storage 1 TB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD Storage Exp.

One of the most striking features of this laptop is its thin profile. Measuring just 1.79 to 1.80 centimetres in height, the ExpertBook P3 is incredibly slim, making it highly portable and easy to carry around. This thinness does not compromise its durability, as Asus created a robust aluminium chassis that should withstand the rigours of daily use for longer than something made entirely of plastic.\n\nThe port selection on the Asus ExpertBook P3 is great, catering to a wide range of connectivity needs. It includes two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports and two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports that support display and power delivery. Additionally, there is an HDMI 2.1 port, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, and an RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet port.\n\nMy only reservations here are that the best USB available is only USB 3.2 Gen 2, whereas USB4 is inherent to this processor series, and the cost saving of a gigabit Ethernet over 2.5GbE probably wasn’t worth it.\n\nOn the upside of the port arrangement, there are plenty of ports, ensuring that users can connect multiple devices simultaneously, whether for presentations, data transfer, or internet connectivity. That negates the need for a docking station, unless you want more than two screens.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nAnother standout feature is the 16-inch display of the ExpertBook P3. It boasts a WUXGA (1920 x 1200) resolution with a 16:10 aspect ratio, providing a wide and immersive viewing experience. In the P3 range specifications, it hints that a higher resolution panel with greater than 300 nits of brightness is an option, but for most uses, this display is fine.\n\nObviously, it doesn’t offer the exacting colour representation as an OLED display, but then this machine isn’t priced to expect one of those.\n\nIn addition to its impressive hardware, the Asus ExpertBook P3 is designed with user comfort and productivity in mind. The backlit chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm key travel is spill-resistant, making it both comfortable to type on and resilient to accidental spills. There are only two things about it I’m less than enamoured with, the first of those being that the designers split the return key in half to put the hash key on the top half. Another space issue is one of those direction clusters where the up and down buttons are half the size of the left and right directions. Considering how much space the 16-inch form factor allowed for the keyboard, a better use of space should have been possible.\n\nThe laptop also features a 1080p FHD camera with IR function for Windows Hello, ensuring secure and convenient login, and the power button is also a fingerprint reader if you prefer that biometric approach. The combination of these features makes the ExpertBook P3 a versatile and reliable choice for professionals who need a powerful and portable laptop.\n\nIn conclusion, the Asus ExpertBook P3 (PM3606) is a well-designed laptop that excels in terms of thinness, port selection, and features a decent display quality. Its slim profile, comprehensive connectivity options, and high-quality display make it an excellent choice for professionals who require a reliable and portable device for their daily tasks.\n\nHowever, at 1.75kg, holding this machine by one corner does require a reasonable amount of wrist and arm strength, and therefore, it’s not ideal for use unsupported.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nDesign: 4 / 5\n\nAsus ExpertBook P3: Hardware\n\nAMD Ryzen 300 AI series CPU\n\nRadeon 860M GPU\n\nSome upgrades\n\nIt’s interesting to compare this Ryzen AI 300 series CPU to the one that was in the HP ProBook 4 G1a, as the Ryzen 7 250 in the HP wasn’t from the Ryzen AI 300 (Krackan Point) series, but the Ryzen 200 (Hawk Point) refresh.\n\nThis architecture marks the first step that AMD has taken in the same direction as Intel, dividing cores into those that are purely for performance and others that are more focused on efficiency. To that end, the AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 has four Zen 5 performance cores and four Zen 5c efficiency cores, but both core types offer hyperthreading, allowing for a thread count of sixteen. That’s double what Intel is offering with the Core Ultra 7 258V, and it’s comparable to that in the Core Ultra 9 models.\n\nBut, my testing suggests that for multitasking, this chip is significantly better than the Core Ultra 7 258V, and AMD has the Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375, which is better than anything Intel has in its mobile chip space.\n\nWhere this processor also excels is AI neural processing, as it includes the AMD NPU that’s rated at 50TOPS, and another 16TOPS coming directly from the processor.\n\nThe combined 66TOPS is more than enough to run CoPilot locally and also handle some other localised AI tools. For those entirely dedicated to local AI, the Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375 has a 55TOPS NPU and a combined 126TOPS, but what the Ryzen AI 7 350 has is much better than some processors.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nThe Core 7 Ultra 165U, for example, only has an NPU that’s rated at 11 TOPS, and doesn’t meet the minimum 50 TOPS combined level to run CoPilot locally.\n\nGiven how hard Intel has been pushing the AI button recently, you’d think they actually had silicon that could walk that walk.\n\nIn short, there are other chips from AMD that deliver even more AI computing power, but the Ryzen AI 7 350 is more than respectable for those who use this technology.\n\nIf a weakness exists here, it’s the GPU, which is the Radeon 860M. While this might not be Intel UHD Graphics bad, and will render raytracing tests, the recent appearance of the Radeon 8060S on the new Ryzen 9 AI chips has put something of a shadow over the 860M, 880M and even 890M GPUs.\n\nThat said, it delivers more than enough graphics power for typical office use, but it doesn’t elevate the ExpertBook P3 into the realms of a mobile workstation.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nFor those who like to upgrade, the news is good and yet not so wonderful, depending on what sort of enhancements you wish to make.\n\nThe first thing to say about this machine is that getting inside isn’t that easy, even if you only need to remove six screws, in theory.\n\nThe underside of the P3 uses a metal cover that is held in place by a large number of clips once the screws have been removed. Getting enough of these to open sufficiently to remove the back isn’t easy, even for someone who wields a spudger semi-professionally. This exercise isn’t something you will want to do multiple times, so consider this a drive-by upgrade.\n\nOnce inside, you will discover that there are two DDR5 SODIM slots, two M.2 slots and an extra one for the WiFi. You can replace the battery if needed, and you can get a suitable replacement.\n\nThe only caveats are that the second M.2 slot is only a 2230-sized one, limiting it to an additional 1TB based on current capacities. According to Asus, the maximum memory modules that this machine will accept are 32GB, resulting in a total of 64 GB.\n\nActually, since the maximum memory addressed by the processor is 256GB, I suspect that it might accept 48GB modules and end up with 96GB, but I’ve not tested that theory. When 64GB modules become widely available, it might be possible to squeeze 128GB into here.\n\nThere is a twist with the memory that I’ll cover in the next section.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nHardware: 4 / 5\n\nAsus ExpertBook P3: Performance\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Laptops Header Cell - Column 1 Asus Expertbook P3 Asus Expertbook P3 (dual memory) CPU Row 0 - Cell 1 AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 Cores/Threads Row 1 - Cell 1 8C 16T 8C 16T TPD Row 2 - Cell 1 15-54W (28W) 15-54W (28W) RAM Row 3 - Cell 1 32GB DDR5-5600 (1x32GB) 32GB DDR5-5600 (2x16GB) SSD Row 4 - Cell 1 1TB Micron 2500 MTFDKBA1T0QGN 1TB Micron 2500 MTFDKBA1T0QGN Graphics Row 5 - Cell 1 AMD Radeon 860M AMD Radeon 860M NPU Row 6 - Cell 1 AMD Ryzen AI (50 TOPS) AMD Ryzen AI (50 TOPS) 3DMark WildLife 10,234 15,582 Row 8 - Cell 0 FireStrike 4061 6107 Row 9 - Cell 0 TimeSpy 1959 2882 Row 10 - Cell 0 Steel Nomad.L 1534 2262 CineBench24 Single 117 116 Row 12 - Cell 0 Multi 761 909 Row 13 - Cell 0 Ratio 6.91 7.83 GeekBench 6 Single 2879 2886 Row 15 - Cell 0 Multi 11529 13560 Row 16 - Cell 0 OpenCL 22785 24370 Row 17 - Cell 0 Vulkan 26293 33104 CrystalDIsk Read MB/s 6986 7006 Row 19 - Cell 0 Write MB/s 6104 6111 PCMark 10 Office 7459 7763 Row 21 - Cell 0 Battery 18h 31m 18h 17m Battery Whr 70 70 WEI Score 8.1 8.1\n\nUsually, I like to compare one laptop with another to show how making one choice over another has implications for performance.\n\nBizarrely, in this performance analysis, I’ve compared the Asus Expertbook P3 with itself, with one seemingly small difference that ends up having huge implications.\n\nWhen I received this laptop, I was in the middle of reviewing a machine with the PRO version of the same CPU, and therefore had benchmark data to explore that minor upgrade.\n\nBut it soon became clear that the P3 performed badly, and the difference was so much that something was clearly wrong. Days later, I eventually discovered what was holding the P3 back: the inclusion of a single DDR5 module in the review machine, and not two modules.\n\nIt’s worth noting that DDR5 was sold to the computer industry as being ideal because it has dual channels in a single module, and therefore, single memory modules were fine.\n\nAnd they are, but modern architectures like the one in this laptop can run four memory channels, two on each module, and that increases the amount of bandwidth significantly.\n\nBecause this system uses main memory not only for the CPU, but also for the GPU, the difference, as demonstrated by these results, is like night and day.\n\nWhat I did was remove the single Hynix module and replaced it with two Crucial SODIMMs of roughly the specification that I borrowed from a GMKtec mini PC. And, magically, some test results improved by 50%, disturbingly.\n\nI went back to Asus, keen to discover why a respected brand would do something like this, and their explanation revealed some bent logic that I’ve seen from other brands.\n\nIn the product specifications, there are four possible memory configurations that Asus offers, including two single configurations of 16GB and 32GB, and two dual configurations of 32GB (2x 16GB) and 64GB (2x 32GB).\n\nAccording to Asus, the single module versions are for those who want to upgrade, and they will have a slot free to put that extra module. That approach makes almost no sense. Because the Hynix module in there is an OEM part, and it’s unlikely that they will match that exact part, and without the upgrade, the machine will be massively underperforming.\n\nIf you order multiples of these machines, the best course of action would be to strip half the machines of their modules to upgrade the rest, and get matching pairs for those machines.\n\nBut the best solution is not to buy any of the single-module machines in the first place. If you want 32GB of RAM then get the dual 16GB machine, not the single 32GB one.\n\nWhen you do have dual modules, this machine performs well, which is why it got the score I gave it, and it’s also excellent on power efficiency. But beware system makers providing options that significantly degrade the performance of their hardware, which are marketed as being for your convenience.\n\n(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)\n\nPerformance: 4 / 5\n\nAsus ExpertBook P3: Final verdict\n\nOn the face of it, a great laptop, until I realised that Asus had flushed 50% of its performance away by making a silly decision on memory modules. That point aside, this is a nice system with more ports than many laptops get these days, and an excellent Ryzen platform.\n\nThere are a few areas where this machine could be improved, opening up the option for a P3 Plus model with a 2.5GbE LAN port and the USB4 ports that the processor natively supports.\n\nBut for the relatively low asking price, for the majority of office users, this machine is excellent, if you don’t make the horrible mistake of buying one with a single memory module.\n\nShould you buy a Asus ExpertBook P3?\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Value A powerful system for a modest price 4 / 5 Design Thin and lightweight, with plenty of ports 4 / 5 Hardware AI 300 series CPU with NPU power for local models 4 / 5 Performance Great performance, once you have two memory modules 4 / 5 Overall If you avoid the memory pitfall, this is a decent system 4 / 5\n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou are on a tight budget\n\nFor the money, this is a decent laptop with plenty of nice features and a good hardware platform. Cheaper machines than this will be rehashing old processors and memory technologies.\n\nYou like upgrades\n\nLots of bits on this machine can easily be upgraded, including the memory and storage. However, it isn't the easiest laptop to remove the underside.\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou need Thunderbolt or USB4\n\nThe best USB port on this machine is only USB 3.2 Gen 2, and while it can transfer a file at 1,000MB/s, it pales in comparison to USB4 or Thunderbolt performance. If you want Thunderbolt, then you will need something better than this.\n\nYou need more than 3TB\n\nThe maximum SSD sizes on this system are one 2TB and a 1TB, though you might be able to get a 4TB module to work in the one 2280 M.2 slot. But without a heatsink, you need to make sure it doesn't overheat.\n\nIf you want more storage, find a machine with two 2280 slots, and not this one with a 2280 and a 2230.\n\nFor more professional devices, we reviewed the best laptops for work and gaming and the best laptops for working from home.",

      "headline": "Trump’s tariff‑shaped stick can’t beat reality on US chip fabbing",
      "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

      "headline": "Linux Kernel 6.17 Released, This is What’s New",
      "content": "EXT4 filesystem boosts – and changes to help SSDs last longer\n\nLinus Torvalds has announced the release of Linux kernel 6.17, an update that brings improved hardware support and a number of core system improvements.\n\nThe new kernel provides graphic drivers for the latest Intel ‘Panther Lake’ laptops, better power management features for devices with AMD hybrid GPUs, resolves a software bug that’s been knocking around since 1993, and helps SSDs last longer.\n\nAnnouncing the release on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), Linus Torvalds says: “No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go.”\n\nUbuntu 25.10 ships wit the new kernel, including in the beta build that was released last week. Users on the current long-term support release, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, will receive kernel 6.17 as part of the next hardware enablement (HWE) update in early 2026.\n\nIs this kernel a solid upgrade? You know it is! For a whip through the new features in Linux 6.17 which caught my eye, read on.\n\nLinux 6.17: What’s New?\n\nGraphics & Gaming\n\nAlienware’s ‘boost’ key (top row) gets a standardised keycode\n\nThe first Core Ultra Series 3 laptops powered by Intel ‘Panther Lake’ chips are due to go on sale soon, so it’s timely that Intel Xe3 integrated graphics are enabled by default in Linux 6.17. This ensures anyone bagging a new model and installing Ubuntu 25.10 gets solid graphics performance off the bat.\n\nSmartMux in 6.17 will switch between integrated and discrete graphics on AMD laptops\n\nFor those using laptops equipped with Core Ultra Series 2 (‘Lunar Lake’) chips, the Intel IPU7 driver has proper web camera support. Ideal for online meetings, social chats and accidental jump-scares when launching the camera app by accident.\n\nAMD hybrid GPU laptops gain SmartMux support with Linux 6.17. This auto-switches between integrated and discrete graphics based on workload to (obviously) save power or deliver maximum performance if needed.\n\nLenovo WMI Gaming Series Drivers add support for both Legion Go and the SteamOS-powered Legion Go S handheld, which will be especially handy for those looking to run other kinds of Linux-based operating systems on the AMD-powered handheld.\n\nThe kernel also standardises the keycode used by the (mysterious) “performance boost” key on newer Dell and Alienware laptops, and the (rather frutiger aero-looking) Flydigi Apex 5 game controller now has proper support on Linux — nice!\n\nOn a tangentially gaming-related note, the networking stack adds DualPI2 congestion control support. This helps to reduce network queue latency, which should prove beneficial for online gaming, streaming, video calls, and other real-time applications.\n\nFilesystem changes\n\nKernel write changes may help SSDs last longer\n\nThere are many filesystems improvements in 6.17 that will be directly appreciable by those of us running a desktop Linux distribution (not just the one this site is named after, either).\n\nUbuntu’s default file system is EXT4, and Linux 6.17 sees major performance boosts\n\nPerhaps most significant: the kernel can now write zeroes efficiently without actual I/O operations on NVMe SSDs that support the DEAC bit, and SCSI SSDs which support the UMMAP bit (a ‘bit’ is a kind of indicator of a feature state).\n\nThe FALLOC_FL_WRITE_ZEROES option for fallocate() will mark storage regions as zero-filled internally on modern SSDs. This will improve performance and reduce wear (SSDs theoretically have finite read/write lifespans, so fewer writes = lasts longer).\n\nUbuntu’s default filesystem EXT4 improves block allocation scalability. Per benchmarks, this provides noticeable performance benefits under I/O heavy tasks like querying databases or copying large numbers of files.\n\nBtrfs adds experimental large-folio support, which reduces memory management overhead when handling large files. This, combined with compression control during defragmentation, makes Btrfs better suited to performance-sensitive workloads.\n\nEROFS supports metadata compression and faster directory reading, which should prove especially handy on systems with read-only root filesystems or in container-heavy workloads. There’s no Bcachefs in the 6.17 merge reports…\n\nLaptop Support\n\nMacBook Pro touchbar becoming ever-more-functional in Linux\n\nLinux support on M1 and M2 Macs continues to improve in Linux 6.17, with the Apple Silicon SMC driver enabling ‘proper’ rebooting of M1 and M2 Macs. With work to run Linux on M3 and M4 Macs in limbo, it’s nice earlier gens are improving their mainline support.\n\nThe Touch Bar on Intel-based MacBook Pros see further improvements in Linux 6.17 with patches to enable touch screen input, albeit with a few lingering quirks. Apple ends support for Intel-based Macs after macOS 26, so Linux will give those devices a new lease of life.\n\nElsewhere, Linux 6.17 brings mainline support for ASUS Zenbook A14 Snapdragon X1 Plus/Elite laptops, allowing more Linux distributions to run on these ARM-based Windows devices. There’s also mainline support for Raspberry Pi 5’s RP1 I/O chip.\n\nGot a keyboard with F13-F24 keys? Those are now properly mapped in Linux 6.17\n\nSupport for Corsair HX1200i PSU monitoring (2025 model) is present; wake-on-touch support added to the Intel Touch Host Controller (along with overlay objects support, great for tablet and 2-in-1 users); and kernel mapping for F13 – F24 keys on PS/2 keyboards.\n\nYes, keyboards with an addition 12 function keys actually exist!\n\nHD Audio support is extended to cover the Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300, commercial ASUS laptops using CS35L41 HDA, and HP EliteBook models. USB audio offloading (a feature in Linux 6.xx) covers more mobile devices, including Fairphone 4.\n\nCore kernel changes\n\nNew Attack Vector Controls have been integrated to simplify security handling for known CPU vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown. Previously, each mitigation had its own kernel command-line option. In 6.17, there’s a unified option.\n\nMaking it easier for Linux server admins (and others) to disable unneeded protections may help them claw back performance dips certain mitigations require as well make it easier to manage the growing number of hardware vulnerability bandaids.\n\nSupport for uniprocessor configuration has been removed from the kernel scheduler. Every machine, even those which run on a single-core processor will now ‘unconditionally’ run a kernel designed for multicore systems.\n\nThis shouldn’t lead to any detrimental impact on single-core systems (not that many folks likely run one full-time in 2025), but adopting a unified scheduling approach across all CPUs should reduce code and make kernel behaviour more reliable.\n\nSpeed Boosts?\n\nLinux 6.17 picks up initial proxy execution support. This new kernel feature may speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when a high-priority application is waiting for a resource, the system temporarily gives the resource holder a boost, causing it to finish and release the resource faster.\n\nA new kernel feature could speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when high-priority tasks are waiting for a resource\n\nOr to word it the way kernel devs would, this resolves “priority-inversion problems” by enabling “high-priority tasks waiting for locks to donate execution context to lock holders”, which reduces latency spikes — slowdowns — in desktop apps.\n\nMemory management sees various optimisations across the kernel subsystems, notable with improved futex performance for heavily threaded applications (and more reliable crash kernel handling for debugging when things go wrong).\n\nAMD’s Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI) was added. Modern processors mix two types of cores: performance and efficiency. On AMD, HFI gives the kernel info to help it decide which core is better suited to which tasks, improving performance and power management.\n\nWeird Stuff\n\nLinux 6.17 removes the Pktcdvd packet-writing optical driver. It was deprecated in 2016, survived a removal attempt in 2023, but now, in 2025 optical packet-writing is definitively done and dusted! A loss for those who liked it, but a curio for those who’d never heard of it…\n\nThere’s also a bug fix for a kernel limitation dating back to 1993. It’s related to ELF program header handling that causes some applications in certain conditions to bug out. After 30 years, someone has finally bothered to fix it properly.\n\nOther Changes:\n\nBeyond the highlights above, some other notable changes in Linux 6.17:\n\nBPF subsystem adds standard string operations\n\nBPF programs have output and error streams for userspace communication\n\nExtended attributes support for pidfds\n\nNew DAMON_STAT kernel module for simplified memory activity monitoring\n\nTCP stack now enforces receive window limits more strictly\n\nASoC adds AMD ACP7.2 platform support\n\nKernel live patch support on 64-bit ARM\n\nTurbostat utility gains L3 cache topology display\n\nFor more detail on the release as whole read through the comprehensive merge report recaps (first half & second half) put out by the folks at LWN, or sift through the thousands of kernel commits on GitHub (grab a coffee before doing that, eh).\n\nUpgrade to Linux 6.17\n\nLinux 6.17 is available for download from kernel.org as source, but you will need to compile that source code by hand to make use of it — not for the faint of heart!\n\nUbuntu 25.10 includes Linux 6.17 by default, and the release will be back-ported to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS users in early 2026.\n\nIt will not be packaged for and uploaded to Ubuntu repositories for other supported releases officially, but it is possible to make use of Canonical Mainline DEBs or third-party PPAs unofficially — not without caveats, however.\n\nInstalling newer Linux kernels on Ubuntu from outside of the main repos comes with no guarantees and no support. They may lack Ubuntu-specific patches and drivers, not work in with some hardware or lack feature integrations.",

      "headline": "Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI investment raises eyebrows and a key question: How much of the AI boom is just Nvidia’s cash being recycled?",
      "content": "Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently. The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back.\n\nIn addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.\n\nThe extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.\n\nIn past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.\n\nNvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.\n\n繼續閱讀\n\nStartups financing data centers have often had to borrow money at rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% that a large, established corporation such as Microsoft might have to pay. With Nvidia’s backing, OpenAI and Coreweave have been able to borrow at rates closer to what Microsoft or Google might pay.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also signed a $6.3 billion deal to purchase any cloud capacity that CoreWeave can’t sell to others. The chipmaker had previously agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years on cloud computing with CoreWeave. Coreweave, meanwhile, has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs so far—the majority of which it says are H100 Hopper models, which cost about $30,000 each—which means Coreweave has spent about $7.5 billion buying these chips from Nvidia. So in essence, all of the money Nvidia has invested in Coreweave has come back to it in the form of revenue.\n\n\n\nNvidia has struck similar cloud computing deals with other so-called “neo-cloud” companies. According to a story in The Information, Nvidia agreed this summer to spend $1.3 billion over four years renting some 10,000 of its own AI chips from Lambda, which like Coreweave runs data centers, as well as a separate $200 million deal to rent some 8,000 more over an unspecified time period.\n\nFor those who believe there’s an AI bubble, the Lambda deal is clear evidence of froth. Those Nvidia chips Lambda is renting time on back to Nvidia? It bought them with borrowed money collateralized by the value of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\n\nBesides its large investments in OpenAI and Coreweave, AI chipmaker also holds multi-million dollar stakes in several other publicly-traded companies that either purchase its GPUs or work on related chip technology. These include chip design firm Arm, high-performance computing company Applied Digital, cloud services company Nebius Group, and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals. (Nvidia also recently purchased a 4% stake in Intel for $5 billion. Like Arm, Intel makes chips that in some cases are alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, but which for the most part are complementary to them.)\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia also pledged to invest £2 billion ($2.7 billion) in U.K. AI startups, including at least £500 million in Nscale, a U.K.-based data center operator that will, presumably, be using some of that money to purchase Nvidia GPUs to provision the data centers it is building. Nvidia also said it would invest in a number of British startups, both directly and through local venture capital firms, and some of that money too, will likely come back to OpenAI in the form of computing purchases, either directly, or through cloud service providers, who in turn will need to buy Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia invested about $1 billion in AI startups globally either directly or through its corporate venture capital arm NVentures, according to data from Dealroom and The Financial Times. This amount was up significantly from what Nvidia invested in 2022, the year the generative AI boom kicked off with OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nHow much of this money winds up coming right back to Nvidia in the form of sales is again, difficult to determine. Wall Street research firm NewStreet Research has estimated that for every $10 billion Nvidia invests in OpenAI, it will see $35 billion worth of GPU purchases or GPU lease payments, an amount equal to about 27% of its annual revenues last fiscal year.\n\nEchoes of the dotcom era\n\nThat kind of return would certainly make this sort of customer financing worthwhile. But it does raise concerns among analysts about a bubble in AI valuations. These kinds of circular deals have been a hallmark of previous technology bubbles and have often come back to haunt investors.\n\nIn this case, the lease arrangements that Nvidia is entering into with OpenAI as part of its latest investment could prove problematic. By leasing GPUs to OpenAI, rather than requiring them to buy the chips outright, Nvidia is sparing OpenAI from having to take an accounting charge for the high depreciation rates on the chips, which will ultimately help OpenAI’s bottom line. But it means that instead Nvidia will have to bear this depreciation costs. What’s more, Nvidia will also take on the risk of being stuck with an inventory of GPUs no one wants if demand for AI workloads don’t match Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rosy predictions.\n\n\n\nTo some market watchers, Nvidia’s latest deals feel all-too-similar to the excesses of past technology booms. During the dot com bubble at the turn of the 21st Century, telecom equipment makers such as Nortel, Lucent, and Cisco lent money to startups and telecom companies to purchase their equipment. Just before the bubble burst in 2001, the amount of financing Cisco and Nortel had extended to their customers exceeded 10% of annual revenues, and the amount of financing the top five telecom equipment makers had provided to customers exceeded 123% of their combined earnings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the amount of fiber-optic cabling and switching equipment installed far exceeded demand, and when the bubble burst and many of those customers went bust, the telecom equipment makers were left holding the bad debt on their balance sheets. This contributed to a greater loss of value when the bubble burst than would have otherwise been the case, with networking equipment businesses losing more than 90% of their value over the ensuing decade.\n\n\n\nWorse yet were companies such as fiber-optic giant Global Crossing that engaged in direct “revenue roundtripping.” These companies cut deals—often at the end of a quarter in order to hit topline forecasts—in which they paid money to another company for services, and then that company agreed to purchase equipment of exactly equal value. When the bubble burst, Global Crossing went bankrupt, and its executives ultimately paid large legal settlements related to revenue roundtripping.\n\n\n\nIt is memories of these kinds of transactions that have caused analysts to at least raise an eyebrow at some of Nvidia’s circular investments. Goldberg, the Seaport Global analyst, said the deals had a whiff of circular financing and were emblematic of “bubble-like behavior.”\n\n“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note following Nvidia’s announcement of its blockbuster investment in OpenAI. It’s a long way from a concern to a crisis, of course, but as AI company valuations get higher, that distance is starting to close.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "headline": "Actual ports and NVIDIA GPUs make this laptop the practical Dell XPS and MacBook Pro alternative",
      "content": "The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i is the premium, feature-packed 16-inch powerhouse for those who need to work, create, and even game on the go. It's an excellent, incredibly practical laptop that feels like the more reasonable alternative to the divisive Dell 16 Premium (previously the Dell XPS 16). I only wish battery life was better, but I can't say I'm shocked it's not.\n\nWhy you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nCreators, engineers, and other professionals the world over rely on powerful 16-inch laptops to keep them working smoothly, even while staying mobile. The Dell XPS 16 (now the Dell 16 Premium), the Apple MacBook Pro 16, the Razer Blade 16 — these are all great choices, but there's another excellent alternative on the block.\n\nThis is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition... which is a ridiculously long name for an incredibly capable laptop with a practical design, potent performance, and an impressive set of features that make it well-suited to almost any task.\n\nIt's also well priced compared to the aforementioned competition, making it one of the easiest to recommend. While other laptops often focus on sleek and minimalist designs (often at the expense of features or practicality), the Yoga Pro 9i doesn't cut any corners — or ports.\n\nDisclaimer This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. Lenovo had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.\n\nMy Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) review\n\nImage 1 of 4 The clean Lenovo logo and \"communications bar\" are in full display with this laptop. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Most people would be content with just the ports on one side. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) I'd prefer swapping one of those Type-A ports for a Thunderbolt 4 port on the other side, but this is a great I/O selection either way. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) These aren't the slimmest bezels on the block, but the Yoga Pro 9i still feels plenty premium. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDesign ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWhere the Dell 16 Premium (2025) we recently reviewed boasts a controversial, futuristic, and minimalist design, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i absolutely prioritizes function over form.\n\nIt's a familiar two-tier Lenovo design with a rounded base and squared-off lid, creating a unique profile entirely constructed of high-quality aluminum. The Yoga Pro 9i isn't the most refined high-end laptop I've held in my hand and doesn't feature the slimmest display bezel, but it absolutely looks and feels like a premium product.\n\nYou can immediately tell the Yoga Pro 9i is a truly premium laptop, even if it's not the most futuristic design.\n\nAt around 17.9mm thick and 1.93kg heavy, there are certainly beefier 16-inch workstations, but the Yoga Pro 9i's design does make it seem chunkier than it actually is.\n\nAt least you get a ton of ports. There's the 170W DC power port, an HDMI 2.1 port, two full-featured Thunderbolt 4 ports with Power Delivery and DisplayPort functions, a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB Type-A (5GBps) ports, a side-mounted power button, a webcam privacy shutter, and even a full-sized SD card slot. The only things missing are an Ethernet port (Lenovo would've had to make this laptop a fair bit thicker for that) and a Kensington Nano Security Slot, which may actually disappoint some professional users.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDisplay ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nLenovo actually offers two OLED, touchscreen PureSight Pro display options for the Yoga Pro 9i. Both panels boast a 120Hz refresh rate, excellent color accuracy across standard and cinematic gamuts, Dolby Vision HDR and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 1000 support, and the trifecta of TÜV Rheindland Low Blue Light, TÜV Rheinland Flicker-Free, and Eyesafe certifications.\n\nFor an extra $150, though, you can upgrade to a Tandem OLED display with a higher 3.2K resolution (up from 2.8K), even greater color accuracy (especially in the AdobeRGB gamut), twice the display brightness at up to 1,000 nits (compared to 500 nits, and that's not even with HDR enabled), and greater efficiency to boot. Sadly, Lenovo didn't send me that configuration to test, so I can't tell you just how much better that panel is.\n\nThe entry-level screen is still fantastic, though. It's bright, vibrant, and responsive whether I was working, editing photos, gaming, or watching videos. If the Tandem OLED display is even better, it'll be one of the best panels you'll find on a laptop right now.\n\nPerformance ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, a 16-core CPU with fantastic overall performance and solid efficiency. That's backed by up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 (8GB) GPU, but Lenovo sent me the entry-level configuration with an RTX 5050 inside — and it seriously impressed me.\n\nThis laptop is a strong performer in general, backed by Intel Evo guarantees for responsiveness and bolstered by excellent thermal management. The Yoga Pro 9i never got too warm, never suffered from abnormal throttling, and kept quiet enough even under load.\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i was practically guaranteed to deliver great performance, but it still managed to surprise me.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, it's the RTX 5050 that surprised me. Lenovo actually offers a GPU overclocking option, and when enabled the Yoga Pro 9i's RTX 5050 performed well beyond the level I expected, coming within a stone's throw of the far more expensive Dell 16 Premium's RTX 5070 without becoming thermally restrained.\n\nI was able to play Forza Horizon 5 with Extreme settings without any issues, either, never dipping below a stable 60 FPS.\n\nImage 1 of 3 I really like this keyboard, but I'm still not a fan of Lenovo's next key coating. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) There's a lot of power packed into this chassis, but you don't feel it most of the time. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Intel Evo, NVIDIA Studio — this laptop has all the ingredients it needs to tackle any workflow or task. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nBattery life ⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWith an 84Whr battery stashed away inside, the Yoga Pro 9i certainly has plenty of juice... but it's not enough to translate to true all-day battery life. In my testing, the Yoga Pro 9i can deliver around 5 hours of real-time usage — slightly better than the Dell 16 Premium and its larger 99Whr battery, but nothing too impressive.\n\nYou can use up to 100W USB Type-C chargers whenever you're in a pinch, at least. Performance when off the charger is throttled, but is still absolutely what I'd consider \"flagship\" level — especially the graphical oomph.\n\nThis laptop can't claim to boast the greatest endurance, but it's no worse than much of the competition.\n\nKeyboard & touchpad ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI've historically been a huge fan of Lenovo's keyboards, and that still mostly holds true with the Yoga Pro 9i. The layout, key travel, and consistency are all top-notch, and the keyboard doesn't feel too cramped despite having a compact tenkey number pad off to one side (a feature some will love, and others will hate).\n\nAs I noted in my Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i (Gen 9) Aura Edition review, though, the new coating Lenovo puts on its keys isn't my favorite. This is a good keyboard, it's just slippery.\n\nThe touchpad is spacious and responsive with Microsoft Precision drivers, so I have little to complain about there... but I do wish Lenovo would finally embrace haptic touchpads on its premium consumer laptops.\n\nLenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding doesn't mean anything to 99% of people... this laptop still delivers a great software experience, though. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nSoftware & AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i runs Windows 11, and it does so without issue. Drivers are stable and Lenovo hasn't injected an absurd amount of bloatware onto the device.\n\nLenovo didn't pour every feature imaginable into the Yoga Pro 9i, it just focused on delivering a capable, high-quality laptop.\n\nYou also get some extra features courtesy of Lenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding, such as multi-device syncing for photos and files, \"smart\" performance and settings profiles, and Lenovo's \"AI Now\" companion, but the Yoga Pro 9i is not a Copilot+ PC thanks to the weaker NPU of its processor, so it doesn't boast all the latest and greatest artificial intelligence features in Windows.\n\nThat won't make a difference to most people, but it's worth noting this laptop technically isn't on the cutting edge for software.\n\nEverything else ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe display isn't the only reason the Yoga Pro 9i is a monster for entertainment, as it also packs a capable six-speaker system (dual 2W tweeters and quad 2W woofers) with Dolby Atmos support.\n\nI won't go as far as claiming these are the best-sounding speakers in a laptop I've heard, but the Yoga Pro 9i does sound full, loud, and clear. You also get a quad microphone array flanking the great 5MP front-facing camera, which is supported by an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition.\n\nI never had any issues with the Wi-Fi 7 or Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, either. The Yoga Pro 9i doesn't rock any additional features like Human Presence Detection (HPD) or ambient light sensors, or a fingerprint reader, but the basics are covered and they're covered well.\n\nYoga Pro 9i (Gen 10) review: My final thoughts\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i isn't one of the most exciting laptops of 2025, but it is one of my favorites. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\n✅You should buy this if ...\n\nYou need a powerful, feature-packed 16-inch laptop for work and creation.\n\nYou also want that laptop to be good for PC gaming, too.\n\nYou want a laptop with a top-notch OLED display and speaker system.\n\n❌You should not buy this if ...\n\nYou actually care about Windows 11's Copilot+ PC-exclusive features.\n\nYou need a laptop with consistent, easy all-day battery life.\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition may have a slightly ridiculous name, but it's hands-down one of the greatest laptops in the category of \"powerful and premium 16-inch workstations.\"\n\nWhile Apple commits to minimalism and Dell pushes even more aggressively in that direction, Lenovo is delivering an equally capable laptop packed with features and ports — all while undercutting the competition on price. It's a shockingly practical laptop for productivity, creation, entertainment, and gaming.\n\nWhile I do wish the battery could withstand a full day's worth of work without compromise, that doesn't stop this from being one of the best Windows laptops I've tested this year. You can customize your own Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition from $1,869.99 at Lenovo.com, or pull the trigger on the configuration I most recommend for $2,149.99 at Lenovo.com, which upgrades you to that sweet Tandem OLED display and a more powerful RTX 5060 GPU.",

In turn it's been observed that FS-VERITY performance improves nicely across many Intel/AMD x86_64 and AArch64 processors. Eric Biggers reported in the patch that it's roughly 35% faster performance.\n\nAlso sent in was the FSCRYPT pull request for Linux 6.18. The focus there is on using HMAC-SHA512 library functions rather than going through crypto_shash. In turn FSCRYPT should enjoy this simpler and faster and more reliable code path.Lastly there was a pull request sent out on Saturday for crypto library updates . This pull brings RISC-V optimized code for Poly1305, simplifies other code, and always enabling architecture-optimized BLAKE2s code.",

      "headline": "RUMOR: SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY Will See The Punisher In Direct Conflict With The Villainous [SPOILER]",
      "content": "Spider-Man: Brand New Day is going to see Peter Parker face perhaps his greatest challenge yet. No longer an Avenger, the street-level superhero will have to contend with fellow \"hero\" The Punisher's war on crime, and new threats in The Scorpion and Tombstone.\n\nThe Hulk is also expected to enter the fray, while recent rumours have pointed to the supernatural Shathra being the movie's big bad.\n\nMinor plot details have come our way in dribs and drabs in recent weeks, with the latest shared by scooper Daniel Richtman. He claims that, in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, \"[The] Punisher and Tombstone will be in direct conflict.\"\n\nIf The Punisher has set his sights on him, then this points to Tombstone being a major threat in the movie. Assuming Mayor Wilson Fisk is defeated and imprisoned in Daredevil: Born Again season 2, then it's likely that the power vacuum in New York will lead to a Gang War that Spider-Man and Frank Castle attempt to put an end to.\n\nThis may also go some way in explaining what leads Frank to seemingly go to war with Ma Gnucci in the upcoming Punisher Special Presentation.\n\nRecent set photos have confirmed that the Department of Damage Control will appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, following appearances in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Ms. Marvel.\n\nHowever, before this movie is released, insider @MyTimeToShineH says we'll see the government organisation play a \"huge role\" in December's Wonder Man TV series.\n\nWe're not shocked to learn there's a connection between that and Spider-Man: Brand New Day because filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton has obviously worked on both projects.\n\nRecently, Marvel's Head of Streaming, Television, and Animation, Brad Winderbaum, said, \"Wonder Man is eight episodes. It's a very new flavor for Marvel. It's straight from the minds of Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Guest. Honestly, it is one of my favorite things ever.\"\n\n\"I think it's the best show no one's ever seen, and I’m very excited to see the audience reaction to it,\" the executive teased. \"I think it's a love letter to what we do as filmmakers. It's a love letter to acting as a profession, and it's a very sincere, beautiful show.\"\n\nAs always, let us know your thoughts on these MCU rumours down in the comments section.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day shares a title with a divisive era of storytelling, which, thanks to a deal with Mephisto, saw the wall-crawler get a fresh start when his marriage to Mary Jane Watson ended and his identity became secret again. He faced many new sinister foes during that time and was surrounded by an overhauled supporting cast, including Mister Negative, Jackpot, Menace, and Carlie Cooper.\n\nInstead, all signs point to Spidey teaming up with (and at some point fighting) The Punisher to take on a Savage Hulk, with The Scorpion thrown in for good measure.\n\nSeveral other villains are reportedly set to appear in the movie, including Tombstone, Tarantula, Boomerang, and Ramrod. There's been some chatter online about the Venom Symbiote factoring into the story, potentially setting the stage for Mac Gargan to eventually don the alien costume.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings helmer Destin Daniel Cretton directs Spider-Man: Brand New Day from a script by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland leads a cast that also includes Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, Zendaya, Sadie Sink, Michael Mando, Tramell Tillman, Marvin Jones III, and Liza Colón-Zayas. Thunderbolts* star Florence Pugh has also joined the cast.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day will be released in theaters on July 31, 2026.",

      "content": "In the early 1980s, there was the IBM PC, with its 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 processor. It was an unexpected hit for the company, and within a few years there were a host of competitors. Every self-respecting technology corporation wanted a piece of the action including processor manufacturers, and among those was NEC with their V20 chip and its V30 sibling. From the outside they were faster pin-compatible 8088 and 8086 clones, but internally they could also run both 8080 and 80186 code. [The Silicon Underground] has a look back at the V20, with some technical details, history, and its place as a PC upgrade.\n\nFor such a capable part it’s always been a surprise here that it didn’t take the world by storm, and the article sheds some light on this in the form of an Intel lawsuit that denied it a critical early market access. By the time it was available in quantity the PC world had moved on from the 8088, so we saw it in relatively few machines. It was a popular upgrade for those in the know back in the day though as it remains in 2025, and aside from its immediate speed boost there are a few tricks it lends to a classic PC clone. The version of DOS that underpinned Windows 95 won’t run on an 8086 or 8088 because it contains 8016 instructions, but a V20 can run it resulting in a much faster DOS experience. One to remember, if an early PC or clone cones your way.\n\nHungry for the good old days of DOS? You don’t need to find 80s hardware for that.",

(Image credit: Xbox Game Studios / Windows Central) The list of Windows Central quizzes continues to grow. You might know your stuff when it comes to Call of Duty: Black Ops, but how will you fare against our other tests?\n\nBlack Ops is a series that has introduced drastic changes to the Call of Duty franchise over the years. In an era when many shooters embraced the brown and gray aesthetic, Black Ops dared to be a little brighter, featuring maps with bolder color palettes that are still among some of the best playgrounds even today.\n\nFrom the Siege of Stalingrad to Project Blackout, Black Ops’ history has taken us on mind-bending adventures across the annals of history that forge a twisted path to a future beyond imagination. And yet, Treyarch leadership says that Black Ops 7 will not bring the series to a close.\n\n“It can’t be [the end] for us because we have so much love for our other games,” answered Yale Miller, Treyarch’s director of production, “Like Black Ops 3 is canon, right? There are still things that are there [to explore].”\n\nWhile Black Ops’ deep lore and extensive campaigns provide plenty of fodder for future titles, so does its much-loved Zombies mode. Effectively a game-within-a-game, Zombies has grown into a beast of its own with its own canon story lines, unique cast, and nightmarish undead foes.\n\nTake our quiz below and test your Call of Duty: Black Ops knowledge:\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set to launch on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation on November 14. The next mainline title in the 20+ year old franchise is expected to be stacked with an all-new cooperative campaign and endgame. You can also look forward to classic multiplayer with a slightly more futuristic twist, and the next chapter in the Dark Aether storyline for its famed Zombies mode.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

Impact Link\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAn executive order signed by President Donald Trump late Friday, hiking H-1B visa application fees to $100,000, sent Silicon Valley into a tailspin.\n\nH-1B visas have become a mainstay of the tech industry, allowing companies to hire highly-skilled workers from abroad, including engineers.\n\nAffected tech workers and corporate lawyers initially scrambled to decipher the new policies, with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta telling employees on H-1B visas to either stay in the US or return from abroad within 24 hours.\n\nThe Trump administration subsequently clarified that the fees would only apply to new applicants, not renewals or current H-1B holders.\n\nThe Trump administration said it implemented the changes to prevent system \"abuses\" and to encourage companies to train American workers.\n\nSome applauded the new policy, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings, who said it could mean the end of the lottery system, given H-1Bs are capped at 85,000 workers annually. Others worried cash-strapped startups would be most severely affected, or that the executive order could counterintuitively push more jobs out of the country.\n\nBusiness Insider examined publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to track which tech companies had the most H-1B visa approvals in 2025.\n\nBloomberg, Intel, and Nvidia declined to comment.

      "content": "What do you do when you find a ISA Sound Blaster 2.0 card in a pile of scrap? Try to repair the damage on it to give it a second shot at life, of course. This is what [Adrian Black] did with one hapless victim, with the card in question being mostly in good condition minus an IC that had been rather rudely removed. The core Creative CT1336A and Yamaha YM3812 ICs were still in place, so the task was to figure out what IC was missing, find a replacement and install it.\n\nThe CT1350 is the final revision of the original 8-bit ISA Sound Blaster card, with a number of upgrades that makes this actually quite a desirable soundcard. The CT1350B revision featured here on a card from 1994 was the last to retain compatibility with the C/MS chips featured on the original SB card. After consulting with [Alex] from the Bits und Bolts YT channel, it was found that not only is the missing IC merely an Intel 8051-based Atmel MCU, but replacements are readily available. After [Alex] sent him a few replacements with two versions of the firmware preflashed, all [Adrian] had to do was install one.\n\nBefore installation, [Adrian] tested the card to see whether the expected remaining functionality like the basic OPL2 soundchip worked, which was the case. Installing the new MCU got somewhat hairy as multiple damaged pads and traces were discovered, probably because the old chip was violently removed. Along the way of figuring out how important these damaged pads are, a reverse-engineered schematic of the card was discovered, which was super helpful.\n\nSome awkward soldering later, the card’s Sound Blaster functionality sprung back to life, after nudging the volume dial on the card up from zero. Clearly the missing MCU was the only major issue with the card, along with the missing IO bracket, for which a replacement was printed after the video was recorded.",

      "content": "Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.\n\nThis announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.\n\nWhile an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.\n\nStill, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.\n\nNevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.\n\nEven though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

For enhancing existing driver support, the AMD and Intel graphics drivers continue seeing a bulk of the activity. Plus ongoing Rust code work in the DRM subsystem and more.\n\nBelow is a look at the DRM kernel driver changes for Linux 6.18.- The \"Rocket\" accelerator driver is finally mainlined for enabling the NPU found on newer Rockchip SoCs. This is the open-source driver reverse-engineered and started by Tomeu Vizoso. The Rocket accel driver works with new user-space code in Mesa 25.3 for Rockchip NPUs.- The AMDGPU and AMDKFD Checkpoint and Resture \"CRIU\" support for GEM memory objects.- Expanded AMDGPU Video Core Next \"VCN\" engine reset support.- More AMD Cyan Skillfish updates.- The AMDXDNA accelerator driver now supports user-space allocated buffers, improved error reporting, and other enhancements.- A new Intel Xe driver interface for querying VMA count and memory attributes. The intel Intel SLPC \"power_profile\" sysfs interface for the Xe driver for power management tuning.- Intel Xe driver SR-IOV support for CCS surfaces on Xe2+. The SR-IOV PF mode is also now enabled by default on supported platforms. Intel has returned to working on the upstream Habana Labs accelerator driver . There still is no Gaudi 3 support but at least they are back to working on this code under a new set of maintainers.- Intel Xe driver support for madvise in GPU SVM (Shared Virtual Memory).- The Arm Mali Panthor DRM driver added support for Mali G710, G510, G310, Gx15, Gx20, Gx25 GPUs.- Continued work on Nova as the next-generation open-source NVIDIA Linux kernel driver written in Rust.- The initial code around Tyr as a new Rust driver for Arm Mali GPUs . It's not yet usable by end-users, similar to the Nova driver.- Various new Rust abstractions and other work toward making Rust DRM drivers more practical.See this pull for the full list of DRM feature patches this cycle.",

Google has been leading the work on haptic touchpads for Linux in motivated by their own Chrome OS needs.In addition to the haptic touchpad support, another Linux 6.18 HID addition worth noting is the Sony DualSense controller audio jack handling work.Some of the other HID changes include HID-BPF to be able to re-bind a driver to hid-multitouch, making hidraw ioctls safer, PIDFF improvements, and better configuration of Intel QuickI2C via ACPI.More details on these HID feature updates for Linux 6.18 via this merge",

      "content": "The app sorts receipts, screenshots, and handwritten notes automatically\n\nCopilot+ PCs are required for Microsoft’s newest Photos app functions\n\nAutomatic classification works even across different languages and scripts\n\nMicrosoft has released a new version of its Photos app, now presented as a more advanced tool for organizing and enhancing digital images.\n\nThe update, now live in the Microsoft Store, relies heavily on local artificial intelligence computation, with new functions tied specifically to Copilot+ PCs.\n\nThe app is not a dedicated photo editor, so it cannot be an Adobe Photoshop alternative. It instead focuses on sorting pictures, tagging documents, and upscaling low-resolution images with AI.\n\nAI-powered photo organization\n\nThe update brings automatic classification using an onboard neural processing unit to scan a library of pictures and sort them into categories such as screenshots, receipts, documents, and handwritten notes.\n\nThis system is meant to reduce the time spent scrolling through unstructured folders.\n\nMicrosoft also says the classification works across languages, so a receipt or document in another script should be tagged correctly.\n\nA “keyword” search option now allows users to quickly filter results, a function that might appeal to those who already store years of digital clutter inside their image folders.\n\nAre you a pro?

      "headline": "The age of silicon and software began 75 years ago with the patenting of the transistor",
      "content": "75 years ago, the three Bell Labs scientists behind the invention of the transistor would, at last, have the U.S. Patent in their hands. This insignificant-looking semiconductor device with three electrodes sparked the third industrial revolution. Moreover, it ushered in the age of silicon and software, which still dominates business and human society to this day.\n\nThe first working transistor was demonstrated in 1947, but it wasn’t until October 3, 1950, that the patent was secured by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. The patent was issued for a “three-electrode circuit element utilizing semiconductor materials.” It would take several more years before the significant impacts transistors would have on business and society were realized.\n\nTransistors replaced the bulky, fragile and power-hungry valves, that stubbornly remain present in some guitar amplifiers, audiophile sound systems, studio gear, where their ‘organic’ sound profile is sometime preferred. We also still see valves in some military, scientific, and microwave/RF applications, where transistors might be susceptible to radiation or other interference. There are other niche use cases.\n\nBeyond miniaturization, transistors would deliver dramatic boosts in - computational speed, energy efficiency, and reliability. Moreover, they became the foundation for integrated circuits and processors, where billions of transistors could operate reliably in a much smaller footprint than taken up by a single valve. Processors featuring a trillion transistors are now on the horizon.\n\n1947: invention, 1950: patent, 1965: Moore’s Law, 2025: billions of transistors per chip.\n\nFor PC enthusiasts, probably the best known piece of transistor lore comes from Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. Of course, we are talking about Moore’s Law, which was an observation by the pioneering American engineer. Moore’s most famous prediction was that “the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every two years with minimal rise in cost.” (Law was revised from one to two years in 1975).\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Intel) (Image credit: Intel) (Image credit: Intel)\n\nObviously, prior to 1965, when Moore’s Law was set out, the startling advance in transistor technology indicated that such an extrapolation would be reasonable. Even, now, certain semiconductor companies, engineers, and commentators reckon that Moore’s Law is still alive and well. You can see Intel's position in the slides, above.\n\nWhatever the case, it can’t be denied that since the patenting of the transistor, we have seen incredible miniaturization and advances in computing and software, expanding the possibilities of minds and machines. The current tech universe is actually buzzing with firms that reckon they can make machines with minds - artificial intelligence.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

      "headline": "Lenovo Legion Go 2 Review: A Handheld Made For Big, Meaty Claws",
      "content": "You buy Lenovo’s new Legion Go 2 handheld for the screen. The performance is secondary to how beautiful recent 2D titles look on the 8.8-inch, 1200p OLED display. The Legion Go 2 is otherwise a big, meaty handheld for gamers with big, meaty claws. You’ll struggle to hold it above your head lying in bed unless you’re a professional power lifter; the controls won’t be your favorite; it’s as wonky as its predecessor. And it’s hard to argue anybody should spend well over $1,000 on a gaming handheld rather than just buying a full gaming laptop.\n\nDespite all that, I can’t help but enjoy the hell out of it. My initial hours spent rolling my eyes at everything Lenovo failed to fix from its first iteration slowly morphed into the kind of appreciation that can only occur when a device starts to feel personal. It’s what happened when I downloaded Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades II to the device and had to hold back a gasp on a crowded plane for how gorgeous both games looked on Lenovo’s big, expensive, beautiful display.\n\nLegion Go 2 It's thick, heavy, and so damn pretty. It's a shame it costs as much as it does. 4 See at Best Buy Pros Beautiful OLED display\n\n144Hz refresh rate with VRR\n\nNew ergonomics\n\nLow-wattage performance uplift Cons Annoying removable controls\n\nFPS mode is pointless\n\nReflective display\n\nVery expensive at $1,350\n\nIt’s the same feeling I get from Valve’s $550 Steam Deck OLED, which uses the same organic light-emitting diode screen technology to present deeper contrast and rich colors. Valve’s handheld maxes out at 800p on an older, custom AMD chipset. Even when you factor in performance and display size, the Steam Deck OLED is still a much, much better deal. My review unit version of the Legion Go 2 with the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, costs $1,350. I could literally buy two Steam Decks for this price (more if I opted for the LCD model). For Lenovo’s inflated price, I could run out and buy three $450 Nintendo Switch 2 handhelds. You could nab a version of the Legion Go 2 that starts at $1,100 for a version with a AMD Ryzen Z2, but judging by my tests that chip will land closer in power to handhelds that are three years old and cost much less.\n\nIt’s a ridiculous scenario that consumers are taking the brunt of Donald Trump’s obsession with import taxes, aka tariffs. And in that way, consumers are screwed no matter what. The upcoming Asus ROG Xbox Ally X, which is set to launch on Oct. 16 with the same Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, will set you back $1,000. The original Legion Go asked for $700 in 2023. The Asus ROG Ally X demanded $800 at launch last year. Both now retail at a higher price, likely due to tariffs. I would tell you to wait and buy a new handheld, but there’s no way to tell if prices might increase in coming months.\n\nReally? You kept FPS mode?\n\nWhat drives me mad using the Legion Go 2 is how Lenovo held back from improving over the 2023 handheld. The revised version is far more ergonomic than the two-year-old device with its sharp corners. Both handhelds let you remove each controller and play with the screen separated, like the Nintendo Switch. The Switch 2 did away with rails and went for magnetic connections for each Joy-Con 2, which makes attaching and detaching the controllers a little easier. Lenovo’s old and new system still use a series of exposed pins you jam into a cavity on each side of the screen. You need two hands and a strong pitching arm to remove each controller with a down and out motion. Reattaching them can be just as annoying.\n\nSee Lenovo Legion Go 2 at Best Buy\n\nThe controller uses Hall effect sticks that are much better at surviving stick drift, though they still feel a little too thin on my fingers compared to other handhelds I’ve used. The Legion Go 2 has slightly redesigned bumper buttons that make it easier to press and the same, large triggers. The $650 Legion Go S had a switch to enable instant triggers with less travel—better for first-person shooter games, but because of the removable controllers you’ll have to stick with the full range of motion.\n\nThe Switch 2’s big standout feature is its new mouse mode enabled just by putting the controller down on a table or your pant’s leg. Lenovo did it first on the Legion Go with its FPS mode. So is it any better now? No, absolutely not. You still need to remove the right controller and flick the “FPS” switch to turn on an optical mouse sensor. You then need to slot it into a base to hold it like an old-school flight stick, where the two side buttons act as the left and right mouse click. The DPI is still low enough you’ll struggle to get it working on anything but a desk. Even when you do, using a joystick and the FPS controller together necessitates changing the in-game controls. I tried it in both Cyberpunk 2077 and Borderlands 4, and it caused such havoc with both titles I was loathe to use the FPS mode again.\n\nAs for I/O, the Legion Go 2 has both a bottom and top USB-4 port. In theory, this could allow you to hook it up to an eGPU. More likely, it’s sole purpose is for charging or hooking up to a dock for HDMI passthrough. As much as Lenovo implies you’ll create a full “battle station” out of your device for instantaneous PC, you don’t want to hook it up to anything larger than a 1440p monitor, and only then for playing games most systems can run anyway.\n\nStrangely enough, one of the best improvements over the last generation handheld is the Legion Go 2’s new soft carrying case. The old case was very protective, but it was also enormous. The new version is smaller and more squat than the default Steam Deck case, which makes lugging around the 8.8-inch handheld onto planes surprisingly easy. There’s two little hidey-holes for the FPS mode stand, but since you’ll never use it, you can stick anything else in there. Just don’t tell me what.\n\nThe Legion Go 2 is so damn pretty\n\nAll the new ergonomics make it easier to hold, but not enough that it won’t feel heavy in your hands. You’ll find you’ll need a table or lap to rest your elbows on, or else you’ll use the built-in kickstand to prop it up on your desk. Either way you hold it, you’ll end up enjoying this handheld mostly for the display. As I said earlier, the 8.8-inch OLED display is sublime. It doesn’t have any higher screen resolution than the Legion Go’s 1,920 x 1,200, but it’s enough to make games pop.\n\nFor my hands, the Legion Go 2 is just large enough where I can grip it and access all the controls. Other users who are smaller in stature may not be so lucky. Ignore all those 11-inch handhelds out there. Near-9-inch devices are more than enough. The screen also sports a 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, or variable refresh rate. All those games that can hit above 100 fps (which, let’s be honest, will mostly be older or 2D titles), will look their peak on the Legion Go 2.\n\nThe screen feels bright enough indoors, but while Lenovo promises you’ll get 1,100 nits of HDR brightness, the screen is not great for using outdoors. It’s blinded by direct sunlight, and even sitting near a window you’ll see most details disappear. The screen is also very reflective. A matte coating would have dulled the display quality, but it’s at the risk of catching a glimpse of your girlfriend walking up behind you.\n\nRyzen Z2 Extreme isn’t a huge leap\n\nThe AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU is purely iterative. If you’ve been watching like a hawk, hoping to devour the latest and fastest handheld chip, this isn’t it. The performance difference generation to generation is minimal. In some games, you could get 5 to 10 fps more at the highest TDP, or thermal design power, People who focus too hard on benchmarks will come away disappointed. If you care more about whether the system can play the latest AAA games, know that you’ll be able to achieve playable frame rates at the max 1200p resolution though only by dropping any hope of ray tracing for more-realistic lighting effects.\n\nSee Lenovo Legion Go 2 at Best Buy\n\nI’m fundamentally a gamer who refuses to drop the resolution of games for the sake of performance. I will lower graphics settings in a desperate attempt to eek out the minimum 30 fps. The Legion Go 2 can manage to take some AAA games into playable states at the max 35W of TDP (thermal design power) once the handheld’s engines are firing on all cylinders. TDP determines how much power is being sent to the processor, which will dictate overall performance. Borderlands 4 is one of those games notorious for running poorly on PC and consoles alike (you won’t find the game on Switch 2 in the coming days, either). I was able to get a stable sub-40 fps on the lowest possible graphics settings. I could achieve a little better frame rates in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Even at lower graphics settings, the game still looks and sounds great on the small screen.\n\nOlder games fare better. Control could average 40 to 49 fps at low settings with the handheld plugged in. The Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark at 1200p and medium settings preset with AMD’s FSR upscaling saw an average of 44 fps, while at 1080p with the same settings it could hit 48 fps. In Baldur’s Gate III, I could average above 60 fps in the open areas of Act 1 and get between 45 and 55 fps in the city environments of Act III.\n\nIn 3DMark benchmarks, the Legion Go 2 hit a score of 3,305 and 24.48 average fps in Steel Nomad Lite tests. That’s 1,000 points better than the Legion Go S with its Ryzen Z2 Go chip running on Windows, but it’s only a little more than 300 points better than the Z1 Extreme on the Asus ROG Ally X from 2024. The new device hit 3,897 points in Time Spy tests, which again is barely more than 300 points better than an Ally X. It’s not much better than an MSI Claw 8 AI+, which uses a full Intel laptop chip. Simply put, the Legion Go 2 isn’t a huge step over the previous gen at the max wattage.\n\nHowever, the device’s secret sauce is in how well it performs at lower wattages. Tests with multiple games at wattages as low as 34 fps still enabled relatively stable frame rates in games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider. While in Cyberpunk 2077 at full resolution and Steam Deck settings, the device gets 44 fps in benchmarks, at 15W it still managed to eek out nearly 30 fps. I don’t expect anybody will run high-end games on lower power. Instead, the best experience comes from games that are far less intensive. I could net well over 160 fps in Hades II on the “Balanced” performance setting. Hollow Knight: Silksong seems like it was built with the Legion Go 2 in mind with automatic settings to stay around 144Hz. These games play so gloriously on this handheld, I don’t want to play them on anything else. It’s a shame you have to spend $350 more than an Xbox Ally X jut for that pretty screen and higher refresh rate.\n\nWindows still sucks for handhelds, but it could get better\n\nOn balanced power settings, I could game for around 2 hours and 40 minutes before the device was literally begging me to plug it in. In other tests where I was gaming at the full resolution and wattage playing Indiana Jones, it lasted closer to 2 hours. The Legion Go 2 sports a 74Wh battery, which is slightly worse than the ROG Ally X’s 80Wh. The larger OLED display and higher max resolution will inevitably drag the battery life down.\n\nAt this point, players should not expect a handheld that will last very long. The ROG Ally X still has one of the best battery life at full power when it gets closer to 3 hours of runtime. In real life, the difference is negligible. At this point in my life, having a max two hours of playtime is strangely beneficial. If I’m clearing room after room in Hades II late at night, the battery timer is essentially my alarm. If it’s close to 12 a.m. and I’m about to run out of power, it’s a sign I should get some rest.\n\nDepending on the game you’re playing, the device’s fans can get relatively loud. Even at max speed I wouldn’t call them jet engine noise. It’s enough to remind you to be mindful when sitting next to strangers on a plane. The device kept very cool in my time using it. I never felt any heat around the controls, and the area around the fans also didn’t feel steamy when playing a game at max wattage.\n\nI can’t excuse the price, but I had such a good time with the Legion Go 2 it felt like a personal companion after traveling for more than a week and a half away from home. But there’s an elephant in the room shaped like a big “X” we need to address. The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are supposed to launch with a new version of Windows, dubbed the “Full Screen Experience” (FSE) built exclusively for gaming handhelds. While this may fix the lingering usability issues of Windows 11 on a 7- or 8-inch screen, the upgrade should also eliminate background tasks and—hopefully—boost performance by 20%. The issue is that Microsoft has said you may need to wait until next spring to get it on handhelds like the Legion Go 2.\n\nWindows is terrible on handhelds. It gets in the way when trying to put the device to sleep while still in-game. It bombards you with popups for OneDrive that you need to use the touchscreen to excise. It saps power and makes the device run worse than it would if it was running SteamOS, the same Linux-based operating system running on the Steam Deck. In our tests, the Legion Go S with SteamOS outperforms its Windows counterpart by 20 to 30%. Unless you’re dead set on keeping your Xbox Game Pass games handy, I would suggest looking into installing Valve’s software on the Legion Go 2. I have not confirmed whether you can install SteamOS on the new handheld, though if its not compatible at launch, I assume an update may be around the corner. Without the FSE or SteamOS, this can’t be my handheld of choice. With a new operating system, the Legion Go 2 would become the bell of the ball for modern PC handhelds.\n\nSee Lenovo Legion Go 2 at Best Buy",

      "content": "The story of Intel's first 18A product, \"Panther Lake,\" remains shrouded in mystery, at least for a few more days. According to earlier reports, Intel was expected to start shipping the first PTL-U and PTL-H SKUs by the end of 2025, with additional SKUs to follow in 2026. However, that situation could be subject to change, according to Golden Pig Upgrade. The rumored October 9 launch date is reserved only for the microarchitecture deep dive, and the launch and final specifications of specific models will occur at CES 2026. Being Intel's first big bet with the 18A node, Panther Lake is a product of years of Intel's manufacturing innovation, which needs to demonstrate that the investment in advanced manufacturing was worthwhile. Reportedly, Intel started limited shipments of its 18A nodes to U.S. customers in Q3, with these wafers already in production and initial output of its own CPUs expected in Q4.Given that Panther Lake is the first 18A node product, we could expect that to be a large part of those shipped wafers, most likely going to OEMs for testing before integration. As a reminder, the low-power PTL-U models are designed for a 15 W TDP and are expected to come in 6-core and 8-core versions. Some SKUs will feature four high-performance P-cores paired with four LPE-cores, while others will have only two LPE-cores complementing four P-cores. Both families will utilize Xe3-based integrated graphics, with entry models featuring four GPU cores. The more powerful PTL-H line will scale up to around 16 CPU cores, comprising four P-Cores, eight E-cores, and four LPE-cores. Some H-series parts might include up to 12 GPU Xe3 cores for integrated graphics, but the final configurations will be revealed when Intel officially launches the Panther Lake product family.",

Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for BI\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe day trader persona on social media looks something like this: A man with a sporty vibe and the swagger of a finance bro says he hit it big in the stock market — and you can too.\n\nYou probably don't envision a room of tired 9-5 workers, poring over candlestick charts and quietly looking for their next big trade. Yet, that's what I found in midtown Manhattan last week when I shadowed an in-person trading course hosted by TraderDaddy, a trading education and mentoring company that says it's been successful at turning some amateurs into profitable traders.\n\nThere are no guarantees, Daniel Alhanti, the CEO and head instructor at TraderDaddy, told the room. Much of a trader's success depends on how hard they're willing to work to understand the market, he said.\n\nThe well-known difficulty of day trading hasn't stopped many Americans who quietly dream of quitting the 9-to-5 lifestyle from trying to make a living in the market. Many, too, have dropped serious cash on courses, coaching, and other kinds of mentorship to boost their chance of success.\n\nThese services have been around for a long time, but they've become more sought after in the years since the pandemic retail-trading boom. According to the Google Trends analytic tool Glimpse, global search interest for \"day trading class\" is up 700% the past quarter and hit an all-time high this summer. Search interest in \"trading coach\" is up 325% over the same timeframe, while interest in \"day trading group\" is up 572%.\n\nOn Coursera, enrollment in online trading courses soared 213% from 2019 to 2024, according to data the online course provider shared with Business Insider. The online trading platform Webull also says it's seen the number of users on its learning platform grow 37% over the last three years.\n\nTraderDaddy's Alhanti, who worked as a financial advisor before becoming a trading instructor, said he witnessed firsthand the surge in interest in trading courses and groups, such as the one he runs.\n\n\"And a lot of it is the same story,\" he said of the wave of newcomers in recent years. \"'I was watching trading on social media, saw people doing it, and I tried to teach myself on YouTube. I couldn't really find anyone else that was doing it, and I was just looking for someone to help me.'\"\n\nAlhanti, who worked as a financial advisor before becoming a trading instructor, says he can identify a successful trader when he sees one. Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for BI\n\nThe class I attended took place in the evening and had about 30 people in it, with men making up about three-quarters of the class. People trickled into the coworking space a little before 7 p.m. and began to whip out their notebooks, giving it a college lecture vibe.\n\nHere's everything I took away from the night.\n\nThere were a lot of beginners eager to get started\n\n\"Who here is an absolute beginner?\" Alhanti said, gauging the sprinkling of hands that popped into the air. \"Who here has invested in crypto? Option contracts?\"\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nI was surprised at how many in the group appeared to be new to this. Later, when Alhanti asked traders to list the top market-moving events of 2024, the class seemed stumped before someone brought up the presidential election, tariffs, and the Fed rate-cutting cycle.\n\nTraderDaddy says it has noticed an explosion of interest in day trading groups in recent years. Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for BI\n\nAttendees were passionate about markets\n\nThere seemed to be high enthusiasm for the market. In a side discussion, a few traders spoke heatedly about option contracts for Palantir and whether a particular trade had been profitable.\n\n\"I think they just want to make money more than anything,\" Gerardo Arevalo, a trader at the event, told me, speaking about the work ethic of the group.\n\nAlhanti says he can tell when a trader will be successful. \"You can see it in their eyes when they focus,\" he told me after the class.\n\nBecoming a successful trader is notoriously hard. A 2020 study found that 97% of investors who traded for more than 300 days lost money, and less than 1% earned $54 or more a day.\n\nTechnical analysis and independent thinking were emphasized\n\nFor two hours, Alhanti walked the group through candlestick charts and technical analysis for trades he said his students were most interested in, which included Apple, Tesla, Intel, and the broader S&P 500. The goal was to identify a price breakout—such as when a stock suddenly trades above its 200-day moving average—and of course, buy at the right time.\n\nAlhanti said he wanted to see traders become confident and skilled enough to make their own decisions when trading, as opposed to relying on him to tell them when to buy and sell.\n\nSometimes, when traders in the group make a profit, they text Alhanti in a panic, asking him what to do next, he said.\n\n\"Do not just blindly follow me,\" he said to the class.\n\nMany desire to quit their jobs\n\nA strong desire for financial freedom was a common sentiment among the aspiring traders.\n\nJoshua Villas, a 23-year-old trader who sat in the back, told me he'd spent more than $900 on trading courses. He said he became interested in trading after a conversation with a friend not long after graduating from high school. The gist of the conversation was that day-trading was a ticket to financial freedom.\n\n\"Just hearing that and knowing that someone told you and actually seeing it's real — You kind of just keep going and trying,\" Villas said.\n\nVillas, who was recently laid off from his job as a stylist, added: \"I'd say the end goal is just not to have to worry about survival. I would be happy if I was just able to make enough to keep living.\"\n\nAlhanti says he frequently comes across aspiring traders who say they feel lost or stuck in their careers. Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet for BI\n\nThat's a common story among many traders Alhanti works with. In recent years, he says he's met more younger people who are aspiring traders, people who are unsure of how to start their careers but want income and are seeking mentorship.\n\n\"They don't really know what type of career they want, or where to go, or what to do, but they know that they want to have multiple incomes in their life, trading being one of them,\" Alhanti said.\n\nYacoub Rahman, a 21-year-old college student who trades on the side, said his goal is also to one day become a full-time trader. That endpoint is appealing, largely because trading \"full-time\" isn't anything like working a full-time job, he said.\n\n\"I don't think it would take a long time. Two or three hours, I guess that's enough,\" he predicted about the amount of work required each day.\n\nRahman said he spent around three hours a day studying the market after completing his schoolwork. He added that he aspired to one day have plenty of free time to travel.\n\nArevalo, a 50-year-old trader and computer programmer, said he had effectively entered early retirement and was looking to trade for a living.\n\nBefore trading, Arevalo said he job-hopped, as he was past his prime as a coder and felt expendable to companies he worked for. He now spends six to eight hours a day trading.\n\nAlhanti says he feels bad for many of the traders who come to him feeling lost in their careers, particularly younger people. He himself was caught in the 2008 recession, when the job market for young adults was brutal.\n\n\"They just generally feel behind, and they don't really know what their next steps are,\" he said of younger traders. \"I think a lot of them are really trying to find something that is going to really put them ahead.\"",

The majority of those who responded to the poll predicted that EV sales would fall off a cliff.\n\nNow, it’s too early to tell yet; we are just a few days past the end of the quarter. But the expiring tax credit did give many automakers a bit of a sales bump as consumers raced to buy EVs before the deadline.\n\nTesla, which has seen sales growth diminish, just registered its best quarter of deliveries ever at 497,099 vehicles. That’s a massive 29% jump from the second quarter, about a 7% increase over the same period last year, and more than it has ever delivered in a single quarter.\n\nFord Motor, General Motors, and Hyundai also reported record quarterly sales of EVs. Rivian saw deliveries jump to 13,201 vehicles, up from 10,661 and 8,640 in the second and first quarters, respectively.\n\nThe looming question is how will automakers navigate a possible slowdown in EV sales in this post-tax credit era? Rivian has already adjusted its guidance down for 2025. Others may follow.\n\nThe crux for automakers is how to get rid of inventory as the new 2026 models come in without reducing or eliminating profit margins (and in some cases deepening the losses)?\n\nA little bird\n\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\n\nThe Department of Energy canceled 321 clean energy projects but wasn’t sharing the details with TechCrunch or the public. Luckily, a little bird shared the complete list of awards the Trump administration had canceled, and the results were revealing.\n\nAltogether, the canceled awards totaled $7.56 billion, with California bearing the brunt, losing $2.2 billion worth of grants, including a $630 million grid-modernization program that could have become a template for the nation. Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Oregon rounded out the top eight, losing between $300 million and $600 million each.\n\nIt wasn’t until farther down the list that a red state popped up. Indeed, the majority of projects were sited in states that had voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, something many media outlets reported after Office of Management and Budget chief Russell Vought tweeted as much.\n\nBut even in blue states, some awards stuck, possibly due to political connections with the Trump administration or aligned interests. Whatever the case, the move by the DOE suggests the government might be a less reliable partner for businesses, especially small startups.",

      "headline": "Many Debian/Ubuntu Packages For Intel Accelerators & Other Intel Software Have Been Orphaned",
      "content": "In addition to some Intel Linux kernel drivers being \"orphaned\" following the corporate restructuring at Intel between developers being laid off and others deciding to pursue opportunities elsewhere, these changes have also led to a number of Intel-related software packages within Debian being orphaned. In turn these Intel packages are also relied on by Ubuntu and other downstream Debian Linux distributions.Around one dozen Intel packages within the Debian archive were recently orphaned, a.k.a. now being unmaintained following developer departures from Intel with no one currently taking up the new responsibility, with also needing to be a Debian Developer or Debian Maintainer to contribute.\n\nAmong the Intel-related packages within Debian to recently be marked as orphaned include:- The package for configuring the Intel Data Streaming Accelerators \"DSA\" IP on recent Xeon processors. This is needed for properly configuring the DSA accelerators from user-space for interfacing with the kernel drivers.- Intel QuickAssist Technology OpenSSL engine support.- The QuickAssist Technology library for making use of that hardware acceleration for offloading security, authentication, and compression services.- The Zip library utilizing QAT.- The cache monitoring and configuration of Intel Cache Monitoring Technology, Memory Bandwidth Monitoring, and Cache Allocation Technology.- The Intel Low Power Model Daemon for optimizing active idle power on Intel systems.- The Intel Cryptography Primitives Library.- Intel Multi-Buffer Crypto for IPSec.- Intel's NumaTOP observation tool.- Intel's Power Stress and Shaping Tool (PSST).- The Intel Thermal Daemon.- Thunderbolt / USB4 debugging tools.These packages were all orphaned last month and haven't seen anyone stepping up to maintain them for Debian either from Intel Corp or other interested Debian developers from the community or other organizations. This follows some Intel drivers in the upstream Linux kernel being orphaned like the Intel CPU temperature monitoring driver and Intel also having recently ended open-source projects like the x86-simd-sort library and the sad demise of Clear Linux With the user-space accelerator packages like QAT and DSA being impacted as well as various other Intel libraries and even NumaTOP and other utilities, this could pose a problem if no one steps up to maintain these packages long-term. Again, not only Debian itself being affected but also Ubuntu and other downstream Debian-based Linux distributions. This is a set-back for a nice out-of-the-box experience for Intel hardware on Debian/Debian-derived operating systems and could make it more difficult to leverage Intel accelerators moving forward if having to either run the outdated packages, build your own code from source, or relying on generic packages from Intel.com where available. Hopefully this lack of Intel maintainership to these Debian packages can be rectified soon.",

The times they've disagreed on strategy tested their thinking in ways that were \"exponentially beneficial,\" she said. Courtesy Merit America\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nWhen Connor Diemand-Yauman popped the question to Rebecca Taber Staehelin, he got down on a knee and handed her a rose.\n\nHis gesture drew the attention of others at the Italian food hotspot in San Francisco, where the colleagues were discussing how to structure their work partnership.\n\n\"Everyone in the restaurant started applauding because they thought we were getting married,\" Diemand-Yauman told Business Insider.\n\nWhat he was actually asking Taber Staehelin to formalize in 2019 was their decision to serve as co-CEOs of Merit America, a nonprofit they had founded the year before to help low-wage workers build skills and reach the middle class.\n\nDiemand-Yauman and Taber Staehelin's business arrangement is fairly unusual. There are fewer than 40 public companies in the US that operate with dual CEOs, according to the analytics firm Boardroom Alpha. Yet the setup is having a moment: In little more than a week, Spotify, Comcast, and Oracle have recently announced that they will have co-CEOs lead their organizations.\n\nInstead of getting bogged down by the potential risks of partnerships — uneven power splits, fuzzy accountability, or strategic clashes — some companies are embracing the idea that, in a period when many CEOs' remits are broader than ever, more can be more.\n\n\"It really has allowed us to specialize in the things that we're respectively passionate about and great at,\" Mike Sobel, co-CEO of fintech company Trumid, said of the division of labor he has with his counterpart, Ronnie Mateo.\n\nKnowing who does what\n\nSobel joined Trumid in 2014, when the startup was about five months old. For years after, he and a growing number of colleagues — mostly bond traders and salespeople with experience from across Wall Street — worked alongside Mateo to build a fixed-income platform. In the early days, there were few job titles or defined responsibilities, Sobel told Business Insider.\n\n\"It was just like, 'Everyone grab a shovel,'\" he said.\n\nTrumid co-CEOs Ronnie Mateo and Mike Sobel sometimes \"disagree vehemently,\" but because it's in service of the right answer, it's productive, Sobel said. Courtesy Trumid\n\nAs the company grew, especially during the boom years of the pandemic, so did the need to draw sharper contours around who did what. That clarity was necessary, Sobel said, both for new clients and for employees who joined the New York firm when lockdowns meant people weren't coming to the office. When it had been a smaller group in one place, knowing where to go wasn't as much of a challenge, he said.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nTrumid now has 200 employees and saw its average daily trading volume increase by 62% in 2024, reaching $1.4 trillion for the year.\n\n\"It's very important that titles reflect the reality of responsibilities, and who is accountable for what,\" Sobel said. So, in 2021, Trumid elevated him to co-CEO so that he could run the day-to-day, while Mateo, who founded the company, could be the indefatigable \"locker-room leader,\" chief sales guy, and face of the company, Sobel said.\n\n\"Ronnie is the visionary and the star player,\" he said.\n\nSobel said that internally, in particular, staffers understand who runs what and know that they \"can get a final answer from either one of us.\"\n\nAmong the company's half dozen top execs, there's also a clear sense of who is the specialist in each area, he said.\n\nWhen it comes to decision-making, Sobel said, he understands when it's a call he can make on his own versus one that's consequential enough to merit consulting with Mateo or others on the executive team. In some cases, Sobel might simply want a gut check.\n\n\"I should — and want to — talk to my partner about this, because it's really important,\" he said.\n\nAnother key factor, Sobel said, is the faith he and Mateo have in each other and the rest of their team.\n\n\"I trust in terms of motives, and also trust in terms of excellence,\" he said.\n\nWhen disagreements arise\n\nSobel said he and Mateo tend to be the opposite when it comes to their instincts, which can lead to \"heated debates.\"\n\nYet, because both of them are clear on the shared goal, \"you could disagree vehemently, but it's in the service of the right answer,\" he said. \"It is a productive exercise.\"\n\nSobel said the firm subscribes to the \"disagree and commit\" mantra popularized by Jeff Bezos at Amazon, as well as by former Intel CEO Andy Grove. When leaders at Trumid make a decision, the team gets on board and, regardless of how it turns out, \"there is no keeping score,\" Sobel said.\n\nDiemand-Yauman and Taber Staehelin see it similarly. Early on, Taber Staehelin said, before they became \"a hive mind,\" most disagreement emerged over annual budgeting. She said she tended to be more conservative, while Diemand-Yauman sought to be more ambitious in his approach to investing in growth.\n\nTo resolve disputes, Taber Staehelin said, the pair would step back to refocus on what they were trying to accomplish.\n\n\"It really tested the rigor of the thinking in a way that was exponentially beneficial,\" she said.\n\nTaber Staehelin still has the rose that Diemand-Yauman gave her at a restaurant when they decided to become co-CEOs. Courtesy Merit America\n\nThat's why Diemand-Yauman sees value in having a human copilot. \"When you do it right, it is far better than a single CEO, and when you do it wrong, it's far worse.\"\n\nHe said he wouldn't want to be a solo CEO again, as he was at a prior nonprofit he founded.\n\n\"I can't imagine starting or leading something without a partner,\" Diemand-Yauman said. In part, he said, that's because being a sole CEO can be isolating and because it's often hard to get a straight answer from other teammates.\n\nTaber Staehelin still has the rose that Diemand-Yauman gave her, which she keeps in a shoe box. It's a reminder of what each of them, both of whom are married, has invested in their work spouse.\n\n\"You are with someone who is in the trenches with you and can empathize with what you're going through, who will always honor confidentiality and create a safe space for you to vent and problem-solve,\" Diemand-Yauman said.\n\nTaber Staehelin agreed: \"He's Taylor; I'm Travis.\"",

      "headline": "Cramming for Week 5: Five fantasy sleepers, three predictions, three trends and an intriguing bet",
      "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nWeek 5 of the 2025 NFL season is here, and our NFL analysts have you covered in the eleventh hour. Don't miss our last-minute prep for a loaded slate.\n\nHere's what we have: First, analytics writer Seth Walder breaks down three stat trends that could be pivotal this weekend. Then fantasy football writer Eric Moody runs through five players who are rostered in under 50% of ESPN fantasy football leagues as of Saturday and could be started in a jam. That's followed by NFL analyst Matt Bowen predicting three potentially big surprises and sports betting analyst Pamela Maldonado giving her favorite bet for Week 5.\n\nWill the Giants' offense roll against the Saints? Can Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson get multiple sacks against the Bengals? Will Browns CB Denzel Ward snag an interception for the second straight game? Which two QBs have sneaky fantasy value this week? And could we see a bunch of points in the Raiders-Colts game? Let's dive in.\n\nJump to:\n\nStat trends | Fantasy sleepers\n\nPotential surprises | Best bet\n\nWalder: Three key stat trends that could determine Week 5 winners\n\nCan Giants receivers Wan'Dale Robinson and Darius Slayton step up against the Saints?\n\nThe numbers suggest they can. New Orleans has one of the most pass-inducing defenses in the NFL, ranking second highest in pass rate over expectation allowed (plus-2%), per NFL Next Gen Stats. It's easy to see why. While the Saints' defense allows minus-0.10 EPA per designed carry (ninth best), it allows 0.25 EPA per dropback (fourth worst).\n\nTwenty-one percent of passes against New Orleans are thrown to receivers in the slot, which ought to specifically help Robinson, who has lined up in the slot 69% of the time. It doesn't end there, as the Saints have allowed 8.6 air yards per attempt this season (fourth most), which should play right into the hands of Slayton, a deep threat who is averaging 12.7 air yards per target.\n\nIs Lions edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson headed for another multi-sack day against the Bengals?\n\nI'm a little surprised to see the Lions leading the entire league in defensive sack rate (10.6%), but Hutchinson is hot since returning from leg surgery. He has a sack in three straight games, including two last Sunday against the Browns. He also ranked in the top five in pass rush win rate at edge that week. Now he and the Lions get to face a Bengals team that is struggling mightily in pass protection.\n\nAs a team, the Bengals rank dead last in pass block win rate (44.6%). Against the Broncos last week, both tackles Amarius Mims and Orlando Brown Jr. ranked in the bottom five in pass block win rate at their position. Add in that backup QB Jake Browning has been sacked 8% of the time (higher-than-average rate), and that the Bengals should have to pass plenty as underdogs. So Hutchinson (and perhaps Al-Quadin Muhammad) should be in for a productive pass rushing day.\n\nCan RB Woody Marks and the Texans have rushing success against the Ravens?\n\nMarks, a fourth-round rookie, burst onto the scene against the Titans with 17 carries for 69 yards and a rushing touchdown; he also had 50 more yards and a touchdown in the receiving game. And there's reason to believe that success could continue this week, thanks to a schematic change this season.\n\nUnder new offensive coordinator Nick Caley, the Texans have shifted from a heavy outside zone team to a heavy duo team, a downhill scheme that uses double-team blocks. Since the start of last season, the Ravens have allowed 3.4 yards per carry to outside zone but 5.0 to duo. The Lions, most notably, gashed Baltimore with duo plays (9.5 yards per carry!) in Week 3.\n\nMoody: Five fantasy sleepers you need to pick up -- and can start this week\n\nRico Dowdle, RB, Carolina Panthers (39.6% rostered)\n\nChuba Hubbard has been ruled out of Sunday's game against the Dolphins with a calf injury, putting Dowdle in line for a heavy workload. He should find success against a Miami defensive front that ranks 28th in run stop win rate and has allowed the seventh-most fantasy points per game to running backs this season. Last season with the Cowboys, Dowdle averaged 12.3 fantasy points in games where he saw 15 or more touches.\n\nJaxson Dart, QB, New York Giants (36.6% rostered)\n\nDart hit the ground running against the Chargers in his first career start, not only leading the Giants to a win but also delivering 19.8 fantasy points. He generates production with both his arm and his legs, and as Seth mentioned above, he has capable targets in Robinson, Slayton and Theo Johnson. The rookie draws a favorable matchup against a Saints defense that has allowed the fifth-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.\n\nplay 1:21 Warner: You could feel the spark Jaxson Dart gave the Giants Kurt Warner joins \"The Rich Eisen Show\" to recap Jaxson Dart's performance vs. the Chargers.\n\nElic Ayomanor, WR, Tennessee Titans (35.5% rostered)\n\nAyomanor is the lone bright spot in a Titans offense that ranks 31st in total yards per game (210.5) and 32nd in points per game (12.8). He leads Tennessee in targets (25), receiving yards (151) and touchdowns (2), averaging 9.8 fantasy points per game. That's a solid floor, but his ceiling could be even higher against a Cardinals defense that has allowed the third-most receptions per game to wide receivers.\n\nBrenton Strange, TE, Jacksonville Jaguars (35.1% rostered)\n\nStrange has posted at least 10 fantasy points and seven targets in two straight games. He also leads the Jaguars in receptions (19) and receiving yards (182). He offers fantasy managers a high floor, with at least four catches and 45 yards in three games this season. Strange hasn't found the end zone yet, but that could change against the Chiefs, who might prioritize stopping the Jaguars' prolific running game in the red zone.\n\nBryce Young, QB, Carolina Panthers (15.2% rostered)\n\nYoung is off to a poor start for the second straight season, and a strong performance against Miami could be crucial to getting back on track. He is averaging just 12.9 fantasy points per game, but the Dolphins' defense has allowed the second-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Carolina would be wise to lean on its run game behind an offensive line that ranks seventh in run block win rate, and then build off that with play-action passes against a subpar Miami pass rush.\n\nBowen: Don't be surprised if ...\n\nGiants RB Cam Skattebo scores a touchdown against the Saints\n\nWith Skattebo taking over the lead role in New York, his volume and scoring opportunities are up in Brian Daboll's offense. Skattebo scored a touchdown in two of the past three games and had seven goal-to-goal carries. Plus, with his pass-catching ability (12 receptions), Skattebo could find the end zone on an underneath throw from quarterback Jaxson Dart. The Saints has allowed nine touchdowns through the air this season, which is tied for third worst in the league.\n\nAll of ESPN. All in one place. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Sign Up Now\n\nBrowns CB Denzel Ward gets another interception versus Vikings\n\nMinnesota quarterback Carson Wentz threw two interceptions last week against the Steelers, and his 38.7 QBR was third worst out of all quarterbacks who started the past two weeks. Behind a Browns defensive front that has generated a pressure rate of 37.8%, the fifth highest in the league, Ward will have opportunities to make plays on the ball, especially when Wentz's decision-making declines late in the down. Ward notched his first interception of the season versus the Lions in Week 4.\n\nLions WR Jameson Williams catches a pass over 25 yards against the Bengals\n\nThe Bengals' defense has allowed six completions of 25 or more yards this season, and I like Williams to create an explosive play. He has seen seven targets of 25 or more air yards through four games, including four against the Browns (only one resulted in a reception). Look for the Lions to set up Jared Goff on a deep shot here, with Williams stretching the defense at the third level.\n\nMaldonado: My favorite bet for Week 5\n\nOVER 47.5 points in Las Vegas Raiders at Indianapolis Colts\n\nThe Colts move the ball better than almost anyone, leading the league in success rate (52.8%) and averaging over 7.0 yards on first down. The Raiders' defense has struggled to get stops, especially in the red zone, where opponents are scoring touchdowns nearly 89% of the time. Indianapolis QB Daniel Jones should also thrive against Las Vegas' heavy Cover 3 looks.\n\nWhile the Raiders' offense is inconsistent, Indy's defense isn't exactly shutting anyone down either, ranking near the bottom in success rate and red zone efficiency. Both teams should finish drives, and if the Raiders are chasing points late, that only helps this matchup to hit the over.",

      "content": "Intel in talks to produce AMD chips despite major technology hurdles\n\nAMD may shift limited production to Intel while protecting flagship processors\n\nWashington favors US chipmaking as Intel woos investors and potential customers\n\nBack in February 2025, well before everyone suddenly got interested in throwing money at Intel, I wrote that the iconic but beleaguered chip maker could be about to merge with GlobalFoundries - a rumor made all the more salacious as GloFlo is AMD’s former foundry.\n\nThe headline I gave it started with “Hell freezes, pigs fly” because frankly it seemed like an unlikely situation.\n\nFast forward to now, and Semafor is reporting that Intel is in early talks to add AMD as a foundry customer, which isn’t as unlikely as it would have been a few months ago, but still…\n\nNot flagship chips though\n\nIntel has been on something of a charm offensive lately, seeking customers and investors to back its push to establish itself as a contract chipmaker.\n\nIn recent weeks it has lined up financial support from the White House, Nvidia, and SoftBank, been in talks with Apple and TSMC, and no doubt had a few behind closed door conversations with other members of the so-called Magnificent 7.\n\nFor AMD, any foundry deal with Intel would be more than a little complicated. Its most advanced processors are built on TSMC’s leading-edge nodes, which Intel can’t yet match.\n\nThis makes it unlikely AMD would hand over production of its flagship products to its long-time rival.\n\nAre you a pro?

That would make the most sense to me, due to supply distances. Makes little to no sense to do chips in the USA, send them to Taiwan/Malaysia and then back to the USA.”\n\nIt's not yet clear how far discussions have gone, or whether they would involve AMD taking a direct stake in Intel’s foundry arm, as other partners have done.\n\nSemafor says both companies have so far declined to comment on the matter.\n\nFollow TechRadar on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

      "headline": "Ultra-rare unreleased Pentium 4 with 4.0 GHz clock speed discovered — CPU-Z confirms it is an Intel Pentium Extreme Edition 980",
      "content": "A rare Intel engineering sample from the twilight of the Pentium 4 era has surfaced on social media. We’ve never seen this 4.0 GHz chip before. On Reddit, the current owner of the purported Intel Pentium Extreme Edition 980 processor, diegunguyman, has shared photos of the chip, both front and back, along with a CPU-Z screenshot for some deeper technical details. Due to quirks with the CPU-Z app/online database, this CPU won’t validate correctly.\n\nDiegunguyman reached out on various Subreddits to try and glean more insight into his find. The basic backstory was that “The only text on the CPU itself was written in Sharpie, just the model number and clock speed, 4 GHz.” With no official documentation to reference, the Redditor turned to experts on Subreddits like r/pcmasterrace and r/Intel to seek answers.\n\nA rare breed\n\nThis particular dual-core Hyperthreaded ‘Presler’ P4 is a very interesting sample for a number of reasons. Firstly, the collective wisdom of the flock of attentive Redditors interested in this story indicates that the sample now owned by diegunguyman was likely a loaner chip given to an employee.\n\nThese Employee Loaner Chips are rarer than typical Engineering Samples (ES). Their rarity is probably bolstered by the strict terms of the loan. However, a purported Intel ‘insider’ on Reddit indicates that due to the extensive layoffs at the firm, policing of the loaner system has evaporated.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this CPU is the reasons that the public never saw with the pinnacle of NetBurst. It is now a matter for the history books, but the processor line already had a poor reputation for its thermals and performance, which played a part.\n\nPivot: Plan B becomes Plan A\n\nWhat likely sealed this ‘ghost’ processor’s fate was Intel’s strategic pivot. Management was already shifting focus to the legendary Core 2 lineup, built on the mobile-first Core microarchitecture. Then we saw Intel’s marketing shift to focusing on the entirely reasonable performance-per-watt metric, and the NetBurst design was quickly relegated to history, with budget / entry-level chips being the primary beneficiaries.\n\nIt is probably fair to say Intel’s Haifa design team and its mobile-first Core microarchitecture were Intel’s saviors. From mid-2006, the new performance-per-watt tuned chips managed to effectively stall the momentum of AMD’s contemporaneous CPUs like the Athlon 64 and X2 designs on the desktop.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.
