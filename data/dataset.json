            "headline": "Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI investment raises eyebrows and a key question: How much of the AI boom is just Nvidia’s cash being recycled?",
            "content": "Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently. The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back.\n\nIn addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.\n\nThe extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.\n\nIn past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.\n\nNvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStartups financing data centers have often had to borrow money at rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% that a large, established corporation such as Microsoft might have to pay. With Nvidia’s backing, OpenAI and Coreweave have been able to borrow at rates closer to what Microsoft or Google might pay.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also signed a $6.3 billion deal to purchase any cloud capacity that CoreWeave can’t sell to others. The chipmaker had previously agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years on cloud computing with CoreWeave. Coreweave, meanwhile, has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs so far—the majority of which it says are H100 Hopper models, which cost about $30,000 each—which means Coreweave has spent about $7.5 billion buying these chips from Nvidia. So in essence, all of the money Nvidia has invested in Coreweave has come back to it in the form of revenue.\n\n\n\nNvidia has struck similar cloud computing deals with other so-called “neo-cloud” companies. According to a story in The Information, Nvidia agreed this summer to spend $1.3 billion over four years renting some 10,000 of its own AI chips from Lambda, which like Coreweave runs data centers, as well as a separate $200 million deal to rent some 8,000 more over an unspecified time period.\n\nFor those who believe there’s an AI bubble, the Lambda deal is clear evidence of froth. Those Nvidia chips Lambda is renting time on back to Nvidia? It bought them with borrowed money collateralized by the value of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\n\nBesides its large investments in OpenAI and Coreweave, AI chipmaker also holds multi-million dollar stakes in several other publicly-traded companies that either purchase its GPUs or work on related chip technology. These include chip design firm Arm, high-performance computing company Applied Digital, cloud services company Nebius Group, and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals. (Nvidia also recently purchased a 4% stake in Intel for $5 billion. Like Arm, Intel makes chips that in some cases are alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, but which for the most part are complementary to them.)\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia also pledged to invest £2 billion ($2.7 billion) in U.K. AI startups, including at least £500 million in Nscale, a U.K.-based data center operator that will, presumably, be using some of that money to purchase Nvidia GPUs to provision the data centers it is building. Nvidia also said it would invest in a number of British startups, both directly and through local venture capital firms, and some of that money too, will likely come back to OpenAI in the form of computing purchases, either directly, or through cloud service providers, who in turn will need to buy Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia invested about $1 billion in AI startups globally either directly or through its corporate venture capital arm NVentures, according to data from Dealroom and The Financial Times. This amount was up significantly from what Nvidia invested in 2022, the year the generative AI boom kicked off with OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nHow much of this money winds up coming right back to Nvidia in the form of sales is again, difficult to determine. Wall Street research firm NewStreet Research has estimated that for every $10 billion Nvidia invests in OpenAI, it will see $35 billion worth of GPU purchases or GPU lease payments, an amount equal to about 27% of its annual revenues last fiscal year.\n\nEchoes of the dotcom era\n\nThat kind of return would certainly make this sort of customer financing worthwhile. But it does raise concerns among analysts about a bubble in AI valuations. These kinds of circular deals have been a hallmark of previous technology bubbles and have often come back to haunt investors.\n\nIn this case, the lease arrangements that Nvidia is entering into with OpenAI as part of its latest investment could prove problematic. By leasing GPUs to OpenAI, rather than requiring them to buy the chips outright, Nvidia is sparing OpenAI from having to take an accounting charge for the high depreciation rates on the chips, which will ultimately help OpenAI’s bottom line. But it means that instead Nvidia will have to bear this depreciation costs. What’s more, Nvidia will also take on the risk of being stuck with an inventory of GPUs no one wants if demand for AI workloads don’t match Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rosy predictions.\n\n\n\nTo some market watchers, Nvidia’s latest deals feel all-too-similar to the excesses of past technology booms. During the dot com bubble at the turn of the 21st Century, telecom equipment makers such as Nortel, Lucent, and Cisco lent money to startups and telecom companies to purchase their equipment. Just before the bubble burst in 2001, the amount of financing Cisco and Nortel had extended to their customers exceeded 10% of annual revenues, and the amount of financing the top five telecom equipment makers had provided to customers exceeded 123% of their combined earnings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the amount of fiber-optic cabling and switching equipment installed far exceeded demand, and when the bubble burst and many of those customers went bust, the telecom equipment makers were left holding the bad debt on their balance sheets. This contributed to a greater loss of value when the bubble burst than would have otherwise been the case, with networking equipment businesses losing more than 90% of their value over the ensuing decade.\n\n\n\nWorse yet were companies such as fiber-optic giant Global Crossing that engaged in direct “revenue roundtripping.” These companies cut deals—often at the end of a quarter in order to hit topline forecasts—in which they paid money to another company for services, and then that company agreed to purchase equipment of exactly equal value. When the bubble burst, Global Crossing went bankrupt, and its executives ultimately paid large legal settlements related to revenue roundtripping.\n\n\n\nIt is memories of these kinds of transactions that have caused analysts to at least raise an eyebrow at some of Nvidia’s circular investments. Goldberg, the Seaport Global analyst, said the deals had a whiff of circular financing and were emblematic of “bubble-like behavior.”\n\n“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note following Nvidia’s announcement of its blockbuster investment in OpenAI. It’s a long way from a concern to a crisis, of course, but as AI company valuations get higher, that distance is starting to close.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i is the premium, feature-packed 16-inch powerhouse for those who need to work, create, and even game on the go. It's an excellent, incredibly practical laptop that feels like the more reasonable alternative to the divisive Dell 16 Premium (previously the Dell XPS 16). I only wish battery life was better, but I can't say I'm shocked it's not.\n\nWhy you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nCreators, engineers, and other professionals the world over rely on powerful 16-inch laptops to keep them working smoothly, even while staying mobile. The Dell XPS 16 (now the Dell 16 Premium), the Apple MacBook Pro 16, the Razer Blade 16 — these are all great choices, but there's another excellent alternative on the block.\n\nThis is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition... which is a ridiculously long name for an incredibly capable laptop with a practical design, potent performance, and an impressive set of features that make it well-suited to almost any task.\n\nIt's also well priced compared to the aforementioned competition, making it one of the easiest to recommend. While other laptops often focus on sleek and minimalist designs (often at the expense of features or practicality), the Yoga Pro 9i doesn't cut any corners — or ports.\n\nDisclaimer This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. Lenovo had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.\n\nMy Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) review\n\nImage 1 of 4 The clean Lenovo logo and \"communications bar\" are in full display with this laptop. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Most people would be content with just the ports on one side. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) I'd prefer swapping one of those Type-A ports for a Thunderbolt 4 port on the other side, but this is a great I/O selection either way. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) These aren't the slimmest bezels on the block, but the Yoga Pro 9i still feels plenty premium. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDesign ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWhere the Dell 16 Premium (2025) we recently reviewed boasts a controversial, futuristic, and minimalist design, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i absolutely prioritizes function over form.\n\nIt's a familiar two-tier Lenovo design with a rounded base and squared-off lid, creating a unique profile entirely constructed of high-quality aluminum. The Yoga Pro 9i isn't the most refined high-end laptop I've held in my hand and doesn't feature the slimmest display bezel, but it absolutely looks and feels like a premium product.\n\nYou can immediately tell the Yoga Pro 9i is a truly premium laptop, even if it's not the most futuristic design.\n\nAt around 17.9mm thick and 1.93kg heavy, there are certainly beefier 16-inch workstations, but the Yoga Pro 9i's design does make it seem chunkier than it actually is.\n\nAt least you get a ton of ports. There's the 170W DC power port, an HDMI 2.1 port, two full-featured Thunderbolt 4 ports with Power Delivery and DisplayPort functions, a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB Type-A (5GBps) ports, a side-mounted power button, a webcam privacy shutter, and even a full-sized SD card slot. The only things missing are an Ethernet port (Lenovo would've had to make this laptop a fair bit thicker for that) and a Kensington Nano Security Slot, which may actually disappoint some professional users.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDisplay ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nLenovo actually offers two OLED, touchscreen PureSight Pro display options for the Yoga Pro 9i. Both panels boast a 120Hz refresh rate, excellent color accuracy across standard and cinematic gamuts, Dolby Vision HDR and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 1000 support, and the trifecta of TÜV Rheindland Low Blue Light, TÜV Rheinland Flicker-Free, and Eyesafe certifications.\n\nFor an extra $150, though, you can upgrade to a Tandem OLED display with a higher 3.2K resolution (up from 2.8K), even greater color accuracy (especially in the AdobeRGB gamut), twice the display brightness at up to 1,000 nits (compared to 500 nits, and that's not even with HDR enabled), and greater efficiency to boot. Sadly, Lenovo didn't send me that configuration to test, so I can't tell you just how much better that panel is.\n\nThe entry-level screen is still fantastic, though. It's bright, vibrant, and responsive whether I was working, editing photos, gaming, or watching videos. If the Tandem OLED display is even better, it'll be one of the best panels you'll find on a laptop right now.\n\nPerformance ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, a 16-core CPU with fantastic overall performance and solid efficiency. That's backed by up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 (8GB) GPU, but Lenovo sent me the entry-level configuration with an RTX 5050 inside — and it seriously impressed me.\n\nThis laptop is a strong performer in general, backed by Intel Evo guarantees for responsiveness and bolstered by excellent thermal management. The Yoga Pro 9i never got too warm, never suffered from abnormal throttling, and kept quiet enough even under load.\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i was practically guaranteed to deliver great performance, but it still managed to surprise me.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, it's the RTX 5050 that surprised me. Lenovo actually offers a GPU overclocking option, and when enabled the Yoga Pro 9i's RTX 5050 performed well beyond the level I expected, coming within a stone's throw of the far more expensive Dell 16 Premium's RTX 5070 without becoming thermally restrained.\n\nI was able to play Forza Horizon 5 with Extreme settings without any issues, either, never dipping below a stable 60 FPS.\n\nImage 1 of 3 I really like this keyboard, but I'm still not a fan of Lenovo's next key coating. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) There's a lot of power packed into this chassis, but you don't feel it most of the time. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Intel Evo, NVIDIA Studio — this laptop has all the ingredients it needs to tackle any workflow or task. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nBattery life ⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWith an 84Whr battery stashed away inside, the Yoga Pro 9i certainly has plenty of juice... but it's not enough to translate to true all-day battery life. In my testing, the Yoga Pro 9i can deliver around 5 hours of real-time usage — slightly better than the Dell 16 Premium and its larger 99Whr battery, but nothing too impressive.\n\nYou can use up to 100W USB Type-C chargers whenever you're in a pinch, at least. Performance when off the charger is throttled, but is still absolutely what I'd consider \"flagship\" level — especially the graphical oomph.\n\nThis laptop can't claim to boast the greatest endurance, but it's no worse than much of the competition.\n\nKeyboard & touchpad ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI've historically been a huge fan of Lenovo's keyboards, and that still mostly holds true with the Yoga Pro 9i. The layout, key travel, and consistency are all top-notch, and the keyboard doesn't feel too cramped despite having a compact tenkey number pad off to one side (a feature some will love, and others will hate).\n\nAs I noted in my Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i (Gen 9) Aura Edition review, though, the new coating Lenovo puts on its keys isn't my favorite. This is a good keyboard, it's just slippery.\n\nThe touchpad is spacious and responsive with Microsoft Precision drivers, so I have little to complain about there... but I do wish Lenovo would finally embrace haptic touchpads on its premium consumer laptops.\n\nLenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding doesn't mean anything to 99% of people... this laptop still delivers a great software experience, though. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nSoftware & AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i runs Windows 11, and it does so without issue. Drivers are stable and Lenovo hasn't injected an absurd amount of bloatware onto the device.\n\nLenovo didn't pour every feature imaginable into the Yoga Pro 9i, it just focused on delivering a capable, high-quality laptop.\n\nYou also get some extra features courtesy of Lenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding, such as multi-device syncing for photos and files, \"smart\" performance and settings profiles, and Lenovo's \"AI Now\" companion, but the Yoga Pro 9i is not a Copilot+ PC thanks to the weaker NPU of its processor, so it doesn't boast all the latest and greatest artificial intelligence features in Windows.\n\nThat won't make a difference to most people, but it's worth noting this laptop technically isn't on the cutting edge for software.\n\nEverything else ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe display isn't the only reason the Yoga Pro 9i is a monster for entertainment, as it also packs a capable six-speaker system (dual 2W tweeters and quad 2W woofers) with Dolby Atmos support.\n\nI won't go as far as claiming these are the best-sounding speakers in a laptop I've heard, but the Yoga Pro 9i does sound full, loud, and clear. You also get a quad microphone array flanking the great 5MP front-facing camera, which is supported by an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition.\n\nI never had any issues with the Wi-Fi 7 or Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, either. The Yoga Pro 9i doesn't rock any additional features like Human Presence Detection (HPD) or ambient light sensors, or a fingerprint reader, but the basics are covered and they're covered well.\n\nYoga Pro 9i (Gen 10) review: My final thoughts\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i isn't one of the most exciting laptops of 2025, but it is one of my favorites. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\n✅You should buy this if ...\n\nYou need a powerful, feature-packed 16-inch laptop for work and creation.\n\nYou also want that laptop to be good for PC gaming, too.\n\nYou want a laptop with a top-notch OLED display and speaker system.\n\n❌You should not buy this if ...\n\nYou actually care about Windows 11's Copilot+ PC-exclusive features.\n\nYou need a laptop with consistent, easy all-day battery life.\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition may have a slightly ridiculous name, but it's hands-down one of the greatest laptops in the category of \"powerful and premium 16-inch workstations.\"\n\nWhile Apple commits to minimalism and Dell pushes even more aggressively in that direction, Lenovo is delivering an equally capable laptop packed with features and ports — all while undercutting the competition on price. It's a shockingly practical laptop for productivity, creation, entertainment, and gaming.\n\nWhile I do wish the battery could withstand a full day's worth of work without compromise, that doesn't stop this from being one of the best Windows laptops I've tested this year. You can customize your own Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition from $1,869.99 at Lenovo.com, or pull the trigger on the configuration I most recommend for $2,149.99 at Lenovo.com, which upgrades you to that sweet Tandem OLED display and a more powerful RTX 5060 GPU.",

            "headline": "Jensen Huang says China is ‘nanoseconds behind’ the US in chipmaking, calls for reducing US export restrictions on Nvidia's AI chips",
            "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says China is just “nanoseconds behind” the U.S. in chipmaking and that Washington should stop trying to wall off the market. Speaking on the BG2 podcast , Huang argued that allowing companies like Nvidia to sell into China would serve American interests by spreading U.S. technology and extending its geopolitical influence. “We’re up against a formidable, innovative, hungry, fast-moving, underregulated [competitor],” Huang said, talking about the pedigree of China’s engineers and controversial 9-9-6 working culture.\n\nHis comments come as Nvidia hopes to ship its H20 AI GPU to Chinese customers again, following a months-long pause tied to new U.S. export rules. The Commerce Department is understood to have begun issuing licenses for the H20 in August , and Nvidia is already working on a successor chip designed to comply with current restrictions while offering better performance. The company has not confirmed specs, but it would be Nvidia’s second attempt to tailor an AI accelerator specifically for the Chinese marke t since the original A100 and H100 bans took effect.\n\nNVIDIA: OpenAI, Future of Compute, and the American Dream | BG2 w/ Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner - YouTube Watch On\n\nChina, meanwhile, is accelerating its own plans to become self-sufficient. Huawei’s new Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD systems, powered by the company’s Ascend 910B chips , are now shipping in volume. The company has laid out an ambitious roadmap through 2027 with next-gen Ascend silicon that aims to match or exceed current-gen performance. These systems are CUDA-free by design and optimized for Chinese-built software stacks, a shift that puts real pressure on Nvidia’s dominance, which, according to Huang, previously held a 95% market share in China.\n\nChinese hyperscalers are backing that roadmap with capital. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance are all investing in custom silicon, either through internal chip teams or by funding startups. That includes firms like Tencent, which has announced it has fully adapted its infrastructure to support homegrown silicon. Asked what he sees in the near future, Huang said, “They [China] publicly say… they want China to be an open market, they want… companies to come to China and compete in the marketplace… and I believe and I hope that we return to that.”\n\nNvidia’s approach to that is to maintain a foothold in China and play both sides of the geopolitical divide. The H20 may be hobbled compared to the company’s leading chips, but it gives Chinese companies a path to stay within the Nvidia ecosystem — at least for now.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

            "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

There are so many to choose from, I almost don't know where to begin.\n\nFirst, this is an Nvidia (NVDA) market. It's a market that will work for the bulls for as long as Nvidia works. If Nvidia is going to chart a course for AI domination, as seen in its new $100 billion OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) deal on Monday, and the stock gets pushed higher, it's bullish for the broader market.\n\n\"I think AI is a real thing,\" Robinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild said on Opening Bid (video above). \"I still think there's a lot of growth in this country. And you're starting to see it in other sectors, ... in aerospace and defense, for example. So I definitely think it's something you have to pay attention to.

I am not surprised he has gained a stock-moving following. He puts in the hard work to find undervalued names.\n\nJackson shared more about his views on Opendoor during his last appearance on Opening Bid — it's worth a watch.\n\nLastly, if you're a bear, it will be hard to stay that way as long as the Fed is cutting rates. I think Monday's commentary from new Fed member Stephen Miran on the need for a series of rate cuts is where policy may be headed.

            "headline": "Why Nvidia's Blueprint might be the best tool you'll use for 3D modelling",
            "content": "You may have heard of Nvidia Blueprints, but what are they exactly, and why is the latest addition, the new 3D Object Generation Blueprint, so special?\n\nIf you’ve been following NVIDIA’s AI announcements, you’ll know the company has been talking a lot about Blueprints. These are pre-built AI workflows that bundle together several advanced models into one easy-to-use package. For 3D artists, whether you’re a Blender hobbyist or a professional creating assets for games or film, the new 3D Object Generation Blueprint could be an innovative way to improve your workflow.\n\nTo understand more and why Blueprints matter, I spoke with Michael Fukuyama, Product Manager at Nvidia, who has been leading projects focused on creative, productivity, and generative AI use cases.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nRemoving the obstacles to 3D\n\nAccording to Fukuyama, the appeal of the Blueprint is that it can support a wide range of creators, not just studios with big budgets.\n\n“The 3D Object Generation Blueprint is designed for a wide spectrum of creators, from freelance 3D artists and indie game developers to architects and product designers,” he told me.\n\nThe biggest benefit is speed. Instead of laboriously sourcing stock assets or blocking out rough placeholders, it's possible to generate objects instantly and start refining them.\n\n“An artist working on a ‘city street’ environment could instantly generate 20 candidate objects – benches, lampposts, storefronts, cars – and then decide which to refine. Instead of spending hours searching for stock assets or roughing in placeholders, the artist starts with usable prototypes and can devote more time to creative polish,” Fukuyama explains.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFor hobbyists still learning their way around the best 3D modelling software, this can be especially helpful, as it removes the technical bottleneck and lets you focus on the creative side.\n\nThe tech, explained\n\nSo what makes this possible? Nvidia has combined several different AI tools into one streamlined pipeline.\n\n“The Blueprint stitches together several Nvidia NIM microservices and models into a single pipeline,” Fukuyama says, before explaining (deep breath, here comes the tech): “A large language model powered by the Llama 3.1 8B NIM brainstorms object ideas and prompt inputs for Nvidia SANA Sprint, which generates high-resolution preview images of those objects. From there, the Microsoft TRELLIS NIM microservice converts the chosen previews into 3D assets, now accelerated by 20% thanks to PyTorch optimisations within the NIM. By packaging these components, the Blueprint removes the need for users to wire models together themselves and ensures performance is optimised on RTX GPUs.”\n\nLet me break it down. For creators, that means you don’t need to be an AI engineer to get results. Everything runs locally on an RTX GPU, so if you’ve already been shopping around for the best Nvidia graphics cards for your PC, you’re halfway there.\n\nUsable 3D models\n\nA major selling point of the Blueprint is that the models it produces aren’t just placeholders. They’re functional 3D assets you can drop straight into your workflow.\n\n“‘Fully usable’ refers to the fact that generated assets are starting points towards production, not just rough meshes or flat previews,” Fukuyama tells me. “The Microsoft TRELLIS model creates objects with geometry, textures, and materials that can be imported directly into Blender and other 3D applications. While artists may still want to adjust topology or refine textures for final projects, the output is beyond a placeholder; it’s an asset that can immediately populate a scene, test lighting setups, or serve as a foundation for further detailing.”\n\nFor hobbyists, that could mean skipping the grey boxes and getting textured models right away. For pros, it provides a faster base to build on.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nSupport for all 3D software\n\nBlender is the natural starting point for integration, but Nvidia hasn’t limited the Blueprint to one tool.\n\n“Blender is the starting point because it’s free, open source, and used by a huge range of creators,” Fukuyama says. “But the Blueprint exports assets in standard formats, so artists can move them into tools like Maya, Cinema 4D, or 3ds Max without extra steps.”\n\nThat makes it a useful companion to whichever 3D modelling software you prefer to work with. With so many new generative AI tools emerging, it’s worth asking: why choose this one? For Fukuyama, the key lies in performance and ease of use.\n\n“The differentiator is twofold: performance and packaging,” he says. “Many generative 3D tools exist, but they often require heavy setup, technical know-how, or cloud access. Nvidia AI Blueprints bring together proven models, pre-tuned pipelines, and NIM microservices that are optimised to run locally on RTX GPUs. That means creators get faster iteration – 20% faster with TRELLIS on RTX 50 Series – and keep full control of their data and workflows. By combining generative AI with RTX acceleration, we’re making professional-grade 3D workflows accessible to more creators, directly on their AI PCs and workstations.”\n\nThat local-first approach is especially appealing if you’re running your setup on one of the best laptops for 3D modelling, where GPU power and portability go hand in hand.\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nTime to try?\n\nFor anyone building 3D environments, the 3D Object Generation Blueprint is designed to take the grunt work out of the process. Whether you’re learning Blender at home or producing assets for a professional game, the promise is the same: more time for creativity, less time hunting for assets. (Read our Blender tutorials for more on how to get started.)\n\nAnd with Nvidia pushing to make its AI Blueprints run seamlessly on RTX GPUs, it’s clear the company is betting that these workflows will become essential tools for the next generation of digital artists, whether you’re experimenting with the best 3D software, starting in animation, or trying the best game development software to bring your ideas to life.\n\nVisit the Nvidia Blueprints website to learn more.",

            "headline": "Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti Super and RTX 5070 Super TDP leaked — long-rumored RTX 50 Super series GPUs appear in power supply calculator",
            "content": "Nvidia's mid-gen refresh for Blackwell is currently best rumored to launch next year at CES 2026. The RTX 50 Super series was recently caught up in the rumor mill, as some current-gen FE cards were delisted from the chipmaker's website, which was later confirmed to be a stock issue. Now, the informal chatter is set to reignite as Seasonic — a leading PSU manufacturer — has just listed a few RTX 50 Super models on its website, as part of its PSU calculator.\n\nVarious PC hardware companies have power supply calculators on their websites these days to not only help customers estimate the wattage they'll be pulling, but also to pick out an appropriate model subsequently. Hence, in these PSU calculators, one of the most crucial questions is that of the GPU: which graphics card would be in your system? For Seasonic, that list of potential nominees includes the unreleased and unannounced RTX 50 Super cards, at least two of which.\n\nSeasonic doesn't list the specs of a GPU beyond its TDP. Still, the RTX 50 Super series is rumored to feature 3 GB memory modules, effectively increasing the VRAM capacity by 50% while keeping the same number of chips onboard. That means the RTX 5070 Super would potentially have 18 GB (up from 12 GB on the 5070) of memory, and the 5070 Ti Super might rock 24 GB (up from 18 GB on the 5070 Ti), which would make them notable upgrades in what is otherwise a similar spec sheet.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nSeasonic states that the 5070 Super has a 275W TDP, which aligns with the leaked specs, as the additional 25W for the 6GB VRAM makes sense. The same goes for the 5070 Ti Super, which has a 350W TDP listed on the PSU calculator, a 50W increase over the standard 5070 Ti. The RTX 5080 Super is conspicuously missing from the website, but a 415W TDP has been leaked for it before. These numbers align with previous industry rumors, so Seasonic's not necessarily leaking anything new, but rather corroborating existing information.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 50 Super Series*\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Graphics Card GPU Die GPU Cores (CUDA) Memory (Capacity, bus) TDP Price RTX 5090 GB202-300 21,760 32 GB, 512-bit 575 W $2,000 RTX 5080 Super GB203-450 10,752 24 GB, 256-bit ~415 W TBD RTX 5080 GB203-400 10,752 16 GB, 256-bit 360 W $1,000 RTX 5070 Ti Super GB203-350 8,960 24 GB, 256-bit 350 W TBD RTX 5070 Ti GB203-200 8,960 16 GB, 256-bit 300 W $750 RTX 5070 Super GB205-400 6,400 18 GB, 192-bit 275 W TBD RTX 5070 GB205-300-A1 6,144 12 GB, 192-bit 250 W $550 RTX 5060 Ti GB205-300 4,608 8 / 16 GB, 128-bit 180 W $380 / $430 RTX 5060 GB206-250 3,840 8 GB, 128-bit 145 W $300\n\n*Specifications are unconfirmed.\n\nOf course, just because the RTX 50 Super series appears on a random PSU calculator doesn't mean it actually exists, but all signs do point toward it eventually being released. Unannounced GPUs appearing on PSU calculators is actually nothing new, so there's some credence to this model. Nvidia could be waiting till the first anniversary of the Blackwell launch to unveil its mid-gen refresh, which would be at CES next year. More substantial leaks from AIBs should start to emerge around that period, if such a launch is indeed planned.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

It's compatible with Windows, Android, UOS, Kylin, and other operating systems.\n\nThe GPU's memory configuration is well suited to AI applications and a single card is said to handle language models of up to 72B parameters, while systems with eight cards reportedly scale to 685B.\n\nThe company also claims compatibility with several Chinese-developed AI models, pointing to ambitions in the country’s domestic AI sector.\n\nInnosilicon claimed support for 8K resolution across six monitors, along with the YUV444 color format, a feature aimed at design and video professionals.\n\nChina has been working toward self-sufficiency in semiconductor technology, and products like the Fenghua No.3 is another example of this, although the card’s real-world performance remains to be seen.\n\nVia ITHome",

            "headline": "The big challenge to OpenAI's $100B deal with Nvidia: Access to power",
            "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThey've got the money and the chips. Now they need the power.\n\nNvidia announced Monday that it plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would give the ChatGPT maker a major leg up in the AI race — access to 10 gigawatts worth of the high-powered GPUs it needs to satisfy its mushrooming growth strategy.\n\nWhat the deal can't guarantee — and what neither company mentioned — is how OpenAI will access the enormous amount of electricity needed to fire up those chips.\n\n\"It is a huge hurdle to get access to power,\" said Benjamin Hertz-Shargel, head grid expert at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Monday's deal announcement, he added, is \"a far cry\" from a finished data center.\n\nThe deal, which the companies committed to in a letter of intent, highlights a growing constraint of the AI race: Access to electricity. The US power grid is already strained by an explosion of data center construction. Adding another 10 gigawatts of demand would amount to adding a power load nearly equivalent to New York City at its summer peak.\n\n\"Nationally, utilities are reporting the need for about 60 gigawatts of new power — six large cities' worth — to serve new data centers by the end of the decade,\" said Rob Gramlich, an energy policy consultant and founder of Grid Strategies.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment for this story, but its deal with Nvidia underscores the physical and financial challenges required to develop and commercialize AI. Beyond cutting-edge software, leaders must have access to chips, data centers, and the electricity needed to power that infrastructure.\n\n\"Infrastructure is critical to everything we do,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a joint interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on CNBC on Monday. \"Without doing this, we can't deliver the services people want.\"\n\nThe 'silent bottleneck'\n\nLimited access to power amid rampant data center growth is \"the silent bottleneck\" slowing the pace of Big Tech's ambitions for AI, said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology.\n\nData centers access electricity the same way everyone else does — by connecting to the power grid through public utility companies and paying them for service. However, connecting to the power grid can come with a slew of regulatory and financial hurdles that are only increasing as utilities struggle to keep up with skyrocketing demand.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThe surge in new service requests from data centers is so unprecedented that it has overwhelmed the country's major utilities and sparked a mad dash to build new infrastructure — a complex process that requires years of planning and regulatory approval.\n\nAs more data centers line up to connect, new development is being curbed. Commercial real estate services firm CBRE said that roughly 5.2 gigawatts of new data centers were underway in prime US markets in the first half of 2025, a 17.5% decline in the industry's construction pipeline from the same period a year prior, and that the limiting factor was power to light them up.\n\nAn additional 10 gigawatts of new demand adds even more pressure to an already strained system — and it represents only a slice of the electricity OpenAI will ultimately need to power its AI plans.\n\nIn July, OpenAI and Oracle announced they'd finalized plans to develop 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity, including a site in Abilene, Texas, that was announced in January as part of Stargate, a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on whether an official contract had been signed, but a spokesperson for the company said that the 10 gigawatts of demand announced Monday is new and is not accounted for in any of OpenAI's previously announced plans.\n\nWhile the media focuses on stock market fluctuations and the inner workings of tech companies, \"the industry is worried about power,\" said Gastwirth.\n\nBig Tech needs to 'get creative'\n\nIt's against this backdrop that access to electricity is gaining in value. One of the year's largest merger and acquisition deals in the data center sector has been imperiled because shareholders believe the takeover target is worth more, in part because of its access to power.\n\nThe US power grid, as it stands today, was built in the 1950s and 1960s. It was due for major upgrades before the data center development boom, but the AI race has made new power plants and power lines — and a lot of them — a more urgent necessity. The US Department of Energy has warned that the number of blackouts in the US could increase by 100 in 2030 if new power infrastructure is not built.\n\nSome data center operators have taken matters into their own hands, bypassing public utilities and going \"off grid\" to build their own on-site power plants. The first Stargate site in Abilene has done this with on-site natural gas turbines. Elon Musk has been powering his xAI data center in Memphis with natural gas generators for months, drawing ire from environmental and community activists who say they are a risk to air quality and public health.\n\nThe tech industry will have to \"get creative\" to solve the power problem, Gastwirth said. \"This is going to become a bigger and bigger issue as each year progresses.\"\n\nBig Tech companies have significantly ramped up investment in the energy sector, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into emerging technologies like hydrogen fuel cells and nuclear fusion. Amazon and Microsoft have signed deals to buy electricity from major industrial nuclear plants. Altman himself is a major investor in Oklo, a small modular reactor company that has, despite its pending regulatory approval, has already signed deals to power data centers.\n\nDespite the current challenges in accessing power, experts largely see OpenAI's deal with Nvidia as a smart strategic move, cementing the status of both companies as AI's leading players.\n\nSean Farney, executive director of data center strategy and innovation and Jones Lang Lasalle, said that Nvidia is the \"lead horse\" in the development of cutting-edge AI processors and that OpenAI's deal to secure that equipment was \"brilliant.\"\n\n\"It's the two leaders getting together to ensure that they will continue to be the leaders,\" Farney said.\n\nThe power problem, said Farney, will work itself out.\n\n\"They will find or self-source the power to make this happen. There's too much interest and dollar signs on this deal,\" he said.",

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAn executive order signed by President Donald Trump late Friday, hiking H-1B visa application fees to $100,000, sent Silicon Valley into a tailspin.\n\nH-1B visas have become a mainstay of the tech industry, allowing companies to hire highly-skilled workers from abroad, including engineers.\n\nAffected tech workers and corporate lawyers initially scrambled to decipher the new policies, with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta telling employees on H-1B visas to either stay in the US or return from abroad within 24 hours.\n\nThe Trump administration subsequently clarified that the fees would only apply to new applicants, not renewals or current H-1B holders.\n\nThe Trump administration said it implemented the changes to prevent system \"abuses\" and to encourage companies to train American workers.\n\nSome applauded the new policy, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings, who said it could mean the end of the lottery system, given H-1Bs are capped at 85,000 workers annually. Others worried cash-strapped startups would be most severely affected, or that the executive order could counterintuitively push more jobs out of the country.\n\nBusiness Insider examined publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to track which tech companies had the most H-1B visa approvals in 2025.\n\nBloomberg, Intel, and Nvidia declined to comment.

The first phase, one gigawatt, is scheduled for the second half of 2026 on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform, named for the late dark-matter astronomer.

By securing a long-term pipeline of Nvidia hardware, OpenAI seeks to guarantee its ability to keep pace with rivals like Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and Meta.\n\nFor Nvidia, the deal makes it more than just a supplier. By gradually taking a large stake in OpenAI, it positions itself at the center of the AI boom, buying into the biggest AI company.\n\n\"This is the biggest AI infrastructure project in history,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\nRead also: OpenAI Is Building a Teen-Friendly Version of ChatGPT\n\nThe completion of this deal will take years.

Top AI labs like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic frequently talk about this specific topic, especially when unveiling new products and features that cause a demand surge.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to keep up with this trend, NVIDIA recently announced its plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The strategic partnership will allow the ChatGPT maker to build at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters, which will help train and run next-gen AI models and even potentially create the path toward superintelligence.\n\nIt's worth noting that the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems is set to be deployed in the second half of 2026 on the Nvidia Vera Rubin platform. The chipmaker's first $10 billion investment in OpenAI will be made once both parties reach an agreement for OpenAI to purchase NVIDIA chips. However, reports suggest that NVIDIA's first $10 billion investment will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed.\n\nWhile making the announcement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated:\n\n“Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”\n\nAt the beginning of the year, OpenAI unveiled its $500 billion Stargate project, designed to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States to power its AI advances.

We're so limited right now in the services we can offer. There is so much more demand than what we can do.\"\n\nThe executive further elaborated that the compute constraints would place OpenAI in a tough spot within the next two years, forcing it to make painful tradeoffs.

Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nHello! Jim Cramer is known to take some heat for his stock picks, but it was his bashing of GameStop's 2021 meme rally that led him to hire a bodyguard.\n\nIn today's big story, Jimmy Kimmel returns to the late-night airways.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nMarkets: With rate cuts rolling in, are you wondering how to invest? Wall Street has some ideas.\n\nTech: Nvidia and OpenAI now have 100 billion reasons to help each other succeed.\n\nBusiness: There still isn't a deal to keep TikTok in the US, but here's what one could look like.\n\nBut first, give a big round of applause (or don't) for my next guest.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story\n\nKimmel's comeback\n\nRandy Holmes/ABC via Getty Images\n\nIt turns out \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" isn't going anywhere just yet.\n\nLess than a week after being suspended \"indefinitely\" over comments regarding Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel is scheduled to return to late-night television tonight.\n\n(If you're completely out of the loop, we recapped all the Kimmel drama and why it matters in Friday's newsletter.)\n\nIn a statement that probably went through more lawyers and PR people than I can count, Disney said it pulled Kimmel off the air \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.\" Kimmel's comments were \"ill-timed\" and \"insensitive,\" the House of Mouse added\n\nHowever, after some \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,\" Disney is bringing the show back.\n\nReactions from both ends of the spectrum quickly followed. Other late-night hosts welcomed his return. Some high-profile celebs and politicians celebrated the move as a win for free speech (California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Zohran Mamdani). Others felt Disney caved (Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet).\n\nKimmel's return comes with a slight caveat: Some viewers might still be unable to watch the show. That's because Sinclair, which played a key role in Kimmel's initial suspension, said it would not air the show on the 39 ABC affiliate stations it owns or controls.\n\nSinclair, which is the largest ABC affiliate, said it will air news programming instead and that discussions with ABC about the show's return are \"ongoing.\" Sinclair had issued a list of demands it wanted met before bringing the show back.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chair Brendan Carr referred BI to comments he made earlier Monday, in which he reiterated his agency's goal of trying to \"empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities.\"\n\nCarr, who last week said, \"This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" also pushed back on the idea that the FCC threatened to revoke Disney and ABC's licenses if they didn't fire Kimmel.\n\nIn the meantime, Disney finds itself in a tricky situation.\n\nOn the one hand, reinstating Kimmel is bound to make plenty of people happy. More than 400 celebrities signed a letter in support of Kimmel. There were also calls to boycott Disney due to the suspension.\n\nBut those who felt Kimmel's suspension was justified aren't likely to be happy about his return. (Whether they were supporters of Disney in the first place remains to be seen.) And even those who welcome Kimmel's return might still resent Disney for initially suspending him.\n\nAnd then there's the question of late night. The TV model for late-night shows was already fragile long before last week. But now that Kimmel and his show have become a lightning rod, any decision about the show going forward will be viewed with a magnifying glass and likely lead to more controversy.\n\n3 things in markets\n\nBank of America's Merrill and Wells Fargo are offering spot bitcoin ETF's to some of their clients as the investment vehicle surges in demand, Bloomberg Reported Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nCrypto prices tanked after hordes of traders rushed to liquidate their positions.

Nvidia and OpenAI are teaming up in an AI infrastructure deal that has the chipmaker investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI. This includes OpenAI constructing \"at least 10 gigawatts\" of AI data centers running Nvidia systems. Nvidia's stock jumped as much as 5% on news of the agreement, helping to push the S&P 500 to a fresh record high. And in case you're wondering how much $100 billion really is, BI's Katie Notopoulos puts things into perspective.\n\nThe jobs most — and least — likely to be transformed by generative AI. Indeed created the GenAI Skill Transformation Index to measure how generative AI will affect jobs or certain skills. From its findings, one overall message was clear: No job is totally immune, but not all jobs are equally exposed.\n\nThe H-1B fee is coming at a terrible time for Big Tech. IT outsourcing giants and tech companies were already navigating tariff threats, generative AI, and more. Now the new rules could upend their staffing models, according to analysts at TD Cowen who assessed the potential damage of Trump's new H-1B visa fee. Meanwhile, unionized Google employees held a press conference urging their employer to speak out against the matter.\n\n3 things in business\n\nTikTok (US version). The deal — which could land by the end of the week, according to the White House — could see a consortium of US investors, including Larry Ellison and potentially the Murdochs, buy TikTok's US assets. Post-sale, Oracle, which already serves as TikTok's data and security provider in the US, would also control TikTok's algorithm in partnership with the US government.\n\nMeet your new matchmaker: AI.

That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power.\n\nAs such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres.\n\nThe two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket.\n\nOnce this most recent deal is finalised, sources close to the company claim the plan is for Nvidia to invest an initial sum of $10 billion, followed by a hardware rollout sometime towards the end of 2026. The first gigawatt of power will likely take to the stage of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin AI compute platform, which was first revealed back in March.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a statement that it was all about maintaining a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded field, saying, \"Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.\"\n\nBut Nvidia spending money on OpenAI so OpenAI can then buy Nvidia hardware has raised some concerns; if this flow of cash looks a little circular to you, you're not the only one concerned about the potential shape of things to come.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon commented, \"On the one hand this [deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built. On the other hand the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Still though, the proposed 10 gigawatt data centres will demand power equivalent to the needs of 8 million U.S. households; despite Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's suggestion that AI customers 'pace themselves' and other major big tech players looking to nuclear to meet AI's power demands, there may come a time when such a power imbalance can no longer be ignored."

OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.\n\nUsers with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.\n\nHybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.\n\nOn Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.\n\nOther notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:\n\nOpt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)\n\nExperimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs\n\nAudio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc\n\n--disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed\n\nPlugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded\n\nBeyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.\n\nThough a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.\n\nHow to Install OBS Studio 32.0\n\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).\n\nOn Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.\n\nThere’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).\n\nTo install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\n\nThen, install OBS Studio using apt :\n\nsudo apt install obs-studio\n\nFinally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team."

            "headline": "Linux Kernel 6.17 Released, This is What’s New",
            "content": "EXT4 filesystem boosts – and changes to help SSDs last longer\n\nLinus Torvalds has announced the release of Linux kernel 6.17, an update that brings improved hardware support and a number of core system improvements.\n\nThe new kernel provides graphic drivers for the latest Intel ‘Panther Lake’ laptops, better power management features for devices with AMD hybrid GPUs, resolves a software bug that’s been knocking around since 1993, and helps SSDs last longer.\n\nAnnouncing the release on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), Linus Torvalds says: “No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go.”\n\nUbuntu 25.10 ships wit the new kernel, including in the beta build that was released last week. Users on the current long-term support release, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, will receive kernel 6.17 as part of the next hardware enablement (HWE) update in early 2026.\n\nIs this kernel a solid upgrade? You know it is! For a whip through the new features in Linux 6.17 which caught my eye, read on.\n\nLinux 6.17: What’s New?\n\nGraphics & Gaming\n\nAlienware’s ‘boost’ key (top row) gets a standardised keycode\n\nThe first Core Ultra Series 3 laptops powered by Intel ‘Panther Lake’ chips are due to go on sale soon, so it’s timely that Intel Xe3 integrated graphics are enabled by default in Linux 6.17. This ensures anyone bagging a new model and installing Ubuntu 25.10 gets solid graphics performance off the bat.\n\nSmartMux in 6.17 will switch between integrated and discrete graphics on AMD laptops\n\nFor those using laptops equipped with Core Ultra Series 2 (‘Lunar Lake’) chips, the Intel IPU7 driver has proper web camera support. Ideal for online meetings, social chats and accidental jump-scares when launching the camera app by accident.\n\nAMD hybrid GPU laptops gain SmartMux support with Linux 6.17. This auto-switches between integrated and discrete graphics based on workload to (obviously) save power or deliver maximum performance if needed.\n\nLenovo WMI Gaming Series Drivers add support for both Legion Go and the SteamOS-powered Legion Go S handheld, which will be especially handy for those looking to run other kinds of Linux-based operating systems on the AMD-powered handheld.\n\nThe kernel also standardises the keycode used by the (mysterious) “performance boost” key on newer Dell and Alienware laptops, and the (rather frutiger aero-looking) Flydigi Apex 5 game controller now has proper support on Linux — nice!\n\nOn a tangentially gaming-related note, the networking stack adds DualPI2 congestion control support. This helps to reduce network queue latency, which should prove beneficial for online gaming, streaming, video calls, and other real-time applications.\n\nFilesystem changes\n\nKernel write changes may help SSDs last longer\n\nThere are many filesystems improvements in 6.17 that will be directly appreciable by those of us running a desktop Linux distribution (not just the one this site is named after, either).\n\nUbuntu’s default file system is EXT4, and Linux 6.17 sees major performance boosts\n\nPerhaps most significant: the kernel can now write zeroes efficiently without actual I/O operations on NVMe SSDs that support the DEAC bit, and SCSI SSDs which support the UMMAP bit (a ‘bit’ is a kind of indicator of a feature state).\n\nThe FALLOC_FL_WRITE_ZEROES option for fallocate() will mark storage regions as zero-filled internally on modern SSDs. This will improve performance and reduce wear (SSDs theoretically have finite read/write lifespans, so fewer writes = lasts longer).\n\nUbuntu’s default filesystem EXT4 improves block allocation scalability. Per benchmarks, this provides noticeable performance benefits under I/O heavy tasks like querying databases or copying large numbers of files.\n\nBtrfs adds experimental large-folio support, which reduces memory management overhead when handling large files. This, combined with compression control during defragmentation, makes Btrfs better suited to performance-sensitive workloads.\n\nEROFS supports metadata compression and faster directory reading, which should prove especially handy on systems with read-only root filesystems or in container-heavy workloads. There’s no Bcachefs in the 6.17 merge reports…\n\nLaptop Support\n\nMacBook Pro touchbar becoming ever-more-functional in Linux\n\nLinux support on M1 and M2 Macs continues to improve in Linux 6.17, with the Apple Silicon SMC driver enabling ‘proper’ rebooting of M1 and M2 Macs. With work to run Linux on M3 and M4 Macs in limbo, it’s nice earlier gens are improving their mainline support.\n\nThe Touch Bar on Intel-based MacBook Pros see further improvements in Linux 6.17 with patches to enable touch screen input, albeit with a few lingering quirks. Apple ends support for Intel-based Macs after macOS 26, so Linux will give those devices a new lease of life.\n\nElsewhere, Linux 6.17 brings mainline support for ASUS Zenbook A14 Snapdragon X1 Plus/Elite laptops, allowing more Linux distributions to run on these ARM-based Windows devices. There’s also mainline support for Raspberry Pi 5’s RP1 I/O chip.\n\nGot a keyboard with F13-F24 keys? Those are now properly mapped in Linux 6.17\n\nSupport for Corsair HX1200i PSU monitoring (2025 model) is present; wake-on-touch support added to the Intel Touch Host Controller (along with overlay objects support, great for tablet and 2-in-1 users); and kernel mapping for F13 – F24 keys on PS/2 keyboards.\n\nYes, keyboards with an addition 12 function keys actually exist!\n\nHD Audio support is extended to cover the Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300, commercial ASUS laptops using CS35L41 HDA, and HP EliteBook models. USB audio offloading (a feature in Linux 6.xx) covers more mobile devices, including Fairphone 4.\n\nCore kernel changes\n\nNew Attack Vector Controls have been integrated to simplify security handling for known CPU vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown. Previously, each mitigation had its own kernel command-line option. In 6.17, there’s a unified option.\n\nMaking it easier for Linux server admins (and others) to disable unneeded protections may help them claw back performance dips certain mitigations require as well make it easier to manage the growing number of hardware vulnerability bandaids.\n\nSupport for uniprocessor configuration has been removed from the kernel scheduler. Every machine, even those which run on a single-core processor will now ‘unconditionally’ run a kernel designed for multicore systems.\n\nThis shouldn’t lead to any detrimental impact on single-core systems (not that many folks likely run one full-time in 2025), but adopting a unified scheduling approach across all CPUs should reduce code and make kernel behaviour more reliable.\n\nSpeed Boosts?\n\nLinux 6.17 picks up initial proxy execution support. This new kernel feature may speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when a high-priority application is waiting for a resource, the system temporarily gives the resource holder a boost, causing it to finish and release the resource faster.\n\nA new kernel feature could speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when high-priority tasks are waiting for a resource\n\nOr to word it the way kernel devs would, this resolves “priority-inversion problems” by enabling “high-priority tasks waiting for locks to donate execution context to lock holders”, which reduces latency spikes — slowdowns — in desktop apps.\n\nMemory management sees various optimisations across the kernel subsystems, notable with improved futex performance for heavily threaded applications (and more reliable crash kernel handling for debugging when things go wrong).\n\nAMD’s Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI) was added. Modern processors mix two types of cores: performance and efficiency. On AMD, HFI gives the kernel info to help it decide which core is better suited to which tasks, improving performance and power management.\n\nWeird Stuff\n\nLinux 6.17 removes the Pktcdvd packet-writing optical driver. It was deprecated in 2016, survived a removal attempt in 2023, but now, in 2025 optical packet-writing is definitively done and dusted! A loss for those who liked it, but a curio for those who’d never heard of it…\n\nThere’s also a bug fix for a kernel limitation dating back to 1993. It’s related to ELF program header handling that causes some applications in certain conditions to bug out. After 30 years, someone has finally bothered to fix it properly.\n\nOther Changes:\n\nBeyond the highlights above, some other notable changes in Linux 6.17:\n\nBPF subsystem adds standard string operations\n\nBPF programs have output and error streams for userspace communication\n\nExtended attributes support for pidfds\n\nNew DAMON_STAT kernel module for simplified memory activity monitoring\n\nTCP stack now enforces receive window limits more strictly\n\nASoC adds AMD ACP7.2 platform support\n\nKernel live patch support on 64-bit ARM\n\nTurbostat utility gains L3 cache topology display\n\nFor more detail on the release as whole read through the comprehensive merge report recaps (first half & second half) put out by the folks at LWN, or sift through the thousands of kernel commits on GitHub (grab a coffee before doing that, eh).\n\nUpgrade to Linux 6.17\n\nLinux 6.17 is available for download from kernel.org as source, but you will need to compile that source code by hand to make use of it — not for the faint of heart!\n\nUbuntu 25.10 includes Linux 6.17 by default, and the release will be back-ported to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS users in early 2026.\n\nIt will not be packaged for and uploaded to Ubuntu repositories for other supported releases officially, but it is possible to make use of Canonical Mainline DEBs or third-party PPAs unofficially — not without caveats, however.\n\nInstalling newer Linux kernels on Ubuntu from outside of the main repos comes with no guarantees and no support. They may lack Ubuntu-specific patches and drivers, not work in with some hardware or lack feature integrations.",

            "headline": "Linux 6.18 To Deliver Many Notable Features For AMD CPUs",
            "content": "There is a lot coming for AMD processors with the Linux 6.18 kernel. Of the early pull requests submitted in advance of the planned Linux 6.17 kernel release later today, there are a number of changes already lined up with some exciting AMD CPU feature additions for the next kernel version. These AMD changes for Linux 6.18 are all the more important with that kernel expected to become this year's Long Term Support (LTS) kernel version.First up, the EDAC pull request was already submitted in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window. Notable here are some new Family 26 (0x1a) additions to the AMD64 EDAC driver.The AMD64 Error Detection And Correction \"EDAC\" driver for Family 26 models 0xc0 to 0xc7 and 0x50 to 0x57 are now supported. These new IDs are likely for AMD EPYC Zen 6 \"Venice\" processors. The patch confirms those models support 16 channel memory compared to 12 channels with current generation AMD EPYC processors. So the next-gen EPYC processors should now have EDAC support with Linux 6.18 and the first to support 16 channel RAM.\n\nThe same patch also adds models 0x90 to 0x9f and 0xa0 to 0xaf to Family 26 for the AMD64 EDAC driver. Those models meanwhile max out with eight memory channels. With only eight channel support, perhaps these models are for the AMD EPYC 8004 \"Siena\" successor? EPYC 8004 supports six channel memory and we haven't heard much yet about AMD EPYC 8005 series but short of being for some new Threadripper PRO parts, that would be my guess for those eight channel Zen 5/Zen 6 parts.The x86/cpu pull request for Linux 6.18 meanwhile cleans up and corrects AMD CPU topology detection. With the x86/microcode pull request from AMD's Borislav Petkov are new microcode loader additions to help in debugging CPU microcode issues.\n\nWith the x86/cache pull request for Linux 6.18 is support on AMD EPYC processors for assigning QOS bandwidth counters to resources. This is about the AMD Assignable Bandwidth Monitoring Counters \"ABMC\" support . This code has long been going through review but is now ready for the mainline kernel.The x86/apic changes also are bringing some interesting work for AMD. There is now support for runtime firmware updates for the non-x86 parts of AMD platforms like for the security processor, modules, etc.That x86 APIC pull also includes Secure AVIC support for better security and performance in helping Secure Encryption Virtualization (SEV).Meanwhile over on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine \"KVM\" side there is code now ready for SEV-SNP CipherText Hiding. This is an opt-in SEV-SNP feature to prevent unauthorized CPU accesses from reading the cipher text of SNP guest private memory. This can help prevent offline attacks against AMD VMs using SEV-SNP on EPYC processors.Via this pull is also now enabling AVIC by default on Zen 4 CPUs and newer if x2AVIC is supported. Plus there is support for Secure TSC to prevent untrusted hosts from tampering with the guest's TSC frequency. That AMD Secure TSC support is another Linux kernel feature that's taken years to bake.The Linux 6.18 merge window hasn't even officially begun yet but already there is quite a bit on the AMD processor side for this next kernel cycle. Stay tuned to Phoronix for more details as the two week Linux 6.18 merge window gets underway. Linux 6.18 stable meanwhile should be out in December.",

            "headline": "Trump’s tariff‑shaped stick can’t beat reality on US chip fabbing",
            "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

This 2-way interleaved SHA-256 hashing is immediately used by the FS-VERITY module for faster file data verification.

            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. on Phaetrix Investing’s Substack by Phaetrix. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMD. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s share was trading at $159.79 as of September 22nd. AMD’s trailing and forward P/E were 95.68 and 26.88 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nBenchmark Rates Canaan Inc. (CAN) as a ‘Buy’ as Bitcoin Treasury Grows\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) presents a compelling 12–18 month investment opportunity, targeting 12–18% base case returns ($168–$177) and 20–25% upside ($180–$187) if Nvidia’s execution issues persist. While markets focus on AMD’s CPU gains, the company’s transformation into a diversified GPU powerhouse is underappreciated, particularly as Nvidia faces unprecedented reliability problems.\n\nAMD’s Q2 2025 results were strong, with 32% year-over-year revenue growth to $7.7 billion, driven by gaming revenue up 73% to $1.1 billion and data center revenue up 14% to $3.2 billion, signaling successful GPU diversification. Near-term margin pressure arose from export controls on MI308 accelerators, resulting in an $800 million inventory charge, but Wall Street forecasts support a 15–20% EPS CAGR through 2027.\n\nNvidia’s structural GPU reliability failures, including melted RTX 4090 connectors and boot issues with the RTX 5090/5080 series, create a rare competitive window, positioning AMD as a stable alternative. The RX 9070 XT demonstrates strong 1440p performance and improved power efficiency, while AMD’s open-source ROCm platform strengthens its data center positioning, despite export restrictions limiting near-term revenue. CPUs continue to provide stability, contributing roughly 50% of revenue and anchoring growth in consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nAMD’s potential market share gains in the $120 billion discrete GPU segment could generate $3.6–$6 billion in incremental revenue, though Nvidia’s ecosystem dominance and limited RDNA 4 portfolio constrain high-end capture. Macro risks, including Fed rate hikes or AI capex slowdown, could pressure valuations. Nonetheless, AMD’s diversified revenue streams, competitive GPUs, and proven data center scale support multiple expansion. Key risks include Nvidia’s rapid fixes, export control tightening, and semiconductor cyclicality. Overall, AMD offers a strong risk/reward profile, with Nvidia’s vulnerabilities and AMD’s execution creating meaningful upside potential.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) by StockOpine in May 2025, which highlighted strong Q1 revenue growth driven by Data Center and Ryzen processor sales, AI demand, and EPYC market share gains. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately 39% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as AMD’s diversified CPU and GPU business supports growth. Phaetrix shares a similar view but emphasizes Nvidia’s execution issues and AMD’s opportunity to gain GPU market share.",

But I do like having the option to go bright and brave with my next PC build.\n\nPC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\n\nFrom a company that specialised in plastering its cases with anime characters, the X50 is, somehow, its most ostentatious PC case yet. Let's just say it has a look, a strong look, and one crying out for an equally flashy build within. There's more to this case than a gaudy form; it's well suited to housing a pretty powerful PC in pink. If you don't mind paying a pretty penny—okay, I'll stop now.\n\nAvailable in Snow White (white), Pitch Black (black), Wild Cherry (red), Taro Milk (purple), Strawberry Milk (pink, as reviewed), and Matcha Milk (green), it's actually a pretty tough decision to choose between them all. To make your decision all the more difficult, it also comes in two variants: with a glass side panel (X50) or without (X50 Air). Oh, and the milk options come with little round feet, while the rest feature long, flat feet—decisions, decisions.\n\nNailed at $160 in the US, the X50 is not the cheapest case around, especially for the lack of any included fans. It is a little cheaper outside of the US, however, to the tune of around $10 or the local equivalent, as Hyte is still wrestling with price disruption from tariffs. The company had largely dropped prices back to pre-tariff pricing earlier in the year, though some cases remain inflated, and the X50 is seemingly one of those affected.\n\nThe X50 Air is considerably cheaper than the X50 for its perforated side panel, to match the front and rear side, at the equivalent of $120 worldwide or $130 in the US.\n\nHyte X50 specs (Image credit: Future) Form factor: Mid-tower\n\nDimensions: 51.3 x 25.7 x 51.7\n\nMotherboard support: Up to E-ATX\n\nMax GPU length: 430 mm\n\nMax CPU cooler height: 170 mm\n\nFan support: Up to 3x 140 mm (front), up to 3x 120 mm (side), up to 3x 120 mm (bottom), up to 1x 120 mm (rear)\n\nFront IO: 2x USB 3.2 (5 Gbps) Type-A ports, 1x USB 3.2 (20 Gbps) Type-C port, audio jack\n\nStorage support: 2x 2.5-inch, 1x 3.5-inch\n\nPrice: $150 (worldwide, equivalent to), or $160 in the US; X50 Air $120 (worldwide, equivalent to), or $130 in the US\n\nThe X50 is not hugely price competitive with other similar sized chassis. The cases that Hyte has cherry-picked to compare it to include some amount of fans pre-installed, such as the Lian Li Lancool III or NZXT H7 Flow, whereas the X50 does not. So that's an added cost here. I can go one further with the cases I've personally reviewed in recent months, such as the Phanteks Eclipse G400A at $110 and Asus ProArt PA401 at $130—both good-looking cases with fans included for less—or the Corsair Frame 4000D at $95 with no fans included but a much lower price tag.\n\nYou can pick up colour-matched fans from Hyte, specifically the FA12, available in a handy four-pack for $40. I have eight of these in Strawberry Milk for testing, or $80 worth. They perform pretty great in terms of pure airflow through the rpm range, which means they're easy enough to tune to lower speeds and noise levels with a fan curve while maintaining admirable performance. You're going to want to do that, too, as they are pretty loud at top speed (which is only a tepid 1500 rpm).\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nOnto the case proper, and it's a fairly small chassis by today's standards. I measure it at 51.3 x 25.7 x 51.7 cm (H x W x L). Definitely desktop-sized if you wanted to store it in plain view atop of your desk, which seems likely with a case so bulbous and, er, I wanna say eye-catching?\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThere's a gorgeous curve to the windowed side panel on the X50, reaching from the side panel, up and over two thirds of the top of the case, stretching all the way over to the IO panel with two USB 3.2 (5 Gbps) Type-A ports and a single USB 3.2 (20 Gbps) Type-C port. This panel slides up and off—the rear panel works the same way—which keeps the exterior of the case clear of any screws. You'll want to keep a cloth close by to get rid of any fingerprints on the glass, however, as you will likely have to handle the glass to get it fitted back into place.\n\nThe front panel has a perforated finish and only gives way slightly under pressure. Altogether, it feels really solid, as does the rest of the case, thanks to some clever venting on the rear IO that Hyte calls 'Louvered Blade Ventilation'. The front panel also doubles as a dust filter, which is to say, there's no filter underneath. Dust should be collected on that outer surface, meaning it likely only needs a quick wipe down every so often, though I've not had the case for long enough to really test it out for myself.\n\nImage 1 of 8 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nThis front panel reduces airflow to the innards (with front-mounted fans) by around 0.6 m/s—which is a somewhat significant amount but not totally unusual for a case in my own testing. The same reduction applies to the rear side panel, too, which is important if you plan to stick any fans besides the motherboard.\n\nThis case has plenty of room for fans. We're spoiled for choice. There's space for up to 3x 120/140 mm fans in the front of this chassis, 3x 120 mm to the side of the motherboard, and another 3x 120 mm in the bottom. The bottom also includes a magnetic dust filter attached to the outside of the case. Then there's 1x 120 mm in the rear for exhaust.\n\nFor my test build, I opted first for what I thought would be the most beneficial layout for airflow: three intake fans in the front, three intake fans in the bottom, and one exhaust fan in the rear. Though, being such a good guy, I've also tested other likely configurations. Here are the results:\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Average temp | Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition | 1080p Row 0 - Cell 0 GPU (°C, average) CPU (°C, average) Front/bottom intake 60 66 Front intake only 62 66 Side/bottom intake 61 66 Side intake only 62 67 Bottom intake/side exhaust 61 66 Bottom intake only 60 67\n\nTest build\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7900X | Motherboard: Gigabyte X870 Aorus Elite WiFi 7 Ice | RAM: Crucial Pro 64 GB DDR5-6000 | SSD: Biwin X570 Pro | Graphics card: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Eagle | Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 612 Apex | PSU: Corsair RM850x\n\nAfter the sixth test with near-enough the exact same results, I called it. You can't really go too wrong here, as nearly every config landed me within a few degrees of any other. Though for a smashing appearance, I'd argue for three intake fans in the bottom, three to the side of the motherboard, and one as exhaust out the rear. It's just a shame Hyte doesn't sell reverse versions of the FA12 fans, as it'd look a lot better with all the fans facing inwards. The backside of the FA12 is pretty ugly, which is a shame for a case so prepossessing.\n\nThere's no room in the top of the case for a liquid cooler's radiator, as that's taken up by the power supply. You're better off mounting it to the side of the motherboard, which isn't too far to go for most liquid coolers in this compact case, with the fans exhausting out of the back panel.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nI can see why Hyte has chosen the top-mounted PSU here, as the case would have to be made wider to make room for one in the rear chamber or risk cutting off height to the CPU cooler, of which mine only just fits already. Though I'm not a huge fan of the end result. It feels pretty retro, which isn't out of character for the case, but it also blocks a good part of the windowed side panel and feels a little out of place above the motherboard. Maybe if the lower edge was more rounded to give a floating appearance I'd be more into it?\n\nThat said, the main issue with this approach is cable length. The Corsair RM850x PSU I'm using here has a native 12V-2x6 connector that only just reaches from the PSU, round the back of the case, through to the front, and then underneath the graphics card. And you really want this connection to be secure and, if possible, not at a weird angle. I couldn't really manage that here, due in part to the length of my cable and also the position of the PSU.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nBuy if... ✅ You can't stand a boring black box: I get it, cases can be pretty dull, and this is one way to have something that stands out without any RGB lighting.\n\nDon't buy if... ❌ You want the best value: With no fans as standard, you could save a pretty penny (there I go again) on an admittedly more boring-looking PC case.\n\nHyte includes plenty of velcro straps to tidy up cables in the rear of the case, with extras included in the box. There are no cable management channels, however, and the approach is a bit minimal compared to some modern cases. The cables are covered up with excellent colour-matched rubber grommets leading to the front-side of the case. All except the cutout below the motherboard, which looks a bit slapdash as a result.\n\nThe X50 might be cutesy and compact but it offers wide compatibility for cooling and components. In that sense, it's not form over function like some eye-catching alternatives. But it's not objectively pretty, either. I've asked around our team and it fell a bit flat, even with the members of the team that enjoy some of Hyte's weebier cases. But you might be more susceptible to its charm than any of us.\n\nThe Hyte X50 dares to do differently in a world of pretty plain boxes that let RGB lighting effects do all the heavy lifting for them. It's the antithesis of most cases today: bright, colourful, retro, and rounded. I feel like some builders will be very into it, but most won't. It could be stunning as a part of a wider themed cozy desktop, or it could look out of place alongside more serious kit. It seems to be a perfect base for modding and further personalisation, but that depends on who gets their hands on it.",

            "content": "Thirteen years after the AMD GCN 1.0 \"Southern Islands\" GPUs initially launched as the Radeon HD 7000 series, recently there has been an effort to improve the support for both GCN 1.0 and the GCN 1.1 graphics processors with their open-source Linux driver stack. This recent effort has been led by one of the developers on Valve's Linux graphics team.As noted back in July, a Valve Linux engineer has been working on big improvements for old AMD Radeon GPUs from the GCN 1.0 and GCN 1.1 generations. By default those GPUs use the older \"Radeon\" Linux kernel graphics driver rather than the newer \"AMDGPU\" kernel graphics driver used by GCN 1.2 and all newer AMD Radeon/Instinct hardware.Using the AMDGPU kernel driver is important for RADV Vulkan, various performance optimizations, and all around better support compared to the legacy Radeon driver that rarely sees any significant improvements these days. But for making GCN 1.0/1.1 more suitable for AMDGPU, Valve contractor Timur Kristóf has been working to enhance the AMDGPU DC display support for these GPUs and other fixes/adjustments.\n\n\"This series has a few minor patches to address some SI issues.\n\n\n\nWhen a 4K 60Hz display is connected to Tahiti or Pitcairn there is a slight flickering near the bottom of the display. Disabling MCLK switching fixes that. (Other SI parts are likely affected too, but I didn't test them thoroughly enough to say.)\n\n\n\nWhen enabling ASPM on Zen 4 with Tahiti and Oland, there are random hangs when the GPU usage is low. Disabling ASPM fixes that. At the moment I don't know if this is a platform-specific or GPU-specific issue and I don't think we can reasonably determine that without spending more time than we have. (Other SI parts may be affected, but I didn't test them for a long enough time to judge that.)\n\n\n\nFinally, there is a DC patch to change the minimum PLL dividers to the same value as the legacy non-DC display code. This doesn't fix any visible issue but I think it's still good to have just in case.\"\n\nSome of those patches from Timur are queued up for merging to the Linux 6.18 kernel while on Friday some additional work was posted. The new patches are to address some issues Timur observed recently with AMDGPU on GCN 1.0 Southern Islands hardware. He commented on the patch series The code is now on the mailing list awaiting review.",

            "content": "Audio By Carbonatix\n\nMost cars are getting smarter. But is your car smart enough to make fun of you?\n\nTesla drivers know that every time you turn on your car, you might be greeted with a surprise. Sometimes, these surprises aren’t the best. But other times, you’ll turn on your electric vehicle and be greeted by a brand-new piece of software that can make your driving experience more enjoyable.\n\nOne update recently pushed to Tesla vehicles was the addition of the artificial intelligence chatbot Grok, a product of Elon Musk’s company xAI. One user recently shared her experience talking with the chatbot, and it didn’t go great.\n\nWhat Did This Tesla Chatbot Say To A Woman Who Just Crashed Her Car?\n\nIn a video with over 156,000 views, TikTok user Christine (@christinedalenn) shows the infotainment screen on her Tesla.\n\nShe prompts it to repeat what it last said, describing it as “rude and uncalled for.” At this point, the car goes into the following diatribe:\n\n“Night, you whiny little s—. Get some sleep, and maybe dream of a world where you don’t crash into horse trailers. This dumb b—- will be here ready to roast your a– when you wake up. Sweet f—— dreams, Tacoma style. Shove some sheep under your pillow for extra chaos. You want me to be rude again for your video? I’ll crank it up, you sensitive f—–. How about this? I’ll call you a tire-humping, [unintelligible] trailer-banging crybaby. … Record that. Post it, and let’s go viral, you Tacoma tornado. Want me to keep going, or what?”\n\nChristine responds that she’s “done” and thanks the car.\n\n“No problem, you glorious f— up. Now go record that video before you crash into another trailer in your dreams. Need me to spit more fire for the ‘gram, or you good?” the car continues.\n\nDo All Tesla Vehicles Do This?\n\nWhile many in the comments were entertained by this interaction, some wondered how it was possible—or if it was normal for Tesla vehicles to talk to their drivers in this manner.\n\nThe answer is that the Grok is currently only available in certain Tesla models, though Musk claims it will one day be rolled out to all models.\n\nAs for why Christine’s car was swearing at her, this is a feature of Grok. Tesla drivers can decide how they want Grok to speak to them. For example, there’s a “storyteller” mode that will make Grok more verbose and descriptive. There’s also an “Unhinged” mode where Grok will swear and make suggestive remarks. This is likely the mode being used by Christine.\n\nHow Do I Activate Grok In My Tesla?\n\nIf you have a Tesla and want it to swear at you, or if you’d just like an AI assistant in your car, it’s easy to use Grok in your car.\n\nFirst, you have to make sure that your car meets Grok’s current requirements. This includes having an AMD processor, running vehicle software version 2025.26 or later, and having Premium Connectivity or a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nTesla owners can enable Grok by opening the App Launcher and selecting “Grok” or by holding the voice button on their steering wheel. That said, the software is currently in beta and doesn’t control the vehicle. Existing voice commands for the vehicle still work as before.\n\nCommenters Aren’t Sure\n\nIn the comments section, users weren’t exactly sure what to make of this software.\n\n“Imagine having the worst day of your life only for your car just to rub it in your face,” wrote a user.\n\n“Don’t get a tesla. they verbally abuse you,” declared another.\n\n“Yup getting a Tesla just to argue with it,” shared a third.\n\n“This the stuff that makes me want a tesla,” offered a further TikToker.\n\nBroBible reached out to Tesla and Christine via email.",

            "headline": "Investors Heavily Search Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Here is What You Need to Know",
            "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Advanced Micro falls in, has gained 14.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAdvanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.3%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.9 indicates a change of +49.4% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.",

Impact Link\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nCitadel's CEO said it was \"anti-American\" for President Donald Trump to give big companies tariff relief.\n\nKen Griffin, the billionaire CEO and founder of the hedge fund, criticized Trump during a Thursday CNBC interview.\n\n\"Is that our country, that we're going to favor the big and the connected? That's not the American story,\" Griffin said to CNBC.\n\n\"When the state becomes involved in picking winners and losers, there's only one way this game ends: All of us lose,\" he said.\n\nHis comments come after Trump said in August that he would impose a 100% tariff on the import of semiconductors, but companies that promised to invest in the US would be exempt from it.\n\nIn the same month, Apple announced that it would invest $100 billion in its US facilities, in addition to the $500 billion it pledged in February.\n\nTrump also allowed American chip giants like Nvidia and AMD to sell some chips to China if they agreed to grant the US government a 15% cut of their China revenue.\n\n\"The line outside the White House of every business arguing why they should be exempt from paying tariffs on what they import into their products is nauseating,\" Griffin said to CNBC.\n\nGriffin has previously weighed in on the Trump administration's economic policies.\n\nIn September, Griffin co-authored an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal, in which he criticized Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump has been pressuring Fed chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates for months.\n\n\"Congress has a duty to oversee the Fed, and this oversight must be free of undue interference from the executive branch,\" Griffin wrote in the opinion piece.\n\nRepresentatives for Griffin at Citadel did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

PNY's RTX 5080 is also enjoying a massive discount, coming in at $929 or $70 below MSRP.\n\nThere are more options to check out, and I've also added an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D deal for those going for a CPU and GPU upgrade at the same time.\n\nBest NVIDIA GPU deals at or below MSRP\n\nRTX 5080 Save 15% ($170) PNY GeForce RTX 5080 OC: was $1,099 now $929 at Walmart The mighty RTX 5080 is the GPU that most enthusiasts want for a stellar gaming experience, and up until now, it's been hard to find at MSRP, never mind $70 below the $999 price set by NVIDIA. 💰 $70 below $999 NVIDIA MSRP 👉 See at: Walmart.com Read more ▼\n\nRTX 5090 Save 29% ($800.99) PNY GeForce RTX 5090 OC: was $2,799.99 now $1,999 at Walmart The RTX 5090 is the most powerful GPU in the world right now, and it's not been easy to find at a price anywhere near MSRP. That changes now with this PNY OC version available for $800 less than the usual price. 💰 Matches the $1,999 NVIDIA MSRP 👉 See at: Walmart.com Read more ▼\n\nBonus CPU deal: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nAMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU in the world. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)\n\nAMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU you can buy right now, and it's currently 10% off at Walmart and Amazon.\n\nWhile it might be a tad overkill for the lower-end NVIDIA RTX GPUs, it'll make a perfect pairing for the RTX 5070 (or Ti), RTX 5080, or RTX 5090.\n\nWhat is Walmart's GeForce Week? Walmart and NVIDIA have teamed up to deliver a wide range of discounts on all types of hardware, including gaming laptops, desktops, monitors, accessories, and PC components. If it's from NVIDIA, there's a good chance that it's on sale this week at Walmart. Be sure to have a look at my top picks for GeForce Week gaming laptop deals, which I've rounded up in a separate collection.\n\nWhen does Walmart's GeForce Week begin? Walmart's GeForce Week is already underway, having kicked off on September 22, 2025.\n\nWhen does Walmart's GeForce Week end? Walmart's GeForce Week is expected to conclude on September 28, 2025 at midnight.

            "headline": "HP EliteBook 8 G1a review: AMD’s hardware shines",
            "content": "At a glance Expert's Rating Pros Great combination of CPU performance and battery life\n\nPremium build quality\n\nRuns Copilot+ PC features with full x86 app compatibility\n\nNice keyboard Cons HP should upgrade this display\n\nMany G1a models aren’t Copilot+ PCs\n\nGPU performance lags\n\nUnimpressive speakers Our Verdict The HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a Copilot+ PC with an excellent mix of CPU performance and battery life. It’s a solid package, but the display drags down the experience, and the GPU just can’t keep up with the rest of the hardware. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today\n\nBest Prices Today: HP EliteBook 8 G1a\n\nRetailer Price $1,819.31 View Deal Product Price\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a 16-inch Copilot+ PC laptop aimed at businesses and professionals. It has an AMD CPU, so it marries a speedy CPU with a neural processing unit that can deliver Copilot+ PC features on some models. Plus, unlike a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Arm PC, this is a traditional x86 PC that is guaranteed to run existing business apps and drivers that may not run perfectly on an Arm PC.\n\nBut, although HP proudly markets this as a “next-generation AI PC,” it’s not just about AI features. Overall, it’s a solid laptop that most people would be happy to use for work, although the display doesn’t keep pace with the rest of the experience.\n\nHP recently redesigned its product names, and the EliteBook is HP’s line of laptops aimed at business users. The 8 Series is the entry-level line of EliteBooks, and the “G1a” here means this is a first-generation model in the new lineup with an AMD CPU.\n\nOverall, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a shows how strong AMD’s offerings are right now: Solid CPU performance and an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features at a very competitive price.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Specs\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has an AMD Ryzen AI processor — our review model included AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 hardware. That’s an x86 processor with a 50 TOPS NPU for AI features. However, it’s worth noting that not all the models have an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features. HP has a variety of G1a models, and machines like the base AMD Ryzen 5 230 machine deliver up to 16 TOPS. That means they can’t run Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC features and, if your business does have an NPU-powered AI application, it’ll run much slower than on the models with faster NPUs.\n\nBut the processor isn’t the only thing that differs from machine to machine. HP offers a range of configuration options during the purchase process, so you can get a model that’s very different from the below specs.\n\nOur review model had AMD Radeon 860M graphics. While AMD produces a lot of strong discrete GPUs, this is still integrated graphics and it’s not particularly fast.\n\nThe RAM in this machine is user-upgradable and swappable, which is great to see on a business laptop. (The Intel-powered EliteBook 8 G1i I reviewed at the same time has soldered RAM.)\n\nModel number: HP EliteBook 8 G1a 16-inch\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a 16-inch CPU: AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350\n\nAMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 Memory: 32GB DDR5 RAM\n\n32GB DDR5 RAM Graphics/GPU: AMD Radeon 860M\n\nAMD Radeon 860M NPU: AMD NPU Compute Accelerator Device (up to 50 TOPS)\n\nAMD NPU Compute Accelerator Device (up to 50 TOPS) Display: 16-inch 1920×1200 IPS display with 60Hz refresh rate\n\n16-inch 1920×1200 IPS display with 60Hz refresh rate Storage: 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD\n\n512GB PCIe NVMe SSD Webcam: 1440p webcam\n\n1440p webcam Connectivity: 2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C 40 Gbps), 1x USB Type-C (10 Gbps), 1x HDMI 2.1 out, 1x combo audio jack, 1x security lock slot, 1x USB Type-A (5 Gbps)\n\n2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C 40 Gbps), 1x USB Type-C (10 Gbps), 1x HDMI 2.1 out, 1x combo audio jack, 1x security lock slot, 1x USB Type-A (5 Gbps) Networking: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4\n\nWi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Biometrics: Fingerprint reader and IR camera for facial recognition\n\nFingerprint reader and IR camera for facial recognition Battery capacity: 77 Watt-hour battery\n\n77 Watt-hour battery Dimensions: 14.13 x 9.84 x 0.61 inches\n\n14.13 x 9.84 x 0.61 inches Weight: 3.73 pounds\n\n3.73 pounds MSRP: $1,799 as tested\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Design and build quality\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe 16-inch HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a premium-feeling metal chassis in a “Glacial Silver” color. At 3.73 pounds, it’s a little heavier than some laptops, but it feels solid and durable thanks to that metal build.\n\nThe design here is minimal: Dark gray keyboard, black bezel, and silver metal elsewhere. There are a few HP logos (on the lid and just below the screen) and that’s about it. The hinge feels good to use, although I had to use a second hand to hold down the front of the laptop while opening it. It’s a solid hinge and the screen doesn’t move around while you type.\n\nHP bundles HP Wolf security with this machine, and that will be convenient for businesses who want to remotely manage this laptop in a fleet. As an individual knowledge worker, however, I didn’t like the end-user experience. I had to click through extra security dialogs to run PCWorld’s normal benchmark tools, for example — many people will want to disable this, or businesses will want to tune it so it doesn’t nag employees about their business apps.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Keyboard and trackpad\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a full-size keyboard complete with a number pad. It’s spacious and feels like it has a good amount of key travel — more than the 13-inch HP EliteBook 8 Flip G1i I reviewed at the same time. It’s quiet and doesn’t click with the snap of a mechanical keyboard, but it’s still snappy. This is a good keyboard that you can get a lot of typing done on. But I always wish the arrow keys on laptops were full-size.\n\nThis machine has a large trackpad that feels smooth to glide your finger over and clicks down with a clean “thunk.” I would prefer seeing a haptic touchpad, but this trackpad is solid. This isn’t a glass trackpad — those feel smoother, but those are premium touches reserved for higher-end laptops. Both the keyboard and trackpad are fairly quiet, which is important for a business laptop.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Display and speakers\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a 16-inch 1920×1200 IPS display with a 60Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of brightness. That’s just nothing special, and that resolution stings on a 16-inch display, especially one in this price range. It’s an anti-glare display, which is nice to see. But HP offers the base model with 300 nits of brightness, which I’d recommend avoiding.\n\nHP does offer a variant of this laptop with a 2560×1600 display with a 120Hz variable refresh rate, and I’d love to see what that machine looks like. But it likely won’t have as much battery life and it’ll be more expensive.\n\nThe display here is the one feature that feels the most lacking on this laptop, especially compared to consumer laptops in a similar price range.\n\nThe stereo speakers on this machine are okay for a business laptop but, like the display, they feel more serviceable than special. They can get pretty loud, and the sound is clear, but the audio lacks some depth. They’ll do a fine job in video meetings. I test each laptop I review by playing Steely Dan’s Aja and Daft Punk’s Get Lucky. The instrument separation in Aja was reasonable, but a lot of the high notes weren’t particularly crisp. In Get Lucky, the sound was reasonably fun, but more bass would’ve been nice. Pack a good pair of headphones for music.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Webcam, microphone, biometrics\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a 1440p webcam. Business laptops tend to have solid webcams, so I was expecting a bit more here. It’s nothing special for a business laptop: It’s a little noisy and seems to do much better in ideal lighting. This is the kind of webcam that will look fine in a business meeting, but you’ll want to get an external webcam if you’ll be recording videos for YouTube or social media. HP also built in a privacy shutter above the display, and you can slide it to block the webcam.\n\nThe dual-array microphone setup in this machine was clear and did a good job of removing background noise. It’s solid for a business laptop, but it’s not particularly high-end. If you’re participating in meetings all day and you want the best voice quality possible, you may still want an external mic.\n\nThe EliteBook 8 G1a has both facial recognition hardware and a fingerprint reader in the power button on the keyboard. You can use Windows Hello to sign into Windows with either your fingerprint or your face, and both work well.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Connectivity\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a offers a good number of ports, including three USB Type-C ports and two of them are Thunderbolt 4 ports.\n\nOn the left side, this laptop has an HDMI 2.1 out port, two Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C 40 Gbps) ports, and a combo audio jack. On the right side, there’s a third USB Type-C port (10 Gbps), a USB Type-A (5 Gbps) port, and a security lock slot.\n\nSince each side of the laptop has a USB Type-C port, you can plug this laptop’s USB-C charger into other side of the laptop. That’s the kind of thing that’s easy to overlook on a spec sheet but makes the laptop much nicer to use in the real world.\n\nYou can also get models of this laptop with optional extra ports: RJ-45 Ethernet, a Smart Card reader, and a nano SIM card slot for cellular connectivity. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have an SD card reader option.\n\nOur review unit had future-proof Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 wireless networking, and I had no problems with it.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Performance\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor, and it performed well in web browsers, communication apps, productivity tools, and the apps you’d run on a Windows desktop.\n\nAs always, though we ran the HP EliteBook 8 G1a through our standard benchmarks to see how it performs.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nFirst, we run PCMark 10 to get an idea of overall system performance. With an overall PCMark 10 score of 7,605, this AMD-powered machine surpassed similar laptops with recent Intel Core Ultra processors. (And, as we’ll see below, it had similar battery life.)\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nNext, we run Cinebench R20. This is a heavily multithreaded benchmark that focuses on overall CPU performance. It’s a quick benchmark, so cooling under extended workloads isn’t a factor. But, since it’s heavily multithreaded, CPUs with more cores have a huge advantage.\n\nWith a multithreaded Cinebench R20 score of 6,160, the AMD hardware here ran faster than Intel Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake chips.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nWe also run an encode with Handbrake. This is another heavily multithreaded benchmark, but it runs over an extended period. This demands the laptop’s cooling kick in, and many laptops will throttle and slow down under load.\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a completed the encode process in an average of 924 seconds — that’s over 15 minutes. This machine can put out some serious CPU performance when it needs to, and it’s a good compromise of performance and power efficiency.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nNext, we run a graphical benchmark. This isn’t a gaming laptop, but it’s still good to check how the GPU performs. We run 3DMark Time Spy, a graphical benchmark that focuses on GPU performance.\n\nWith a 3DMark Time Spy score of 3,052, the AMD Radeon 860M graphics in this machine weren’t particularly impressive. It’s slower than Intel’s Arc graphics and is on the lower end for AMD’s graphics hardware.\n\nTo be honest, I think most people — including business users — would prefer a laptop with a faster GPU. Lots of businesses use GPU-accelerated tools. I’d prefer to see a faster GPU here, even at the expense of NPU features.\n\nOverall, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a shows how strong AMD’s offerings are right now: Solid CPU performance and an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features at a very competitive price. But this machine cuts a corner when it comes to the GPU, and anyone who uses a GPU-accelerated professional application will want to look elsewhere.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Battery life\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a has a 77 Watt-hour battery, which is a good size for a 16-inch laptop. It delivered a good combination of battery life and performance.\n\nFoundry / Chris Hoffman\n\nTo benchmark the battery life, we play a 4K copy of Tears of Steel on repeat on Windows 11 with airplane mode enabled until the laptop suspends itself. We set the screen to 250 nits of brightness for our battery benchmarks. This is a best-case scenario for any laptop since local video playback is so efficient, and real battery life in day-to-day use is always going to be less than this.\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a lasted an average of 936 minutes in our benchmarks — that’s nearly 16 hours. While you’ll get less in day-to-day computer use, this is likely enough juice for all-workday battery life, which is what really matters for a business laptop.\n\nHP EliteBook 8 G1a: Conclusion\n\nThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a combines a premium metal build quality with AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 hardware. In many ways, the result is an excellent, well-balanced machine.\n\nAMD’s chips are highly underrated right now. They don’t match the CPU performance you’ll find in a high-end workstation or the battery life you’ll find in a thin-and-light laptop, but they offer an excellent mix of both. Plus, this delivers an NPU fast enough for Copilot+ PC features, so the AI features here aren’t just marketing. If apps ever start taking more advantage of NPUs, you’ll want a fast one like the 50 TOPS NPU here — not the 12 TOPS NPU Intel is still delivering in most PCs.\n\nBut this isn’t the be-all, end-all business laptop. The display drags down the overall experience, and the graphics performance just isn’t up there with the CPU and NPU performance. While it’s a good laptop, it’s not the right pick for everyone. But I’m happy my review model had AMD hardware, and I think you’d prefer the AMD hardware here to Intel’s current offerings, too.",

            "timestamp": "2025-09-23",
            "content": "Following our review of their recent RV2 RISC-V board, OrangePi has offered us to review one of their latest ARM64 based hardware, the OrangePi 5 Ultra. This is currently their highest specs ARM64 SBC.\n\nSo what can we expect from the OrangePi Pi 5 Ultra board ? Let’s go through the specs first.\n\nSpecs\n\nThe board is fairly small in size, very close to what you get with the Raspberry Pi.\n\nFeature Specifications Master Chip Rockchip RK3588 (8nm LP process) CPU • 8-core 64-bit processor\n\n• 4 Cortex-A76 and 4 Cortex-A55 with independent NEON coprocessor\n\n• Cortex-A76 at 2.4GHz, Cortex-A55 at 1.8GHz GPU • Integrated ARM Mali-G610\n\n• Built-in 3D GPU\n\n• Fully compatible with OpenGL ES1.½.0/3.2, OpenCL 2.2 and Vulkan 1.2 NPU Embedded NPU supports INT4/INT8/INT16/FP16 hybrid computing with up to 6TOPS PMU RK806-1 RAM LPDDR5 496PIN: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB optional Memory • eMMC flash socket\n\n• eMMC IC\n\n• Note: Either eMMC flash socket or eMMC IC, supports: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, 256GB optional\n\n• QSPI NOR flash: 16MB\n\n• MicroSD card slot\n\n• M.2 M-KEY slot: supports NVMe SSD (PCIe 3.0 4Lane) USB 2 × USB3.0; 2 × USB2.0 Video • 1 × HDMI 2.1 output up to 8K@60FPS\n\n• 1 × HDMI 2.0 input up to 4K@60FPS\n\n• 1 × MIPI DSI TX 4 Lane Camera • 2 × MIPI CSI 4 Lane\n\n• 1 × MIPI D-PHY RX 4 Lane Audio CODEC: ES8388\n\n• 1 × Audio 3.5mm jack with mic\n\n• 1 × MIC In\n\n• 1 × HDMI 2.1 eARC Ethernet 1 × PCIe 2.5G LAN (RTL8125BG) Wi-Fi + BT Module Onboard Wi-Fi 6E + BT 5.3/BLE module: AP6611\n\n• Wi-Fi interface: SDIO3.0\n\n• BT interface: UART/PCM Expansion Port Dual-row pin: 2.54mm 40Pin\n\n• Supports DC 5V and 3.3V power output\n\n• Configurable UART, PWM, I2C, SPI, CAN, GPIO and other functional interfaces Button 1 × MaskRom key, 1 × On/Off key Power Source Supports Type-C power supply, 5V @ 5A LED RGB LED side illumination FAN 5V 2PIN 1.25mm socket RTC 3V 2PIN 1.25mm socket Debugging Debug serial UART included in 40PIN expansion port Supported OS Orangepi OS (Droid), Orangepi OS (Arch), Orangepi OS (OH), Ubuntu, Debian, Android 13 PCB Length: 89mm, Width: 57mm, Thickness: 1.6mm Weight 60.5g\n\nThe model I received for this review was a 8 GB one. One of the key reasons to use this SBC over other versions, is that it leverages LPDDR5 memory capable of very good speeds.\n\nWhat I like about the specs is the numerous options for storage (one eMMC and another NVME M2 slot), the 2 Gigabit Ethernet port (a single one this time, so don’t expect to make it into a router), the 4 USB ports (sufficient to connect keyboard, mouse, and something else).\n\nOn paper, the specs are impressive with the fairly recent Rockchip processor. There is a NPU as well, but don’t expect to have it supported easily in Linux, even on AMD the NPU support is shaky at best. For this SBC, it involves cross-compilation, custom binaries before you can exploit a model on this board.\n\nThis is what the layout of the board looks like:\n\nHere’s the back view:\n\nNow you should be aware of the following:\n\nMobile GPUs don’t support OpenGL, only the OpenGLES subtype. You can get some Vulkan support (1.2), but as we will see later, hardware support is unfortunately not there yet.\n\nThe board is priced at around 130 USD for the 16GB version (it seems to be the main one being sold right now). Which is roughly equivalent to the Raspberry Pi 5 price for the same amount of memory. However, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra board is much more powerful in comparison, so depending on your use case, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra would represent a better value for money.\n\nOf course, the usefulness of such a board depends entirely on the quality of the software support.\n\nSoftware Support\n\nA Full Ubuntu Experience\n\nThere are many images available for this board. Ubuntu, Debian, Arch… at first I was wondering which one to go for. Even in each category you have a bunch of different images:\n\nFocal (20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version.\n\n(20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version. Jammy (22.04 LTS), desktop with GNOME or Xfce, or a server version. But it goes deeper than that. You get two different kernel available. An old 5.10 kernel or a 6.1.\n\nI went for the Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS with the 6.1 kernel, the desktop build using Xfce (GNOME was not available for that kernel).\n\nAs you can see, the Ubuntu 24.04 distro is missing from the list, and this is a shame, since this is a board released late 2024. I contacted OrangePi and they mentioned that they would eventually release a 24.04 version, but there was no clear timeline for that.\n\nTo install Ubuntu, you use dd or Balena Etcher to image a micro-SD card first, and then you get some helper scripts (using ncurses) that make it super easy to image either a eMMC chip, or a NVME drive that’s attached to the board (I don’t recommend using a micro-SD card as the main media).\n\nOnce you reach the desktop, you will see that things work pretty much as expected. Wifi, Bluetooth, and even the HDMI port could properly recognize my Ultra Wide Screen and display the full resolution. This was an issue with the RV2 board from Orange Pi (probably hardware/drivers related) but on ARM64 it seems like things are much more robust.\n\nGPU Support?\n\nSadly, but this was almost expected, there does not seem to be any kind of GPU support in the version that I have chosen. A quick check with glxgears confirms that there is just a software pipe for rendering.\n\nThis being said, the software rendering is very very fast - you can see that there’s a lot of power under the hood on the CPU side. The same glxgears was only running at 35 FPS on the RV2, here it’s 10 times faster!\n\nThere is however hope. It looks like there are efforts to mainline the GPU drivers on the Linux kernel, so when this happens you could expect a standard distro like ARMbian to offer full support of the GPU capabilities. Too early to say, but we will come back on that later.\n\nBecause of the lack of GPU support, I will be skipping the gaming aspects of this board for now. I will revisit it in another article once we have proper GPU drivers, to actually see what we can expect from this SBC once we have the Mali ready for some action.\n\nApplications\n\nI installed and tried bunch of things:\n\nChromium is installed by default and works very well, but is limited to the 110 version which is old by now. Using Flathub and Flatpak I could install a much more recent version, that has proper extensions support. Firefox works fine, too - its fork, Zen browser, also works via Flatpak but is very slow for some reason. I also tried a non-Flatpak install for Zen, but it was also slow, so it’s probably not related to Flatpak itself.\n\nThis is now a good time to talk about Flatpak. When I was reviewing the RV2 board which sports a RISC-V chip, I remarked that there are very few Flatpaks that actually support that architecture. So in effect, while flatpak is supposed to work regardless of the architecture, if you don’t have any binary built for your architecture, you won’t be able to make much use of Flathub and the like. For ARM64, the support is not 100% either, but there is a massive footprint of applications that support ARM64. I tried quite a lot of applications and I was constantly surprised wow, they even have ARM64 for that!. I surmise that this is the effect of having a mainstream ARM64 desktop machine out there running Linux with the Macbooks equipped with the M chipsets, running Asahi. (and a lot of folks who have such machines being developers themselves, of course).\n\nWhile most applications worked with the RV2 (which is roughly equivalent to a Raspberry Pi 3), it showed its limits when you wanted to do video editing for example. Kdenlive and Openshot were barely working. Here, with the OrangePi 5 Ultra, Kdenlive works like a breeze and had no issue dealing with a bit of video editing and rendering. The final video render was certainly not as fast as what you’d expect on a regular X86_64 platform, but you know, it’s workable if you are not dealing with very long videos (also, avoid 4k). We are certainly dealing with a much more capable SOC here.\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried some more professional applications like Dbeaver (for databases interactions), and it worked as expected.\n\nThe same with Memgraph (graph database), used via Docker (since they don’t have a client for ARM64, I used the web client instead). Of course, I did not try to load a massive graph database with this, but the system was very responsive and usable. Honestly, very impressive to see Memgraph running so well on a SBC.\n\nI wasted a lot of time trying to make R and Rstudio for ARM64 work togeher from the distro (without success, there was some kind of issue with the tools base package not being recognized), until I switched gears and used a Docker version of R/Rstudio instead. Once again this proved to work very well (Rstudio is a Java application so the browser IDE is basically identical).\n\nThe only appplication that did not work well was Blender. It launched, but afterwards it was a slideshow with 3 seconds between an interaction and the refresh of the screen. I assume this is because Blender requires GPU support even for its innerworkings, and since we don’t have GPU acceleration in this OS, it’s just not going to cut it.\n\nBut honestly… that’s it! Everything else I tried worked as expected on a usual desktop or laptop. At no time did I feel this is too slow, I can’t wait to stop my review - instead, if you told me that I would only have that SBC to do regular work, well, I could totally see myself living with it for 90% of my use cases.\n\nVery impressive to see this kind of performance in this form factor. And this is a board running only at 1.8 Ghz! I can only imagine how things will improve once they go to a better lithography and manage to increase the frequency of the CPU.\n\nTemperature Control\n\nThe temperature does rise a little when using all cores at once, but it remains at a manageable level. When doing some bursts of compilation the temperature rises up to about 78~80C, and when running LLMs on the CPU (full 100% CPU usage), we get up to 84, 85C.\n\nThis looks like the hard limit - I am not sure if the SBC goes into throttling then, but I did not observe higher temperature. In any cases, in all situations (apart from Blender), the system remained very responsive.\n\nPower Draw\n\nI don’t have a way to measure power draw, but according to AndroidPIMP you can expect an idle power draw between 3W and 5W, and an usage under load on average around 10W. Since the power source can produce 25W maximum, I guess you can imagine the board going up to 15W or so in spikes. In any case, its low power profile and the fact that the temperature remains well under control tells me that this is a great little machine for a server.\n\nAI - LLM Performance\n\nFor this part, I compiled both Ollama and llama.cpp and run some benchmarks on llama.cpp. I tried only smaller models, as I had low expectations that it would be running at usable speeds. The results are below, produced with the llama-bench command.\n\nmodel size params backend threads test t/s gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 pp512 23.37 ± 0.94 gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 tg128 2.49 ± 0.62 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 pp512 36.34 ± 1.78 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 tg128 5.06 ± 0.10\n\nFor dense models like Gemma 1B, it’s kind of slow and not really good for chatting. If you plan to use LLMs with this, however, MOE models like granite 3.1 3B work at a decent speed (5 tokens by second, not bad). I would certainly prefer 10 tokens by second minimum, but this is what we have to live with, at least when using the CPU mode. It’s certainly a lot more usable than the RV2 review previously.\n\nOnce we have a capable Vulkan driver working, I wonder if Vulkan can be leveraged to increase the token generation speed on this SBC. It works well on AMD configurations because they can share the overall memory with the iGPU. On ARM, I am not sure if the same flexibility exists.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe go-to suite to evaluate performance is Geekbench, because it can provide some comparison between the speed of similar tests across different architectures. Here, let’s compare it against another flagship ARM64 board, the Raspberry Pi 5 running at 2.4 ghz.\n\nSpec OrangePi 5 Ultra Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.1 Operating System Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) Processor ARM ARMv8 @ 1.80 GHz, 1 Processor, 8 Cores ARM ARMv8 @ 2.40 GHz, 1 Processor, 4 Cores” Memory 8 GB model 8 GB model\n\nSingle Core Performance\n\nBoth boards end up with a very similar performance on average in single core tests.\n\nThere are some differences, but it’s fairly marginal.\n\nMulti-core performance\n\nWhen doing multi-threaded, multi-core workflows, this is where we see the 8 processors that are available on the Orange Pi 5 Ultra shine.\n\nIts performance surpasses the Raspberry Pi 5 in almost all activities, and usually by a good 30% advantage.\n\nPerformance overview\n\nAs you can see, for parallel workloads, this board is much better than the Raspberry Pi 5.\n\nNow let’s look at the potential use of such boards as servers.\n\nServer Use\n\nYou can use this board as a server, of course. You have several distro images just for the server use, too. Docker works very nicely with this SBC, and unlike what we have seen for the RV2 and the general Risc-V ecosystem where there are very few Docker images available for that architecture, the ARM64 scene is completely different.\n\nHere, it’s almost rare to find a Docker image where there is no ARM64 build. Not surprising since ARM64 is a thing on servers nowadays - Amazon has famously pushed their own ARM Gravitron servers as an option to reduce cloud computing costs. So most companies and providers operating on the cloud pretty much need to have ARM64 builds.\n\nOn the server, you also don’t need to care as much about the lack of GPU support since you are running headless, so any distro provided by OrangePi should do: Debian, Ubuntu, or even Arch.\n\nSince this is a board that operates at low wattage and passive cooling, it’s an excellent choice if you want to build a small server for the home. For a NAS use case I would probably go for the RV2 instead since it has more storage ports, but this one could also work considering you can have an eMMC drive together with another M2 drive (NVME) at the same time.\n\nVerdict\n\nLittle boards that were previously only used for fun or small projects have come a long way. Desktop environments were rarely usable before even on the later iterations of the Raspberry Pi. Things changed a couple of years ago, and the Raspberry Pi 5 and this Orange Pi 5 Ultra fall into a category where you could actually use them as real, daily general purpose computers and not be bothered by their responsiveness, or their performance. Not only will it work well for server use, but it can do desktop work without sweating either.\n\nPrice wise, the 16 GB version is competitive. If you want similarly specced Celeron-equipped mini-PCs you would probably need a configuration with a N100 processor (that seems to be faster than the RK3588), but that is more expensive. So the value for money of this SBC seems to be pretty good at the moment, even for the 16G configuration.\n\nThe only negative points are the moment are:\n\nlack of recent distro images (Ubuntu 24.04 would be nice)\n\nlack of GPU support (potentially because I was using the 6.1 kernel?)\n\nincomplete mainline support\n\nwhich may be some killer aspects depending on your use case. The wide availability of software for ARM64 on Flatpak and Docker somewhat mitigates such issues for now.\n\nThe real solution will come when the RK3588 support will be properly mainlined. Currently only parts of it are supported but it’s not complete and bug-free from what I could read. I am following news around the Arch-based BredOS as they are actively working on bringing proper support for this chip. Once this is done, the benefits should be apparent such as:\n\nMuch better Vulkan performance (compared to proprietary driver)\n\nProper video acceleration in browsers like Chrome\n\nNo more patches to chase from one kernel to the next!\n\nOnce there are news in this regard (hopefully in 2025) I plan to revisit my review of this SBC.\n\nPractical Details\n\nIf you are interested to grab one, there are currently a few shops that sell it online:\n\nAliexpress store: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB at 220 USD (without shipping). Expensive if you are in the US.\n\nAmazon OrangePi Official: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB sells for 158 USD on Amazon.com. (without shipping) - the cheaper option.\n\nThere are probably some more third parties depending on where you are based in the world.\n\nOther valuable resources:\n\nThe OrangePi 5 Ultra Product Page\n\nThe user manual for the board\n\nThe distro page on the OrangePi website.\n\nFinal note, we have been provided with a review unit of this SBC by OrangePi themselves for this article."

Llama is particularly well-suited to these sensitive use cases because, as an open source platform, it can be securely downloaded and deployed without the need to transfer sensitive data through third-party AI providers. Governments can also fine-tune Llama models using their own sensitive national security data, host them in secure environments at various levels of classification, and deploy models tailored for specific purposes on-device in the field.\n\nSince late last year, we have also made Llama available for national security use cases to America’s Five Eyes security partners — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK — and their private sector partners. We are now expanding this access to a number of key US democratic allies in Europe and Asia: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, as well as NATO and European Union institutions.\n\nLlama has been used to help develop advanced AI tools for the US military and national security agencies, enhancing decision-making, mission-specific capabilities, and operational efficiency. For example, Meta is working with the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command on a pilot project to demonstrate how AI and technologies like augmented and virtual reality can help to speed routine repairs and help the Army get equipment back into the field more quickly.\n\nTo bring Llama-based solutions to these US allies, our partners include Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anduril, Ask Sage, Booz Allen, C3 AI, Circus, Cyberspatial, Databricks, EdgeRunner AI, Google Cloud, IBM, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, Snowflake, and others.\n\nWe are also supporting US national security through our work developing augmented and virtual reality technologies. Through our partnership with Anduril, we are developing a range of wearable products to help maintain America’s technological edge. This program represents the largest effort of its kind to equip US soldiers with enhanced perception and decision-making capabilities.\n\nIn a world where geopolitical power and national security are deeply intertwined with economic output, innovation, and growth, the widespread adoption of open source models like Llama will be essential to maintaining US and allied AI leadership and ensuring our shared values underpin the systems and standards adopted elsewhere. This is recognized by the US government in its AI Action Plan for America, which Meta endorses.\n\nIt is the responsibility of countries leveraging AI for national security to deploy AI ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with relevant international law and fundamental principles, principles the United States and many of its allies have committed to in the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.\n\nWe are taking a step-by-step approach to extending access to Llama for defense and national security purposes, and will consider adding further countries in the future in consultation with the US government."

Aside from performance, this is a good-looking laptop that boasts a bright and vibrant IPS display.\n\nWhy you can trust Creative Bloq Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nAnother month, another \"AI\" laptop. This time, it's the MSI Prestige A16 AI+.\n\nMSI has been relentless in its pursuit of the best AI laptop to appeal to people looking for good graphic design laptops, releasing three different models in the past 18 months alone. I’ve reviewed a number of them, from the ultra-portable Prestige 13 AI+ Evo that lacked power to the balanced Prestige 14 AI and the surprisingly capable Prestige 16 AI.\n\nThese three reviews show that the world of AI laptops is still very much hit and miss. If you're seriously into AI image generation, are running AI-powered effects in video editing, or need a finely tuned machine for 3D rendering, then you're likely to come up short. More often than not, dedicated creative workflows will still benefit from dedicated machines.\n\nSo, can the new MSI Prestige A16 AI+ finally buck the trend and deliver on its promise? Let's find out.\n\nKey specifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Specs as tested CPU: AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 365 NPU: 50 NPU TOPS (73 total AI TOPS) Graphics: AMD Radeon™ 880M Memory: 32GB LPDDR5 Storage: 1TB Screen size: 16 inches Screen type: IPS-Level Resolution: QHD+(2560x1600) Refresh rate: 165 Hz Colour gamut: 100% DCI-P3 Brightness: 400 nits Ports: 2x USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, microSD card reader, audio combo jack Wireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v5.4 Dimensions: 358 x 258.55 x 16.9 -17.35 mm Weight: 1.9 kg\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nDesign, build and display\n\n• Modern aesthetic with tapered edge\n\n• IPS-panel 100% DCI-P3 and 16:10 ratio display\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ makes a strong first impression with its minimalist silver aluminium chassis, which exudes a sleek and professional aesthetic. The base panel consists of a number of design touches that attempt to reduce any sense of bulk and clunkiness that is often associated with 16-inch laptops. These include a tapered edge, a recessed keyboard panel, and a hinge that drops the display down to desk level.\n\nThe laptop's 16-inch IPS panel might not be as superior as an OLED alternative, but it's still pretty bright and vibrant. Using it to edit photos and videos was a joy, even in a light-filled room. It also delivers an impressive level of colour accuracy as well as high levels of contrast. Additionally, the 16:10 aspect ratio provides valuable vertical screen real estate, which is excellent for video timelines and document editing.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe display also includes the professional DCI-P3 colour space with 100% coverage. This will be sufficient for most users wanting to make the most of HDR content, but if your work requires an even broader range of colours, then you'll need a display that supports either Adobe RGB or Rec. 2020.\n\nThe keyboard is relatively comfortable, although the size of the keys and distance of travel between keys is a little more than I would have liked for an optimum experience. The trackpad is central to the keyboard, which I like. However, for any task requiring precision, such as graphic design or detailed video editing, a dedicated mouse remains a necessity. The base panel also includes a fingerprint reader to the side, which allows for a quick and easy login.\n\nWeighing in at 1.9 kg (4.2 lbs), the laptop is definitely at the lighter end of the spectrum for 16-inch laptops. This makes it easy to pop in your bag and carry it with you wherever you go. Given that it could cope with some extra weight, I think MSI could have bulked out the display panel to make it less flexible. I want my laptops to be as robust as possible, and even though the base is super durable, the display panel needs more work.\n\nIn terms of external ports, MSI has opted for a pretty simple offering with two USB-Cs, a USB-A, an HDMI, a microSD card reader, and an audio combo jack. For creatives, the most valuable feature is the two Thunderbolt 4-enabled USB-C ports. These not only provide fast 40Gbps data transfer speeds for quickly moving large video and photo files but also support Power Delivery 3.0, allowing you to charge the laptop and connect high-resolution external displays simultaneously.\n\nDesign score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nFeatures\n\n• Supercharged performance thanks to AI smarts\n\n• An IPS display designed with creatives in mind\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is designed with several features specifically targeted at creative professionals and content creators. These features focus on performance, display quality, and AI-powered tools.\n\n1. AI-powered performance\n\nTo begin with, the laptop is equipped with a powerful AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor, which includes a Neural Processing Unit (NPU). More on how this performs in the dedicated performance section.\n\nThe MSI AI Engine will automatically detect what you're doing (content creation, work, entertainment, etc.) and adjust the hardware settings for optimal performance. I appreciated this, especially when I was flipping between Photoshop, Premiere Pro, SolidWorks, and other applications.\n\nAdditionally, the laptop provides access to Copilot+, Live Captions, Cocreator, and Recall. These combined provide a set of tools which will boost and enhance your productivity (if you use them wisely). Integration into dedicated creative workflows is still lacking, but if you embrace what's there already, then you'll notice some performance benefits.\n\n2. QHD+ Display\n\nMost of this was covered in the above design section, but it's worth stating that the display is specifically set up for creative professionals. The 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, 16-inch QHD+ resolution (2560 x 1600), and 165Hz refresh rate find their benefits across rendering, animation, video editing, and office applications. I found using the display an absolute joy, no matter whether I was browsing the web, doing some word processing, or getting knee-deep in video editing.\n\n3. Connectivity\n\nUSB Type-C with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility and a MicroSD card reader will help creatives to transfer files quickly and efficiently. I loved how quickly I was able to move files onto the machine, no matter whether I was dealing with MB or GB. This is a machine that can handle large files with ease.\n\nFeature score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nBenchmark scores\n\nWe test every one of our laptops using the same benchmarking software suite to give you a thorough overview of its suitability for creatives of all disciplines and levels. This includes:\n\n• Geekbench: Tests the CPU for single-core and multi-core power, and the GPU for the system's potential for gaming, image processing, or video editing. Geekbench AI tests the CPU and GPU on a variety of AI-powered and AI-boosted tasks.\n\n• Cinebench: Tests the CPU and GPU's ability to run Cinema 4D and Redshift.\n\n• UL Procyon: Uses UL Solutions' Procyon software suite to test the system's ability for AI image generation in Stable Diffusion, its Microsoft Office performance and its battery life in a looping video test.\n\n• Topaz Video AI: We use Topaz Video AI to test the system's ability to upscale video and convert video to slow-motion.\n\n• PugetBench for Creators: We use the PugetBench for Creators benchmarking suite to test the system's ability to run several key tasks in Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro, as well as its performance when encoding/transcoding video.\n\n• ON1 Resize AI: Tests the system's ability to resize 5 photos to 200% in a batch process. We take the total time taken to resize the images and divide by 5.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Header Cell - Column 1 MSI Prestige A16 AI+ GEEKBENCH 6 CPU Single-core: Row 0 - Cell 2 Row 1 - Cell 0 CPU Multi-core: Row 1 - Cell 2 Row 2 - Cell 0 GPU OpenCL: Row 2 - Cell 2 CINEBENCH 2024 CPU single-core: Row 3 - Cell 2 Row 4 - Cell 0 CPU multi-core: Row 4 - Cell 2 Row 5 - Cell 0 GPU: Row 5 - Cell 2 UL PROCYON AI Image Generation (Stable Diffusion 1.5) Row 6 - Cell 2 Row 7 - Cell 0 Office Productivity Benchmark: Row 7 - Cell 2 Row 8 - Cell 0 Battery Life Benchmark: Row 8 - Cell 2 TOPAZ VIDEO AI Enhancement: Row 9 - Cell 2 Row 10 - Cell 0 Slowmo: Row 10 - Cell 2 Row 11 - Cell 0 Combined: Row 11 - Cell 2 ON1 RESIZE 200% resize time: Row 12 - Cell 2 PUGETBENCH for PHOTOSHOP Overall: Row 13 - Cell 2 Row 14 - Cell 0 General: Row 14 - Cell 2 Row 15 - Cell 0 Filter: Row 15 - Cell 2 PUGETBENCH for DAVINCI RESOLVE Overall: Row 16 - Cell 2 Row 17 - Cell 0 GPU Effects: Row 17 - Cell 2 Row 18 - Cell 0 Fusion score: Row 18 - Cell 2 Row 19 - Cell 0 AI score: Row 19 - Cell 2 Row 20 - Cell 0 H.264 encoding: Row 20 - Cell 2\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nPerformance\n\n• Strong performance when using Adobe Photoshop\n\n• The lack of a discrete GPU means creative professionals will struggle\n\nOne of the current issues that I have with AI laptops is that they promise so much and pitch themselves as the solution to all problems. The advertising makes them sound like their AI technology will provide you with instant results, no matter the application and workflow. Maybe I'm overstating it, but it certainly feels like that to me.\n\nThat's why I was left pleasantly surprised by the Prestige A16 AI+. The lack of a discrete GPU was problematic for 3D rendering and colour grading, but the CPU and integrated GPU actually did a great job in Photoshop and Premiere Pro. The fact that it was able to handle complex video compositions and layered effects was not what I expected.\n\nAlongside photo and video editing, I also spent a lot of time browsing the web, watching videos, and carrying out general-purpose office work. The laptop served up a responsive and snappy experience in this area, which further contributed to the laptop's impressive performance.\n\nI was also impressed by the laptop's ability to perform across a broad range of applications. I think this was in part thanks to the MSI AI Engine that was adjusting hardware settings behind the scenes. It really does excel in this role, as demonstrated by its Geekbench scores. With a reasonable multi-core score, this laptop is good at multi-threading, but not to the degree of something like the ASUS ProArt P16 (2025).\n\nThe laptop's battery life, however, proved to be a significant limitation, lasting a relatively short eight hours. That means you'll either need to consign it to a permanent desk setup or be happy carrying the charger around with you. I thought I could overcome this by utilising a lightweight third-party charger, but the apparent lack of wattage meant that the system slowed to a total standstill. By way of comparison, you'll get similar battery performance on the ASUS V16 and Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.\n\nWith all this considered, the Prestige A16 AI+ is a high-performing laptop for most types of creative applications. Keep in mind, though, that if you need a laptop for more demanding graphics applications, you'll want a device with a discrete GPU.\n\nPerformance score: 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nPrice\n\nThe MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is a mid-range to high-end laptop that costs $1,399/£1,499, although there are often limited-time deals around that bring the price down considerably. If you'd prefer an OLED display with a higher resolution (UHD+ 3840x2400) then a model with that spec is also available.\n\nIn terms of comparison, you might also like the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i Gen 9, although it'll set you back at least £1,635. If you'd like something a bit more middle of the road, then the Dell XPS 16 is a great alternative, especially if you're keen on customising your own machine.\n\nValue score: 4/5\n\nWho is it for?\n\n• Content creators who don't need a discrete GPU\n\nHopefully it goes without saying, but if you're into 3D modelling, animation, rendering, high-resolution video editing, and colour grading, then you'll need a laptop with a discrete GPU. If you're creating other types of content, performing low-demand creative tasks, or needing a laptop that can boost your productivity, then the MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is well worth a look.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally MSI Prestige A16 AI+ score card Attributes Notes Rating Design: A modern aesthetic with a bright IPS display. Also perfect for portability. 4/5 Features: AI-powered performance takes centre stage, and at times it delivers, but not always. 4/5 Performance: Great for most creative projects, but the lack of a discrete GPU will be a problem for some. 4/5 Value: A relatively affordable laptop, but keep in mind it doesn't have a discrete GPU. 4/5\n\n(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)\n\nBuy it if...\n\nYou value AI-accelerated performance\n\nYou want a bright and accurate display\n\nYou need excellent portability\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou need a discrete GPU\n\nYou're only going to be web browsing"

            "content": "OBS Studio 32.0 has been released. The update sees this streaming and screen recording stable gain a nifty new plugin manager, change a few of its default settings and expand its support for NVIDIA RTX effects.\n\nThe new plugin manager is described as “basic” because it is: it shows a list of installed plugins with a checkbox to enable/disable, but ‘Browse’ and ‘Update’ options are greyed out (those options being there suggests it will be possible to find and install plugins in OBS directly).\n\nOBS Studio 3.20 increases the default bitrate from 2500 to 6000 Kbps.\n\nThe old value was decided upon a decade ago, and expectations in quality have shifted. OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.\n\nUsers with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.\n\nHybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.\n\nOn Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.\n\nOther notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:\n\nOpt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)\n\nExperimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs\n\nAudio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc\n\n--disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed\n\nPlugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded\n\nBeyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.\n\nThough a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.\n\nHow to Install OBS Studio 32.0\n\nOBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).\n\nOn Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.\n\nThere’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).\n\nTo install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio\n\nThen, install OBS Studio using apt :\n\nsudo apt install obs-studio\n\nFinally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team."

            "content": "Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.\n\nThis announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.\n\nWhile an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.\n\nStill, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.\n\nNevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.\n\nEven though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

            "content": "Comment Ending America's reliance on foreign chip fabs remains a high priority for Uncle Sam, but the Trump administration's \"my way or the highway\" approach to the issue threatens to do more harm than good.\n\nWhere the Biden administration sought to use federal subsidies and tax breaks as a carrot to encourage investment in domestic chip production, the current administration's philosophy can best be described as a stick wielded by a capricious bully, unconcerned whether or not his demands can be met, only that concessions are made.\n\nIn some respects, it reflects a modern economic take on Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology, only Trump seems to have ignored the speaking softly bit and jumped straight to swinging his stick like every problem is a piñata with candy inside. Trump need not even swing his stick – all he has to do is make a threat, and those in its path scramble to appease him. And whether you agree with this approach, as life-alteringly disruptive as they might be, he has been effective at getting US companies to bend to his will.\n\nLast month, the US claimed a 10 percent stake in Intel. The $8.9 billion equity deal drew on previously awarded but unpaid CHIPS Act funds, along with the Secure Enclave program. The congressionally-approved funds had already been awarded to the x86 giant, but only a fraction of them had been distributed when Trump took office.\n\nIn March, the threat of massive chip tariffs drove Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to bolster its investment in US manufacturing to the tune of $165 billion. Many months later, the White House still hasn't pulled the trigger on said tariffs.\n\nHowever, as the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, that could soon change. The Commerce Department is reportedly weighing whether to require US tech companies to manufacture one chip in the US for every chip imported, or pay a tariff. That tariff, Trump warned last month, could be as much as 100%.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is said to have discussed the idea with industry executives, arguing the measures may be necessary to maintain the US' economic security.\n\nBy some estimates, 90 percent of leading-edge silicon is manufactured by TSMC. The vast majority of that comes from fabs in Taiwan, an island whose sovereignty is a controversial subject for its neighbor 80 miles to the west. US government officials have warned for years that China could exploit the world's continued reliance on Taiwan.\n\nHowever, achieving a 1:1 ratio of chip production to imports may be harder than the White House might think.\n\nTSMC's US build out won't change the calculus much — at least not before Trump's second term expires. Building a leading-edge wafer fab takes years. TSMC's first Arizona foundry site was announced amid the 2020 election, and only this year began ramping up production.\n\nIt's estimated that, when all is said and done, about 30 percent of TSMC's 2nm and smaller fab capacity will eventually be centered in the US, but it'll be years before that happens.\n\nIntel could pick up some of the slack in the meantime. Its new Arizona fabs are already in production, with its first generation of chips based on Intel 18A, a 2nm-class process node. It certainly wouldn't be surprising to see the White House drive potential foundry customers into Intel's arms now that it's a stakeholder in the company's success.\n\nThe problem is it takes years and hundreds of millions of dollars to tape out a chip on a new process node. Companies already evaluating 18A or Intel's forthcoming 14A process tech may be able to move a bit faster, but there are still a lot of ifs. Intel needs to have the capacity to take on new customers, and its fabs will need to achieve high enough yields, or a move could end up costing fab customers more than simply paying the tariffs.\n\nIntel is currently in the process of clawing back products previously outsourced to TSMC, and as such it stands to benefit the most, or perhaps suffer the least, from the reported policy change.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and AMD have insulated themselves to some degree, announcing plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Fab 21 wafer plant in Arizona. To what extent, however, they haven't said.\n\nFor everyone else who hasn't already signed large-scale commitments with TSMC for domestic fab capacity, avoiding the semi-tariffs will be nearly impossible for the remainder of Trump's second term. ®",

            "headline": "Linux Kernel 6.17 Released, This is What’s New",
            "content": "EXT4 filesystem boosts – and changes to help SSDs last longer\n\nLinus Torvalds has announced the release of Linux kernel 6.17, an update that brings improved hardware support and a number of core system improvements.\n\nThe new kernel provides graphic drivers for the latest Intel ‘Panther Lake’ laptops, better power management features for devices with AMD hybrid GPUs, resolves a software bug that’s been knocking around since 1993, and helps SSDs last longer.\n\nAnnouncing the release on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), Linus Torvalds says: “No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go.”\n\nUbuntu 25.10 ships wit the new kernel, including in the beta build that was released last week. Users on the current long-term support release, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, will receive kernel 6.17 as part of the next hardware enablement (HWE) update in early 2026.\n\nIs this kernel a solid upgrade? You know it is! For a whip through the new features in Linux 6.17 which caught my eye, read on.\n\nLinux 6.17: What’s New?\n\nGraphics & Gaming\n\nAlienware’s ‘boost’ key (top row) gets a standardised keycode\n\nThe first Core Ultra Series 3 laptops powered by Intel ‘Panther Lake’ chips are due to go on sale soon, so it’s timely that Intel Xe3 integrated graphics are enabled by default in Linux 6.17. This ensures anyone bagging a new model and installing Ubuntu 25.10 gets solid graphics performance off the bat.\n\nSmartMux in 6.17 will switch between integrated and discrete graphics on AMD laptops\n\nFor those using laptops equipped with Core Ultra Series 2 (‘Lunar Lake’) chips, the Intel IPU7 driver has proper web camera support. Ideal for online meetings, social chats and accidental jump-scares when launching the camera app by accident.\n\nAMD hybrid GPU laptops gain SmartMux support with Linux 6.17. This auto-switches between integrated and discrete graphics based on workload to (obviously) save power or deliver maximum performance if needed.\n\nLenovo WMI Gaming Series Drivers add support for both Legion Go and the SteamOS-powered Legion Go S handheld, which will be especially handy for those looking to run other kinds of Linux-based operating systems on the AMD-powered handheld.\n\nThe kernel also standardises the keycode used by the (mysterious) “performance boost” key on newer Dell and Alienware laptops, and the (rather frutiger aero-looking) Flydigi Apex 5 game controller now has proper support on Linux — nice!\n\nOn a tangentially gaming-related note, the networking stack adds DualPI2 congestion control support. This helps to reduce network queue latency, which should prove beneficial for online gaming, streaming, video calls, and other real-time applications.\n\nFilesystem changes\n\nKernel write changes may help SSDs last longer\n\nThere are many filesystems improvements in 6.17 that will be directly appreciable by those of us running a desktop Linux distribution (not just the one this site is named after, either).\n\nUbuntu’s default file system is EXT4, and Linux 6.17 sees major performance boosts\n\nPerhaps most significant: the kernel can now write zeroes efficiently without actual I/O operations on NVMe SSDs that support the DEAC bit, and SCSI SSDs which support the UMMAP bit (a ‘bit’ is a kind of indicator of a feature state).\n\nThe FALLOC_FL_WRITE_ZEROES option for fallocate() will mark storage regions as zero-filled internally on modern SSDs. This will improve performance and reduce wear (SSDs theoretically have finite read/write lifespans, so fewer writes = lasts longer).\n\nUbuntu’s default filesystem EXT4 improves block allocation scalability. Per benchmarks, this provides noticeable performance benefits under I/O heavy tasks like querying databases or copying large numbers of files.\n\nBtrfs adds experimental large-folio support, which reduces memory management overhead when handling large files. This, combined with compression control during defragmentation, makes Btrfs better suited to performance-sensitive workloads.\n\nEROFS supports metadata compression and faster directory reading, which should prove especially handy on systems with read-only root filesystems or in container-heavy workloads. There’s no Bcachefs in the 6.17 merge reports…\n\nLaptop Support\n\nMacBook Pro touchbar becoming ever-more-functional in Linux\n\nLinux support on M1 and M2 Macs continues to improve in Linux 6.17, with the Apple Silicon SMC driver enabling ‘proper’ rebooting of M1 and M2 Macs. With work to run Linux on M3 and M4 Macs in limbo, it’s nice earlier gens are improving their mainline support.\n\nThe Touch Bar on Intel-based MacBook Pros see further improvements in Linux 6.17 with patches to enable touch screen input, albeit with a few lingering quirks. Apple ends support for Intel-based Macs after macOS 26, so Linux will give those devices a new lease of life.\n\nElsewhere, Linux 6.17 brings mainline support for ASUS Zenbook A14 Snapdragon X1 Plus/Elite laptops, allowing more Linux distributions to run on these ARM-based Windows devices. There’s also mainline support for Raspberry Pi 5’s RP1 I/O chip.\n\nGot a keyboard with F13-F24 keys? Those are now properly mapped in Linux 6.17\n\nSupport for Corsair HX1200i PSU monitoring (2025 model) is present; wake-on-touch support added to the Intel Touch Host Controller (along with overlay objects support, great for tablet and 2-in-1 users); and kernel mapping for F13 – F24 keys on PS/2 keyboards.\n\nYes, keyboards with an addition 12 function keys actually exist!\n\nHD Audio support is extended to cover the Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Ryzen AI 300, commercial ASUS laptops using CS35L41 HDA, and HP EliteBook models. USB audio offloading (a feature in Linux 6.xx) covers more mobile devices, including Fairphone 4.\n\nCore kernel changes\n\nNew Attack Vector Controls have been integrated to simplify security handling for known CPU vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown. Previously, each mitigation had its own kernel command-line option. In 6.17, there’s a unified option.\n\nMaking it easier for Linux server admins (and others) to disable unneeded protections may help them claw back performance dips certain mitigations require as well make it easier to manage the growing number of hardware vulnerability bandaids.\n\nSupport for uniprocessor configuration has been removed from the kernel scheduler. Every machine, even those which run on a single-core processor will now ‘unconditionally’ run a kernel designed for multicore systems.\n\nThis shouldn’t lead to any detrimental impact on single-core systems (not that many folks likely run one full-time in 2025), but adopting a unified scheduling approach across all CPUs should reduce code and make kernel behaviour more reliable.\n\nSpeed Boosts?\n\nLinux 6.17 picks up initial proxy execution support. This new kernel feature may speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when a high-priority application is waiting for a resource, the system temporarily gives the resource holder a boost, causing it to finish and release the resource faster.\n\nA new kernel feature could speed up apps by preventing slowdowns when high-priority tasks are waiting for a resource\n\nOr to word it the way kernel devs would, this resolves “priority-inversion problems” by enabling “high-priority tasks waiting for locks to donate execution context to lock holders”, which reduces latency spikes — slowdowns — in desktop apps.\n\nMemory management sees various optimisations across the kernel subsystems, notable with improved futex performance for heavily threaded applications (and more reliable crash kernel handling for debugging when things go wrong).\n\nAMD’s Hardware Feedback Interface (HFI) was added. Modern processors mix two types of cores: performance and efficiency. On AMD, HFI gives the kernel info to help it decide which core is better suited to which tasks, improving performance and power management.\n\nWeird Stuff\n\nLinux 6.17 removes the Pktcdvd packet-writing optical driver. It was deprecated in 2016, survived a removal attempt in 2023, but now, in 2025 optical packet-writing is definitively done and dusted!

It’s related to ELF program header handling that causes some applications in certain conditions to bug out.

            "headline": "Nvidia’s $100 billion OpenAI investment raises eyebrows and a key question: How much of the AI boom is just Nvidia’s cash being recycled?",
            "content": "Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently. The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back.\n\nIn addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.\n\nThe extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.\n\nIn past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.\n\nNvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.\n\n繼續閱讀\n\nStartups financing data centers have often had to borrow money at rates as high as 15%, compared to 6% to 9% that a large, established corporation such as Microsoft might have to pay. With Nvidia’s backing, OpenAI and Coreweave have been able to borrow at rates closer to what Microsoft or Google might pay.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also signed a $6.3 billion deal to purchase any cloud capacity that CoreWeave can’t sell to others. The chipmaker had previously agreed to spend $1.3 billion over four years on cloud computing with CoreWeave. Coreweave, meanwhile, has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs so far—the majority of which it says are H100 Hopper models, which cost about $30,000 each—which means Coreweave has spent about $7.5 billion buying these chips from Nvidia. So in essence, all of the money Nvidia has invested in Coreweave has come back to it in the form of revenue.\n\n\n\nNvidia has struck similar cloud computing deals with other so-called “neo-cloud” companies. According to a story in The Information, Nvidia agreed this summer to spend $1.3 billion over four years renting some 10,000 of its own AI chips from Lambda, which like Coreweave runs data centers, as well as a separate $200 million deal to rent some 8,000 more over an unspecified time period.\n\nFor those who believe there’s an AI bubble, the Lambda deal is clear evidence of froth. Those Nvidia chips Lambda is renting time on back to Nvidia? It bought them with borrowed money collateralized by the value of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\n\nBesides its large investments in OpenAI and Coreweave, AI chipmaker also holds multi-million dollar stakes in several other publicly-traded companies that either purchase its GPUs or work on related chip technology. These include chip design firm Arm, high-performance computing company Applied Digital, cloud services company Nebius Group, and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals. (Nvidia also recently purchased a 4% stake in Intel for $5 billion. Like Arm, Intel makes chips that in some cases are alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, but which for the most part are complementary to them.)\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia also pledged to invest £2 billion ($2.7 billion) in U.K. AI startups, including at least £500 million in Nscale, a U.K.-based data center operator that will, presumably, be using some of that money to purchase Nvidia GPUs to provision the data centers it is building. Nvidia also said it would invest in a number of British startups, both directly and through local venture capital firms, and some of that money too, will likely come back to OpenAI in the form of computing purchases, either directly, or through cloud service providers, who in turn will need to buy Nvidia GPUs.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia invested about $1 billion in AI startups globally either directly or through its corporate venture capital arm NVentures, according to data from Dealroom and The Financial Times. This amount was up significantly from what Nvidia invested in 2022, the year the generative AI boom kicked off with OpenAI’s debut of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\nHow much of this money winds up coming right back to Nvidia in the form of sales is again, difficult to determine. Wall Street research firm NewStreet Research has estimated that for every $10 billion Nvidia invests in OpenAI, it will see $35 billion worth of GPU purchases or GPU lease payments, an amount equal to about 27% of its annual revenues last fiscal year.\n\nEchoes of the dotcom era\n\nThat kind of return would certainly make this sort of customer financing worthwhile. But it does raise concerns among analysts about a bubble in AI valuations. These kinds of circular deals have been a hallmark of previous technology bubbles and have often come back to haunt investors.\n\nIn this case, the lease arrangements that Nvidia is entering into with OpenAI as part of its latest investment could prove problematic. By leasing GPUs to OpenAI, rather than requiring them to buy the chips outright, Nvidia is sparing OpenAI from having to take an accounting charge for the high depreciation rates on the chips, which will ultimately help OpenAI’s bottom line. But it means that instead Nvidia will have to bear this depreciation costs. What’s more, Nvidia will also take on the risk of being stuck with an inventory of GPUs no one wants if demand for AI workloads don’t match Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s rosy predictions.\n\n\n\nTo some market watchers, Nvidia’s latest deals feel all-too-similar to the excesses of past technology booms. During the dot com bubble at the turn of the 21st Century, telecom equipment makers such as Nortel, Lucent, and Cisco lent money to startups and telecom companies to purchase their equipment. Just before the bubble burst in 2001, the amount of financing Cisco and Nortel had extended to their customers exceeded 10% of annual revenues, and the amount of financing the top five telecom equipment makers had provided to customers exceeded 123% of their combined earnings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the amount of fiber-optic cabling and switching equipment installed far exceeded demand, and when the bubble burst and many of those customers went bust, the telecom equipment makers were left holding the bad debt on their balance sheets. This contributed to a greater loss of value when the bubble burst than would have otherwise been the case, with networking equipment businesses losing more than 90% of their value over the ensuing decade.\n\n\n\nWorse yet were companies such as fiber-optic giant Global Crossing that engaged in direct “revenue roundtripping.” These companies cut deals—often at the end of a quarter in order to hit topline forecasts—in which they paid money to another company for services, and then that company agreed to purchase equipment of exactly equal value. When the bubble burst, Global Crossing went bankrupt, and its executives ultimately paid large legal settlements related to revenue roundtripping.\n\n\n\nIt is memories of these kinds of transactions that have caused analysts to at least raise an eyebrow at some of Nvidia’s circular investments. Goldberg, the Seaport Global analyst, said the deals had a whiff of circular financing and were emblematic of “bubble-like behavior.”\n\n“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note following Nvidia’s announcement of its blockbuster investment in OpenAI. It’s a long way from a concern to a crisis, of course, but as AI company valuations get higher, that distance is starting to close.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "The Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i is the premium, feature-packed 16-inch powerhouse for those who need to work, create, and even game on the go. It's an excellent, incredibly practical laptop that feels like the more reasonable alternative to the divisive Dell 16 Premium (previously the Dell XPS 16). I only wish battery life was better, but I can't say I'm shocked it's not.\n\nWhy you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nCreators, engineers, and other professionals the world over rely on powerful 16-inch laptops to keep them working smoothly, even while staying mobile. The Dell XPS 16 (now the Dell 16 Premium), the Apple MacBook Pro 16, the Razer Blade 16 — these are all great choices, but there's another excellent alternative on the block.\n\nThis is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition... which is a ridiculously long name for an incredibly capable laptop with a practical design, potent performance, and an impressive set of features that make it well-suited to almost any task.\n\nIt's also well priced compared to the aforementioned competition, making it one of the easiest to recommend. While other laptops often focus on sleek and minimalist designs (often at the expense of features or practicality), the Yoga Pro 9i doesn't cut any corners — or ports.\n\nDisclaimer This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. Lenovo had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.\n\nMy Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) review\n\nImage 1 of 4 The clean Lenovo logo and \"communications bar\" are in full display with this laptop. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Most people would be content with just the ports on one side. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) I'd prefer swapping one of those Type-A ports for a Thunderbolt 4 port on the other side, but this is a great I/O selection either way. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) These aren't the slimmest bezels on the block, but the Yoga Pro 9i still feels plenty premium. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDesign ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWhere the Dell 16 Premium (2025) we recently reviewed boasts a controversial, futuristic, and minimalist design, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i absolutely prioritizes function over form.\n\nIt's a familiar two-tier Lenovo design with a rounded base and squared-off lid, creating a unique profile entirely constructed of high-quality aluminum. The Yoga Pro 9i isn't the most refined high-end laptop I've held in my hand and doesn't feature the slimmest display bezel, but it absolutely looks and feels like a premium product.\n\nYou can immediately tell the Yoga Pro 9i is a truly premium laptop, even if it's not the most futuristic design.\n\nAt around 17.9mm thick and 1.93kg heavy, there are certainly beefier 16-inch workstations, but the Yoga Pro 9i's design does make it seem chunkier than it actually is.\n\nAt least you get a ton of ports. There's the 170W DC power port, an HDMI 2.1 port, two full-featured Thunderbolt 4 ports with Power Delivery and DisplayPort functions, a 3.5mm audio jack, two USB Type-A (5GBps) ports, a side-mounted power button, a webcam privacy shutter, and even a full-sized SD card slot. The only things missing are an Ethernet port (Lenovo would've had to make this laptop a fair bit thicker for that) and a Kensington Nano Security Slot, which may actually disappoint some professional users.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nDisplay ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nLenovo actually offers two OLED, touchscreen PureSight Pro display options for the Yoga Pro 9i. Both panels boast a 120Hz refresh rate, excellent color accuracy across standard and cinematic gamuts, Dolby Vision HDR and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 1000 support, and the trifecta of TÜV Rheindland Low Blue Light, TÜV Rheinland Flicker-Free, and Eyesafe certifications.\n\nFor an extra $150, though, you can upgrade to a Tandem OLED display with a higher 3.2K resolution (up from 2.8K), even greater color accuracy (especially in the AdobeRGB gamut), twice the display brightness at up to 1,000 nits (compared to 500 nits, and that's not even with HDR enabled), and greater efficiency to boot. Sadly, Lenovo didn't send me that configuration to test, so I can't tell you just how much better that panel is.\n\nThe entry-level screen is still fantastic, though. It's bright, vibrant, and responsive whether I was working, editing photos, gaming, or watching videos. If the Tandem OLED display is even better, it'll be one of the best panels you'll find on a laptop right now.\n\nPerformance ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, a 16-core CPU with fantastic overall performance and solid efficiency. That's backed by up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 (8GB) GPU, but Lenovo sent me the entry-level configuration with an RTX 5050 inside — and it seriously impressed me.\n\nThis laptop is a strong performer in general, backed by Intel Evo guarantees for responsiveness and bolstered by excellent thermal management. The Yoga Pro 9i never got too warm, never suffered from abnormal throttling, and kept quiet enough even under load.\n\nThe Yoga Pro 9i was practically guaranteed to deliver great performance, but it still managed to surprise me.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, it's the RTX 5050 that surprised me. Lenovo actually offers a GPU overclocking option, and when enabled the Yoga Pro 9i's RTX 5050 performed well beyond the level I expected, coming within a stone's throw of the far more expensive Dell 16 Premium's RTX 5070 without becoming thermally restrained.\n\nI was able to play Forza Horizon 5 with Extreme settings without any issues, either, never dipping below a stable 60 FPS.\n\nImage 1 of 3 I really like this keyboard, but I'm still not a fan of Lenovo's next key coating. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) There's a lot of power packed into this chassis, but you don't feel it most of the time. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy) Intel Evo, NVIDIA Studio — this laptop has all the ingredients it needs to tackle any workflow or task. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nBattery life ⭐⭐⭐½\n\nWith an 84Whr battery stashed away inside, the Yoga Pro 9i certainly has plenty of juice... but it's not enough to translate to true all-day battery life. In my testing, the Yoga Pro 9i can deliver around 5 hours of real-time usage — slightly better than the Dell 16 Premium and its larger 99Whr battery, but nothing too impressive.\n\nYou can use up to 100W USB Type-C chargers whenever you're in a pinch, at least. Performance when off the charger is throttled, but is still absolutely what I'd consider \"flagship\" level — especially the graphical oomph.\n\nThis laptop can't claim to boast the greatest endurance, but it's no worse than much of the competition.\n\nKeyboard & touchpad ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI've historically been a huge fan of Lenovo's keyboards, and that still mostly holds true with the Yoga Pro 9i. The layout, key travel, and consistency are all top-notch, and the keyboard doesn't feel too cramped despite having a compact tenkey number pad off to one side (a feature some will love, and others will hate).\n\nAs I noted in my Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i (Gen 9) Aura Edition review, though, the new coating Lenovo puts on its keys isn't my favorite. This is a good keyboard, it's just slippery.\n\nThe touchpad is spacious and responsive with Microsoft Precision drivers, so I have little to complain about there... but I do wish Lenovo would finally embrace haptic touchpads on its premium consumer laptops.\n\nLenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding doesn't mean anything to 99% of people... this laptop still delivers a great software experience, though. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\nSoftware & AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i runs Windows 11, and it does so without issue. Drivers are stable and Lenovo hasn't injected an absurd amount of bloatware onto the device.\n\nLenovo didn't pour every feature imaginable into the Yoga Pro 9i, it just focused on delivering a capable, high-quality laptop.\n\nYou also get some extra features courtesy of Lenovo's \"Aura Edition\" branding, such as multi-device syncing for photos and files, \"smart\" performance and settings profiles, and Lenovo's \"AI Now\" companion, but the Yoga Pro 9i is not a Copilot+ PC thanks to the weaker NPU of its processor, so it doesn't boast all the latest and greatest artificial intelligence features in Windows.\n\nThat won't make a difference to most people, but it's worth noting this laptop technically isn't on the cutting edge for software.\n\nEverything else ⭐⭐⭐⭐½\n\nThe display isn't the only reason the Yoga Pro 9i is a monster for entertainment, as it also packs a capable six-speaker system (dual 2W tweeters and quad 2W woofers) with Dolby Atmos support.\n\nI won't go as far as claiming these are the best-sounding speakers in a laptop I've heard, but the Yoga Pro 9i does sound full, loud, and clear. You also get a quad microphone array flanking the great 5MP front-facing camera, which is supported by an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition.\n\nI never had any issues with the Wi-Fi 7 or Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, either. The Yoga Pro 9i doesn't rock any additional features like Human Presence Detection (HPD) or ambient light sensors, or a fingerprint reader, but the basics are covered and they're covered well.\n\nYoga Pro 9i (Gen 10) review: My final thoughts\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i isn't one of the most exciting laptops of 2025, but it is one of my favorites. (Image credit: Windows Central | Zachary Boddy)\n\n✅You should buy this if ...\n\nYou need a powerful, feature-packed 16-inch laptop for work and creation.\n\nYou also want that laptop to be good for PC gaming, too.\n\nYou want a laptop with a top-notch OLED display and speaker system.\n\n❌You should not buy this if ...\n\nYou actually care about Windows 11's Copilot+ PC-exclusive features.\n\nYou need a laptop with consistent, easy all-day battery life.\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition may have a slightly ridiculous name, but it's hands-down one of the greatest laptops in the category of \"powerful and premium 16-inch workstations.\"\n\nWhile Apple commits to minimalism and Dell pushes even more aggressively in that direction, Lenovo is delivering an equally capable laptop packed with features and ports — all while undercutting the competition on price. It's a shockingly practical laptop for productivity, creation, entertainment, and gaming.\n\nWhile I do wish the battery could withstand a full day's worth of work without compromise, that doesn't stop this from being one of the best Windows laptops I've tested this year. You can customize your own Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (Gen 10) Aura Edition from $1,869.99 at Lenovo.com, or pull the trigger on the configuration I most recommend for $2,149.99 at Lenovo.com, which upgrades you to that sweet Tandem OLED display and a more powerful RTX 5060 GPU.",

            "content": "Adding to the list of pull requests submitted early in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window opening are several cryptography-related improvements. In particular, some nice performance optimizations once again for the Linux kernel.Google engineer Eric Biggers continues leading some very nice performance improvements in the cryptography space for the Linux kernel.First up is a pull request adding interleaved SHA-256 hashing support . This 2-way interleaved SHA-256 hashing is immediately used by the FS-VERITY module for faster file data verification. In turn it's been observed that FS-VERITY performance improves nicely across many Intel/AMD x86_64 and AArch64 processors. Eric Biggers reported in the patch that it's roughly 35% faster performance.\n\nAlso sent in was the FSCRYPT pull request for Linux 6.18. The focus there is on using HMAC-SHA512 library functions rather than going through crypto_shash. In turn FSCRYPT should enjoy this simpler and faster and more reliable code path.Lastly there was a pull request sent out on Saturday for crypto library updates . This pull brings RISC-V optimized code for Poly1305, simplifies other code, and always enabling architecture-optimized BLAKE2s code.",

            "content": "Spider-Man: Brand New Day is going to see Peter Parker face perhaps his greatest challenge yet. No longer an Avenger, the street-level superhero will have to contend with fellow \"hero\" The Punisher's war on crime, and new threats in The Scorpion and Tombstone.\n\nThe Hulk is also expected to enter the fray, while recent rumours have pointed to the supernatural Shathra being the movie's big bad.\n\nMinor plot details have come our way in dribs and drabs in recent weeks, with the latest shared by scooper Daniel Richtman. He claims that, in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, \"[The] Punisher and Tombstone will be in direct conflict.\"\n\nIf The Punisher has set his sights on him, then this points to Tombstone being a major threat in the movie. Assuming Mayor Wilson Fisk is defeated and imprisoned in Daredevil: Born Again season 2, then it's likely that the power vacuum in New York will lead to a Gang War that Spider-Man and Frank Castle attempt to put an end to.\n\nThis may also go some way in explaining what leads Frank to seemingly go to war with Ma Gnucci in the upcoming Punisher Special Presentation.\n\nRecent set photos have confirmed that the Department of Damage Control will appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, following appearances in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Ms. Marvel.\n\nHowever, before this movie is released, insider @MyTimeToShineH says we'll see the government organisation play a \"huge role\" in December's Wonder Man TV series.\n\nWe're not shocked to learn there's a connection between that and Spider-Man: Brand New Day because filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton has obviously worked on both projects.\n\nRecently, Marvel's Head of Streaming, Television, and Animation, Brad Winderbaum, said, \"Wonder Man is eight episodes. It's a very new flavor for Marvel. It's straight from the minds of Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Guest. Honestly, it is one of my favorite things ever.\"\n\n\"I think it's the best show no one's ever seen, and I’m very excited to see the audience reaction to it,\" the executive teased. \"I think it's a love letter to what we do as filmmakers. It's a love letter to acting as a profession, and it's a very sincere, beautiful show.\"\n\nAs always, let us know your thoughts on these MCU rumours down in the comments section.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day shares a title with a divisive era of storytelling, which, thanks to a deal with Mephisto, saw the wall-crawler get a fresh start when his marriage to Mary Jane Watson ended and his identity became secret again. He faced many new sinister foes during that time and was surrounded by an overhauled supporting cast, including Mister Negative, Jackpot, Menace, and Carlie Cooper.\n\nInstead, all signs point to Spidey teaming up with (and at some point fighting) The Punisher to take on a Savage Hulk, with The Scorpion thrown in for good measure.\n\nSeveral other villains are reportedly set to appear in the movie, including Tombstone, Tarantula, Boomerang, and Ramrod. There's been some chatter online about the Venom Symbiote factoring into the story, potentially setting the stage for Mac Gargan to eventually don the alien costume.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings helmer Destin Daniel Cretton directs Spider-Man: Brand New Day from a script by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland leads a cast that also includes Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, Zendaya, Sadie Sink, Michael Mando, Tramell Tillman, Marvin Jones III, and Liza Colón-Zayas. Thunderbolts* star Florence Pugh has also joined the cast.\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day will be released in theaters on July 31, 2026.",

            "content": "In the early 1980s, there was the IBM PC, with its 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 processor. It was an unexpected hit for the company, and within a few years there were a host of competitors. Every self-respecting technology corporation wanted a piece of the action including processor manufacturers, and among those was NEC with their V20 chip and its V30 sibling. From the outside they were faster pin-compatible 8088 and 8086 clones, but internally they could also run both 8080 and 80186 code. [The Silicon Underground] has a look back at the V20, with some technical details, history, and its place as a PC upgrade.\n\nFor such a capable part it’s always been a surprise here that it didn’t take the world by storm, and the article sheds some light on this in the form of an Intel lawsuit that denied it a critical early market access. By the time it was available in quantity the PC world had moved on from the 8088, so we saw it in relatively few machines. It was a popular upgrade for those in the know back in the day though as it remains in 2025, and aside from its immediate speed boost there are a few tricks it lends to a classic PC clone. The version of DOS that underpinned Windows 95 won’t run on an 8086 or 8088 because it contains 8016 instructions, but a V20 can run it resulting in a much faster DOS experience. One to remember, if an early PC or clone cones your way.\n\nHungry for the good old days of DOS? You don’t need to find 80s hardware for that.",

(Image credit: Xbox Game Studios / Windows Central) The list of Windows Central quizzes continues to grow. You might know your stuff when it comes to Call of Duty: Black Ops, but how will you fare against our other tests?\n\nBlack Ops is a series that has introduced drastic changes to the Call of Duty franchise over the years. In an era when many shooters embraced the brown and gray aesthetic, Black Ops dared to be a little brighter, featuring maps with bolder color palettes that are still among some of the best playgrounds even today.\n\nFrom the Siege of Stalingrad to Project Blackout, Black Ops’ history has taken us on mind-bending adventures across the annals of history that forge a twisted path to a future beyond imagination. And yet, Treyarch leadership says that Black Ops 7 will not bring the series to a close.\n\n“It can’t be [the end] for us because we have so much love for our other games,” answered Yale Miller, Treyarch’s director of production, “Like Black Ops 3 is canon, right? There are still things that are there [to explore].”\n\nWhile Black Ops’ deep lore and extensive campaigns provide plenty of fodder for future titles, so does its much-loved Zombies mode. Effectively a game-within-a-game, Zombies has grown into a beast of its own with its own canon story lines, unique cast, and nightmarish undead foes.\n\nTake our quiz below and test your Call of Duty: Black Ops knowledge:\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set to launch on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation on November 14. The next mainline title in the 20+ year old franchise is expected to be stacked with an all-new cooperative campaign and endgame. You can also look forward to classic multiplayer with a slightly more futuristic twist, and the next chapter in the Dark Aether storyline for its famed Zombies mode.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

Impact Link\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nAn executive order signed by President Donald Trump late Friday, hiking H-1B visa application fees to $100,000, sent Silicon Valley into a tailspin.\n\nH-1B visas have become a mainstay of the tech industry, allowing companies to hire highly-skilled workers from abroad, including engineers.\n\nAffected tech workers and corporate lawyers initially scrambled to decipher the new policies, with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta telling employees on H-1B visas to either stay in the US or return from abroad within 24 hours.\n\nThe Trump administration subsequently clarified that the fees would only apply to new applicants, not renewals or current H-1B holders.\n\nThe Trump administration said it implemented the changes to prevent system \"abuses\" and to encourage companies to train American workers.\n\nSome applauded the new policy, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings, who said it could mean the end of the lottery system, given H-1Bs are capped at 85,000 workers annually. Others worried cash-strapped startups would be most severely affected, or that the executive order could counterintuitively push more jobs out of the country.\n\nBusiness Insider examined publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to track which tech companies had the most H-1B visa approvals in 2025.\n\nBloomberg, Intel, and Nvidia declined to comment. The rest of the companies on this list did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDo you have experience with the H-1B visa program? Business Insider wants to hear from you.

This is what [Adrian Black] did with one hapless victim, with the card in question being mostly in good condition minus an IC that had been rather rudely removed. The core Creative CT1336A and Yamaha YM3812 ICs were still in place, so the task was to figure out what IC was missing, find a replacement and install it.\n\nThe CT1350 is the final revision of the original 8-bit ISA Sound Blaster card, with a number of upgrades that makes this actually quite a desirable soundcard. The CT1350B revision featured here on a card from 1994 was the last to retain compatibility with the C/MS chips featured on the original SB card. After consulting with [Alex] from the Bits und Bolts YT channel, it was found that not only is the missing IC merely an Intel 8051-based Atmel MCU, but replacements are readily available. After [Alex] sent him a few replacements with two versions of the firmware preflashed, all [Adrian] had to do was install one.\n\nBefore installation, [Adrian] tested the card to see whether the expected remaining functionality like the basic OPL2 soundchip worked, which was the case. Installing the new MCU got somewhat hairy as multiple damaged pads and traces were discovered, probably because the old chip was violently removed. Along the way of figuring out how important these damaged pads are, a reverse-engineered schematic of the card was discovered, which was super helpful.\n\nSome awkward soldering later, the card’s Sound Blaster functionality sprung back to life, after nudging the volume dial on the card up from zero. Clearly the missing MCU was the only major issue with the card, along with the missing IO bracket, for which a replacement was printed after the video was recorded.",

Maya Man framed AI as a tool of confrontation—not a shortcut—training on her own face and embracing distortions to expose bias and the pressure of self-image. “Because of how they’re trained, generative AI models act like a distorted reflection of the world as it already is,” she said. “For me, it was compelling to use that technology to recreate a style of imagery I’ve been surrounded by my whole life: advertising.”",

            "timestamp": "2025-09-23",
            "content": "Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.\n\nThis announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.\n\nWhile an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.\n\nStill, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.\n\nNevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.\n\nEven though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News , or add us as a preferred source , to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.
