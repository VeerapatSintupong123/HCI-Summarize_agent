    "content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nOn Friday, the White House announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications , sparking a wave of confusion and panic as companies and workers scrambled to make sense of the order.\n\nThree tech workers from across the US explained how they spent Friday night and Saturday.\n\nTwo spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking to the media; Business Insider has verified their identities.\n\n1. Sherin Sunny, a senior software engineering manager at Walmart\n\nI studied engineering back home in India and got recruited into a US-based tech company straight out of college.\n\nAfter working at the company's Indian operations for about three years, I was given the opportunity to transfer to the US because I was one of the few people familiar with the technology and their customers.\n\nI received my H-1B right away and moved to the US in 2013.\n\nThe green card backlog for Indian-born applicants has kept me on an H-1B for 12 years, with no clear end in sight.\n\nI first saw the news that the president had signed a proclamation for a $100,000 H-1B visa fee on Friday.\n\nThe last 36 hours have felt like being on call for a production outage, except the system being debugged is my career.\n\nAt first, it wasn't clear whether this applied to new H-1B applications, renewals, or even H-4 dependents, such as my wife. I was also worried about who would have to pay the fees — employees or their companies — and if firms would be willing or able to pay this fee for thousands of H-1B workers.\n\nI have been constantly checking YouTube, LinkedIn, and the White House official channels for clearer instructions.\n\nMany companies have already advised employees to avoid travel, and some friends who were abroad on H-1Bs have even been asked to return before September 21st.\n\nI saw my friends who were visiting India book last-minute flights to get back to the US after calls with their human resource teams. Everyone was stressed about them not being able to come back to the US.\n\nI was planning to travel to India for vacation, but I need to rethink that because of the uncertainty around whether current visa stampings will be impacted.\n\nMy sister, who recently gave birth, also planned to travel soon, but canceled her trip this weekend. She would have been flying back with my mother, who was visiting us, and I had to scramble to find someone who could make the trip back to India with our mom.\n\nThe White House's update that it would only impact people in the next lottery cycle brought a lot of relief.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThe anxiety of this weekend and the lack of a clear pathway to a more permanent residency are now making us rethink things.\n\nWe might decide that if it's getting harder to live on the H-1B, it's better to go back to our home country rather than being stressed out in the US.\n\n2. A Big Tech software engineer on the West Coast\n\nI moved from India to the US a decade ago to pursue a master's in engineering. I've been with my current company since graduating from the program.\n\nI received my H-1B visa on my third try in the lottery. I was anxious leading up to it and had already started exploring what my fallback options could be.\n\nI found out about the new White House order on the H-1B visa on Friday from friends who began checking up on me and whether the new rules would affect me.\n\nI opened ChatGPT and asked what exactly the order was, what criteria of H-1B holders it affected, and if there were any changes to alternative visas like the E-B1 or E-B2. More than H-1B, I was hoping there were no changes to the green card routes.\n\nI was planning a holiday in a couple of months, but I've punted planning that trip and buying tickets. It doesn't make sense for me to book something and then not be allowed to travel.\n\nThe White House's clarification about how the new rules only apply to new applicants was definitely relieving.\n\nAfter years in the US, my spouse and I have the mindset of not letting these changes affect us too much. We say that if we're here temporarily, let's make the most of it and continue to grow in our careers by making ourselves more indispensable.\n\nBut in the past year, I've started to explore ways I can build a more credible profile so that I qualify for more expedited green card options.\n\nSince the administration changed, I've also been making sure we are renewing our documents and getting our passport stampings done proactively and not waiting until the last minute.\n\nIt's made me feel the pain of new graduates and how difficult it would be for them to come to the US, pay off student loans, and get an opportunity to find an employer that would be supportive of them working here.\n\nThat will be a big challenge, at least for the next 12 months, but I'm hoping people are still supportive of the highly skilled talent that comes through.\n\n3. A software engineer in Bay Area tech\n\nI came to the US in 2018 to pursue my master's in computer engineering.\n\nI was fortunate enough to get my H-1B visa on my first attempt when I was still in graduate school.\n\nEven though I did not move from India with the expectation to stay in the US long term, I felt relieved to get the visa and thought it gave me an option to stay longer if I wanted.\n\nI've worked for multiple Big Tech companies since graduating and am currently a software engineer at a tech firm based in Silicon Valley.\n\nIt's been a tough 36 hours.\n\nI was wrapping up work on a Friday evening and solving a client issue when a friend called and started telling me about what was going on.\n\nI instantly started Googling and reading about it, trying to figure out what exactly had happened.\n\nI was troubled because I am going through an H-1B extension right now, and I thought I would be impacted.\n\nI spoke to my wife, who was out of town for the weekend, and we decided she should not travel back to India for her visa stamping. We're waiting for things to cool down before booking any tickets.\n\nAfter our call, I was frustrated, so I went to play pickleball with my friends to work out some of those emotions.\n\nI came home to a call from my mom back in India. My parents heard the news, and they asked me what was going on and why I didn't just leave the US and work somewhere else. I told them we should wait for things to settle down before making a big decision.\n\nMy friends, most of whom work at Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft, are all in the same boat. At dinner after the game, we chatted about the new order and what we should do.\n\nThat night, I watched webinars from immigration and employment lawyers to try to make sense of the proclamation. I told myself that there was not much I could do right now besides going to sleep.\n\nNew guidance from the immigration authority about existing H-1B holders has made me feel like I'm off the hook, but my wife and I are still waiting for more confirmation before making travel plans.\n\nMy reason to come to the US was that it's the heart of innovation. But I was doing well in my previous role in India before I came for my master's, and I've been thinking about whether it makes sense to live here long term.\n\nI've started thinking about options such as the Global Talent visa in the UK or opportunities in Singapore.\n\nBeing in Silicon Valley is rewarding from a work perspective, because the people here are at the top of their game, but now it feels like, is it really worth it?",
    "worker_summary": "The news article describes the initial panic and subsequent relief among H-1B visa holders following the White House's announcement of a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. Three tech workers shared their immediate anxieties, including concerns over renewals, travel restrictions, and the long-term viability of their careers in the US, with some considering leaving the country. The clarification that the fee would only apply to new applicants in the next lottery cycle, rather than existing visa holders or renewals, brought significant relief, yet underscored the ongoing stress and uncertainty associated with the H-1B system and green card backlogs.",
    "impact_trend": "The proposed $100,000 H-1B visa fee for new applications, even with the clarification that it affects future lottery cycles, has caused short-term anxiety and disrupted travel plans for current H-1B holders. For companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and INTEL, the long-term impact could be substantial. The increased cost of hiring new international talent will raise operational expenses and may deter top-tier skilled workers from choosing the US, potentially affecting innovation and global competitiveness. This could lead to a shift in hiring strategies, with companies prioritizing domestic talent or considering offshoring. While the initial market sentiment, including potential stock price impacts for these companies, likely recovered after the clarification (as of 2025-09-24), sustained challenges in talent acquisition could negatively influence long-term growth prospects and investor confidence. The competitive landscape for tech talent may also evolve, with countries offering more favorable immigration policies, such as the UK and Singapore, becoming more attractive to skilled professionals."

    "headline": "Apple takes control of all core chips in iPhone Air with new architecture to prioritize AI",
    "content": "In this article AAPL\n\nGOOGL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\niPhone Air is the big newcomer among Apple's latest lineup that went on sale Friday, but inside the slim phone's raised plateau is another new piece of hardware that signals a renewed focus on artificial intelligence. Apple's custom A19 Pro chip introduces a major architecture change, with neural accelerators added to each GPU core to increase compute power. Apple also debuted its first ever wireless chip for iPhone, the N1, and a second generation of its iPhone modem, the C1X. It's a move analysts say gives Apple control of all the core chips in its phones. \"That's where the magic is. When we have control, we are able to do things beyond what we can do by buying a merchant silicon part,\" said Tim Millet, Apple vice president of platform architecture. He sat down with CNBC at Apple Park in September for the first U.S. interview about the new chips. Until now, Broadcom was the main provider of wireless and bluetooth chips for iPhones, although Apple has made networking chips for the AirPods and Apple Watch for nearly a decade. Apple's N1 is in the entire iPhone 17 lineup and the iPhone Air. Arun Mathias, Apple vice president of wireless software technologies and ecosystems, gave CNBC an example of the N1's improved Wi-Fi functionality. \"One of the things people may not realize is that your Wi-Fi access points actually contribute to your device's awareness of location, so you don't need to use GPS, which actually costs more from a power perspective,\" Mathias said. \"By being able to do this more seamlessly in the background, not needing to wake up the application processor as much, we can do that significantly more efficiently.\"\n\nApple's new custom SoC for iPhone, A19 Pro, has neural accelerators added to the GPU cores to prioritize AI workloads Emily Park\n\nFor iPhone modems, Qualcomm has been the sole provider since 2020. That changed in February when Apple unveiled the C1 in the iPhone 16e. It's a plan first set in motion in 2019, with Apple's purchase of Intel's modem business for $1 billion. Qualcomm has long warned investors of the coming change. Qualcomm modems remain in the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, but Apple's C1X is in the iPhone Air. \"It may not be as good as Qualcomm's yet, in terms of just overall throughput and performance, but they can control it and they can make it run at lower power. So you're going to get better battery life,\" said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies, a technology research and consulting firm. He expects Apple to \"completely phase out\" Qualcomm in the \"next couple of years.\" Apple's Mathias said the C1X is \"up to twice as fast\" as the C1 and \"uses 30% less energy\" than the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 Pro. Neither Qualcomm or Broadcom saw much market impact following Apple's announcement, and both companies will maintain licensing deals with Apple for certain core technologies.\n\nAI accelerators on A19 Pro\n\nApple's three new chips come amid increasing pressure from Wall Street about the company's AI strategy. \"They probably won't ever have their own Apple model like Google or OpenAI,\" Bajarin said. \"They're still going to run those services on iPhone, right? They want the iPhone to be the best place for developers to run their AI.\" Apple has been making its own system on a chip, or SoC, since the A series launched with the iPhone 4 in 2010. The latest generation A19 Pro has a new chip architecture that prioritizes AI workloads, adding neural accelerators to the GPU cores. \"We are building the best on-device AI capability that anyone else has,\" Millet told CNBC. \"Right now we are focused on making sure that these phones that we're shipping today, or shipping soon, will be capable of all the important on-device AI workloads that are coming.\" Privacy is a major reason Apple is prioritizing on-device AI, but Millet said there's another reason, too. \"It is efficient for us. It is responsive. We know that we are much more in control over the experience,\" he said. One \"built-in AI\" feature Millet highlighted is the new front camera that uses AI to detect a new face and automatically switches to taking a horizontal photo. \"It's leveraging a full complement of almost all the capabilities in the A19 Pro,\" Millet said. Apple's original AI hardware, its Neural Engine, was first unveiled back in 2017. It was barely mentioned at the launch. Instead, it's all about adding compute power to the GPUs. \"The integration of the neural processing is reaching MacBook Pro class performance inside an iPhone,\" Millet said. \"It's a big, big step forward in ML compute. And so when you look inside the Neural Engine, for example, you have a lot of dense matrix math. We didn't have that capability in our GPU. But now we do with A19 Pro.\" Bajarin told CNBC that Apple's neural accelerators may work similarly to the tensor cores on Nvidia 's AI chips, such as the H100. \"We're integrating neural processing in a way that allows someone who's writing a program to one of those small processors, extending the instruction set so they have a new class of computer that they have access to right there, and they can switch back and forth between 3D-rendering instructions and neural-processing instructions, all seamlessly inside the same microprogram,\" Millet said. Apple's previous generation A19 SoC is in the base model iPhone 17, while the A19 Pro is in the iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max.\n\nApple's iPhone 17 Pro shown on September 9, 2025 at Apple Park in California has enhanced 3D-rendering capabilities powered by Apple's custom chip, A19 Pro, with neural accelerators added to the 6 GPU cores. Katie Tarasov\n\nFollowing overheating issues in the iPhone 15, a new \"vapor chamber\" in the Pro models keeps the custom chips cool. \"It's actually positioned in concert with where the system on a chip, the A19 Pro is positioned,\" said Kaiann Drance, Apple's vice president of worldwide iPhone product marketing. \"We think about how that all goes together, including with that forged unibody aluminum design, which is incredibly thermally conductive so that we can effectively dissipate heat with the vapor chamber, with where it's positioned with our chip. And it's even laser welded into it, which creates a metallic bond which also helps dissipate heat.\"\n\nMore chips, more U.S. manufacturing",
    "worker_summary": "Apple has introduced the iPhone Air and new custom chips: the A19 Pro SoC with neural accelerators for AI workloads, the N1 wireless chip replacing Broadcom, and the C1X modem partially replacing Qualcomm. This strategy gives Apple control over all core iPhone chips, enhancing on-device AI capabilities for privacy and efficiency, and signals Apple's commitment to its AI strategy. The company also implemented a new vapor chamber for thermal management.",
    "impact_trend": "**Apple (AAPL):** Short-term, positive market sentiment due to innovation, strategic control over core components, and a clear AI strategy. Long-term, this move strengthens its competitive advantage through deeper hardware-software integration, improved performance, and potentially higher profit margins by reducing reliance on third-party suppliers like Qualcomm and Broadcom.\n**Qualcomm & Broadcom:** Short-term, likely negative market sentiment and potential stock price pressure as Apple's new N1 wireless chip and C1X modem directly replace their components in new iPhone models. Long-term, this signifies a significant loss of business from a major customer, though licensing deals for certain technologies will remain. Qualcomm expects to be completely phased out in a couple of years.\n**NVIDIA, AMD, INTEL:** The direct impact from this specific news is minimal as Apple is developing its own custom silicon. However, the article notes Apple's neural accelerators may work similarly to NVIDIA's tensor cores, highlighting a broader industry trend towards advanced AI hardware development, which could indirectly benefit or challenge these companies depending on their own custom silicon strategies and partnerships. The overall competitive landscape for smartphones will intensify, with a strong focus on on-device AI and vertical integration."

    "headline": "Behind closed doors, our top CEOs say Trump is bad for business. Make America into America Again",
    "content": "We just hosted a large gathering of top CEOs, primarily Republicans, and you might be surprised by what we heard. While many of them have been willing to support the president out of patriotic duty—and dismay over some Democratic policies—they are increasingly questioning who truly stands to benefit from the maelstrom of chaos, fear, and confusion that he has intentionally created.\n\nThe Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute’s CEO forum gathers top political leaders with Fortune 500 CEOs for a Chatham House rules discussion where direct quotes are off the record. In Washington DC this week at the 155th gathering, as clouds swirled around the Capitol building just steps away, senators from both parties and some top Trump administration officials joined us. They had to face down the near unanimous verdict from over 100 top business leaders, representing some of the world’s largest companies and most iconic brands: Trump’s policies aren’t working. These opinions were all about business results, by the way: the reasoning was independent of personal politics or industry sector, it always came back to the bottom line.\n\nBusiness leaders at our forum worry that Trump is undermining an economic system that took decades to build and has long benefited the U.S. more than any other country, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, all for short-term gains. They see what’s happening as a hollowing out of U.S. economic foundations and institutions. In this free-to-speak environment (a loaded topic these days), they said that while they approve of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and bolstering economic and national security, they fear for America’s international standing amid the degradation of national security at the FBI, the CIA, and the Pentagon.\n\nThis widespread sentiment is directly counter to the heavily trumpeted “Dear Leader” tributes of just a handful of tech titans, who are decidedly not representative of the leadership class.\n\nSurvey says\n\nTwo-thirds of the CEOs surveyed at our event said that U.S. tariffs have been harmful to their businesses. They estimate that 80% of the tariffs have been shared equally between domestic firms and U.S. consumers, with the remainder shouldered by foreign counterparts. Businesses have attempted to limit the cost of tariffs from being passed on by rerouting supply chains, reworking operations, instituting hiring pauses, or administering large-scale layoffs. But they have limited options left as inventories built up before the tariffs took effect continue to be depleted.\n\nOne CEO of a major U.S. manufacturing company explained to the group: “If the U.S. government wants to help protect certain industries, they need to help those industries be successful. It is not just putting a bunch of tariffs in place and assuming those industries are going to get moved to the U.S. There have to be incentives … Consumers want products to be low-cost … power tools, hand tools, clothing, sneakers … Does it really make sense to be manufacturing all that in the United States? I do not believe it does. I believe there are certain industries where it does make sense … but it is not realistic to expect every industry in the world to be manufacturing products in the U.S. for the U.S.”\n\nThe leaders of Gap, Ford, Stanley Black & Decker, Nike, Conagra, Procter & Gamble, Home Depot, Best Buy, Macy’s, Target, and Walmart are but a few of the many who have outlined similar dilemmas in recent public commentary. This is the perfect opportunity for the Business Roundtable to advocate for its members in a forceful, direct challenge to the administration, but it has been perplexingly muffled. As expected, inflation has increased, reversing the downward trend that Trump inherited from the Biden administration, and the labor market continues to weaken.\n\nUnfortunately, rebuilding at home does not seem to be the solution Trump had hoped for. Fewer than half of the CEOs reported having increased investments in domestic manufacturing and other infrastructure since “Liberation Day,” and even fewer said they expected the results of their capital investments to be material.\n\nWhy everything is frozen in the Trump 2.0 economy\n\nThen there’s the uncertainty that hangs over everyone’s business during the second Trump term, and why CEOs told us that they’re watching and waiting. Across town the same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell described the “low firing, low hiring environment” in the labor market. We could have told him why.\n\nAs we saw in the first Trump administration, there is also the larger question of which major capital investment announcements are truly new, or whether they are old plans dusted off and repackaged to appease an exacting president. Past examples of widely celebrated manufacturing investments that petered out include the failed $10 billion Foxconn factory in Wisconsin. And while the president may still like to hold star-studded events celebrating the supposed hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in the U.S. because of him, the validity of some of those commitments has been called into question. Other pledges are once again encountering indefinite delays.\n\nCEOs at our event repeated stories of similar quandaries. A well-known business leader with a significant manufacturing footprint in the U.S. and abroad told the group that while they want a level playing field and support the president’s goals in that regard, their company can only offset some of the tariff-related cost increases through operating efficiencies and tax benefits from the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill.” They added that for now, the cost of tariffs still far exceeds the benefits provided by the Trump administration, drawing murmurs of agreement from the room.\n\nJust as frustrating for CEOs is the lingering sense that this entire house of cards might collapse at any moment due to a court reversal. Nearly three-quarters of all executives surveyed said they the courts are correct in saying Trump’s tariffs are illegal as implemented. If the Supreme Court agrees with those business leaders, then corporate America’s plans will be thrown into disarray again amid halting uncertainty.\n\nAnother leading CEO in the manufacturing sector, whose products are primarily made in America, explained just how debilitating this kind of uncertainty is for their company: “Manufacturing has always been a big advantage for America. So, I think bringing back manufacturing is important. The administration has it right … [We need a level] playing field in the United States … But I am always worried about what the government is going to do next. It seems like the tariffs have simmered down, but in reality, where manufacturers import from is Mexico, Canada, and China. None of those [trade deals] is settled. So, if you want to make a change in your business, you recognize tariffs are going to change in 90 days or 120 days. And I don’t want to look like a fool! So, I’m going to hold back.”\n\nThe worries of the group also extended beyond their business operations. More than three-quarters said Trump is not acting in America’s best interests by pressuring Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. The majority said they believe the president has done lasting damage to the independence of the Federal Reserve, and over 60% said they felt his recent actions of politicization are to blame.\n\nThe head of a major U.S. multinational investment bank discussed how perplexing it is to see the administration pursue an America-first agenda but then attack the independence of the Fed: “If you look at all the things that the President and this administration are doing, all of them are in service of keeping the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency … The only thing that I have not been able to square with this administration is the attack on the Fed’s independence. That is such a critical part of making sure that the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, because people trust that the Fed’s independence is the one area that is outside the presidential influence.”\n\nCredit where it’s due\n\nThe CEO forum was not entirely pessimistic. The chief executives want to see a thriving America and they were quick to congratulate President Trump when his actions reap tangible results. On CNBC’s Mad Money with Jim Cramer last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks credited Trump for encouraging their $2.5 billion partnership in Kentucky. A similar sentiment echoed at our event.\n\nCEOs told us they still believe in the promise of the U.S. and its capitalist system, but it’s hard to ignore the Trump administration’s drift toward a quasi-socialist statism, seizing ownership from private shareholders, dictating staffing, and selectively blocking moves into strategic markets based upon politics and kickbacks. Nearly three-quarters of CEOs surveyed said they were confident that U.S. free-market capitalism can compete with China’s socialist market economy in the global AI contest, and they expressed a near-unanimous discontent as the Trump administration has veered away from the capitalist system.\n\nThe gathered CEOs firmly disapproved of the president’s recent market interventions by taking equity stakes in Intel and MP Materials, requiring a revenue sharing agreement for approval of Nvidia’s and AMD’s China-sourced revenues, and mandating a golden share for authorization of the Nippon Steel takeover of a failing U.S. Steel, feeling that his actions more closely resemble those of China than the America envisioned in “Make America Great Again.”\n\nSuch flirtation with state-driven capitalism and protectionism not only leaves CEOs facing heightened uncertainty, fearfully wondering what comes next, but also providing China an opening with their suppliers and customers. At our CEO forum in March, 85% of business leaders viewed U.S. government uncertainty as a gift to China in terms a competitive opportunity. They said this week that this has proved true over the last six months.\n\nSimilarly, in March, we asked whether the U.S.-Russia-Ukrainian peace talks happening that week in Saudi Arabia would lead to a peace agreement. Nearly three-quarters said that would happen within six months. Regrettably, over three-quarters of CEOs now see relations with Russia and Ukraine as worse since Trump took office. A similar proportion of executives said they thought we are at risk of losing the momentum gained in the Middle East from the Abraham Accords.\n\nThe CEO’s dismay across foreign relations and economic issues is consistent with general opinion polling across the board. From Ipsos, Gallup, and the Associated Press to Emerson College, Quinnipiac University, and Morning Consult, each set of data set sends a clear message: America sharply disapproves of President Trump’s leadership. His approval ratings are worse than those of any other president at this point in their tenure since President George W. Bush.\n\nAfter nine months in office, there is a clear desire to return to a respect for the balance of powers in government, to reinforce international allies, to fortify independent, objective expertise of economists and scientists, to encourage freedom of voice, to stop bullying countries, cities, and companies into resentful, uneconomical compromises. In short, CEOs are calling to make America, America again.\n\nWhen one commenter compared MAGA to the Maoist movement, there wasn’t an outcry of disagreement. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",
    "worker_summary": "Top CEOs, predominantly Republican, privately express significant concern that Trump's policies are detrimental to U.S. business. They believe his administration is undermining the economic system through harmful tariffs, which are largely absorbed by domestic firms and consumers, and creating widespread uncertainty that is stifling investment. CEOs criticize Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve's independence and his market interventions, such as taking equity stakes in Intel and mandating revenue sharing for NVIDIA and AMD's China sales, viewing these actions as 'quasi-socialist' and a 'gift to China' competitively. They advocate for a return to traditional capitalist principles and international stability.",
    "impact_trend": "Short-term, increased government intervention (e.g., Intel equity stakes, NVIDIA/AMD revenue sharing) creates immediate regulatory uncertainty, potentially deterring capital investment and leading to cautious hiring. This could exert downward pressure on stock prices for these companies and broader market sentiment due to perceived instability and reduced corporate autonomy. Long-term, the 'quasi-socialist statism' and protectionist policies risk eroding U.S. global competitiveness, potentially benefiting international rivals, particularly China. For NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel, this could result in complex operating environments, restricted market access, and a less favorable landscape for long-term growth and innovation. The perceived undermining of the Federal Reserve's independence also carries risks for the U.S. dollar's global standing and overall economic stability."

    "headline": "OpenAI Eyes 2026 Launch of AI Smart Speakers, Glasses, and Wearables",
    "content": "OpenAI, the artificial intelligence powerhouse behind ChatGPT, is venturing into uncharted territory by developing its own consumer hardware, with a potential launch slated for late 2026. This move signals a strategic pivot from software dominance to integrated AI experiences, aiming to embed advanced intelligence directly into everyday devices. Drawing on a team bolstered by former Apple executives, the company is prototyping a range of innovative products that could redefine how users interact with AI.\n\nAccording to reports from PCMag, OpenAI has recruited at least 12 ex-Apple leaders to spearhead this initiative, tapping into expertise from the iPhone and iPad eras. Prototypes under consideration include a screen-free smart speaker, AI-powered glasses, a digital voice recorder, and a wearable “pin” that might function as a contextual assistant. These devices are designed to leverage OpenAI’s language models for seamless, voice-driven interactions, potentially bypassing traditional screens for more intuitive use.\n\nHiring Spree and Strategic Partnerships Fuel Hardware Ambitions\n\nThe recruitment drive extends beyond Apple alumni, with OpenAI partnering with design luminaries like Jony Ive, the former Apple chief design officer, whose influence is evident in the project’s aesthetic and functional goals. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlight industry buzz around these efforts, noting OpenAI’s collaboration with Ive’s firm LoveFrom to craft “AI-native” hardware that integrates deeply with user environments. This isn’t just about gadgets; it’s a bid to control the full stack of AI delivery, from algorithms to physical form factors.\n\nFurther bolstering this push, OpenAI has inked a manufacturing deal with Luxshare, a key supplier in Apple’s ecosystem, as detailed in coverage from Tom’s Hardware. Luxshare’s involvement suggests scalable production capabilities, with assembly potentially shifting outside China to mitigate geopolitical risks—echoing strategies seen in global tech supply chains. Industry insiders speculate this could lead to devices priced competitively, targeting mass adoption similar to smart home ecosystems.\n\nCustom Silicon and AI Optimization at the Core\n\nAt the heart of these devices lies OpenAI’s foray into custom chip design, aimed at optimizing AI inference for efficiency and speed. Recent updates from Archyde reveal partnerships with Broadcom and TSMC for producing specialized processors on a 3nm node, with mass production eyed for 2026. This chip initiative, led by ex-Google engineer Richard Ho, focuses on inference tasks—running AI models post-training—potentially reducing reliance on Nvidia’s dominant GPUs and slashing operational costs.\n\nX posts from tech analysts underscore the scale: OpenAI’s team of 40 engineers is working toward a first tape-out soon, with Broadcom committing significant IP and resources. This custom silicon could power devices that are “contextually aware,” using built-in cameras and microphones to gather real-time data, as described in reports from Built In. Such features raise privacy concerns, but they promise breakthroughs in personalized AI, like proactive assistance based on surroundings.\n\nCompetitive Pressures and Market Implications\n\nOpenAI’s hardware ambitions come amid intensifying rivalry in AI consumer tech, with competitors like Humane and Rabbit already launching AI wearables, albeit with mixed success. The company’s prototypes, including a pocket-sized, screenless device, aim to avoid pitfalls by prioritizing voice and ambient computing over clunky interfaces. News from TechRadar suggests a staggered rollout, starting with one flagship product in late 2026, followed by others into 2027.\n\nThis expansion isn’t without risks—OpenAI’s history of ambitious projects, like its earlier chip dreams scaled back from a $7 trillion vision, highlights execution challenges. Yet, by poaching talent and forging alliances, the firm is positioning itself to disrupt sectors from wearables to smart homes. As one X post from a supply chain expert noted, commitments like a $10 billion order with Broadcom signal serious intent.\n\nFuture Outlook: Innovation Meets Regulatory Hurdles\n\nLooking ahead, OpenAI’s devices could integrate with its evolving models, offering features like real-time translation or environmental analysis. However, regulatory scrutiny over data privacy and AI ethics looms large, especially for hardware that “listens” continuously. Coverage in WebProNews emphasizes the transformative potential, predicting a shift toward AI that feels omnipresent yet unobtrusive.\n\nUltimately, this hardware thrust represents OpenAI’s bet on owning the end-user experience, much like Apple’s integrated ecosystem. If successful, it could accelerate AI adoption, but failure might reinforce the company’s software-first identity. With prototypes in testing and partnerships solidifying, the tech world watches closely for what emerges in 2026.",
    "worker_summary": "OpenAI plans to launch AI-powered consumer hardware, including smart speakers, glasses, and wearables, by late 2026. This strategic shift involves recruiting ex-Apple executives, partnering with Jony Ive for design and Luxshare for manufacturing, and developing custom AI chips with Broadcom and TSMC to optimize AI inference. The goal is to embed advanced intelligence into everyday devices, offering seamless voice-driven interactions and controlling the full AI delivery stack.",
    "impact_trend": "OpenAI's move into custom silicon, aimed at optimizing AI inference, could pose a long-term competitive challenge to NVIDIA by reducing OpenAI's reliance on their GPUs. While the short-term impact on NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel's stock prices may be minimal as of 2025-09-24, a successful deployment of OpenAI's custom chips could negatively affect NVIDIA's market dominance in AI hardware for inference over time. This initiative is a positive for Broadcom, TSMC, and Luxshare due to their partnerships. Overall market sentiment will likely shift towards increased vertical integration in the AI industry, intensifying competition in consumer AI tech and potentially redefining user interaction with AI devices. OpenAI will compete with existing players like Apple, Google, Humane, and Rabbit in the smart device and wearable sectors."

    "content": "Switch the Market flag\n\nOpen the menu and switch the\n\nMarket flag for targeted data from your country of choice.\n\nfor targeted data from your country of choice.",
    "worker_summary": "The news headline trumpets a \"$5 Billion Reason to Buy Intel Stock,\" implying a significant positive development. However, the article's content is generic and unrelated to this claim, discussing \"switching the Market flag for targeted data\" rather than providing any specific details about the alleged $5 billion reason.",
    "impact_trend": "Due to the lack of specific information in the article's body regarding the '$5 Billion Reason,' a precise impact analysis is challenging. If a genuine $5 billion positive event for Intel were confirmed, it would likely lead to a short-term boost in stock price and positive market sentiment, potentially strengthening Intel's long-term financial position and competitive standing against rivals like NVIDIA and AMD. However, without details, investor enthusiasm would be limited. Recent Intel (INTC) stock performance in mid-September 2025 shows fluctuations between $24.90 and $29.58. A relevant financial news item from the last month is Morningstar maintaining a $21 fair value estimate for Intel, despite its foundry receiving outside support. This suggests a mixed sentiment from analysts, where positive strategic developments might be offset by valuation concerns. The unsubstantiated headline, therefore, is unlikely to have a direct positive impact on its own; a confirmed, detailed announcement would be required to shift market perception and stock performance significantly."

    "headline": "Behind closed doors, our top CEOs say Trump is bad for business. Make America into America Again",
    "content": "We just hosted a large gathering of top CEOs, primarily Republicans, and you might be surprised by what we heard. While many of them have been willing to support the president out of patriotic duty—and dismay over some Democratic policies—they are increasingly questioning who truly stands to benefit from the maelstrom of chaos, fear, and confusion that he has intentionally created.\n\nThe Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute’s CEO forum gathers top political leaders with Fortune 500 CEOs for a Chatham House rules discussion where direct quotes are off the record. In Washington DC this week at the 155th gathering, as clouds swirled around the Capitol building just steps away, senators from both parties and some top Trump administration officials joined us. They had to face down the near unanimous verdict from over 100 top business leaders, representing some of the world’s largest companies and most iconic brands: Trump’s policies aren’t working. These opinions were all about business results, by the way: the reasoning was independent of personal politics or industry sector, it always came back to the bottom line.\n\nBusiness leaders at our forum worry that Trump is undermining an economic system that took decades to build and has long benefited the U.S. more than any other country, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, all for short-term gains. They see what’s happening as a hollowing out of U.S. economic foundations and institutions. In this free-to-speak environment (a loaded topic these days), they said that while they approve of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and bolstering economic and national security, they fear for America’s international standing amid the degradation of national security at the FBI, the CIA, and the Pentagon.\n\nThis widespread sentiment is directly counter to the heavily trumpeted “Dear Leader” tributes of just a handful of tech titans, who are decidedly not representative of the leadership class.\n\nSurvey says\n\nTwo-thirds of the CEOs surveyed at our event said that U.S. tariffs have been harmful to their businesses. They estimate that 80% of the tariffs have been shared equally between domestic firms and U.S. consumers, with the remainder shouldered by foreign counterparts. Businesses have attempted to limit the cost of tariffs from being passed on by rerouting supply chains, reworking operations, instituting hiring pauses, or administering large-scale layoffs. But they have limited options left as inventories built up before the tariffs took effect continue to be depleted.\n\nOne CEO of a major U.S. manufacturing company explained to the group: “If the U.S. government wants to help protect certain industries, they need to help those industries be successful. It is not just putting a bunch of tariffs in place and assuming those industries are going to get moved to the U.S. There have to be incentives … Consumers want products to be low-cost … power tools, hand tools, clothing, sneakers … Does it really make sense to be manufacturing all that in the United States? I do not believe it does. I believe there are certain industries where it does make sense … but it is not realistic to expect every industry in the world to be manufacturing products in the U.S. for the U.S.”\n\nThe leaders of Gap, Ford, Stanley Black & Decker, Nike, Conagra, Procter & Gamble, Home Depot, Best Buy, Macy’s, Target, and Walmart are but a few of the many who have outlined similar dilemmas in recent public commentary. This is the perfect opportunity for the Business Roundtable to advocate for its members in a forceful, direct challenge to the administration, but it has been perplexingly muffled. As expected, inflation has increased, reversing the downward trend that Trump inherited from the Biden administration, and the labor market continues to weaken.\n\nUnfortunately, rebuilding at home does not seem to be the solution Trump had hoped for. Fewer than half of the CEOs reported having increased investments in domestic manufacturing and other infrastructure since “Liberation Day,” and even fewer said they expected the results of their capital investments to be material.\n\nWhy everything is frozen in the Trump 2.0 economy\n\nThen there’s the uncertainty that hangs over everyone’s business during the second Trump term, and why CEOs told us that they’re watching and waiting. Across town the same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell described the “low firing, low hiring environment” in the labor market. We could have told him why.\n\nAs we saw in the first Trump administration, there is also the larger question of which major capital investment announcements are truly new, or whether they are old plans dusted off and repackaged to appease an exacting president. Past examples of widely celebrated manufacturing investments that petered out include the failed $10 billion Foxconn factory in Wisconsin. And while the president may still like to hold star-studded events celebrating the supposed hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in the U.S. because of him, the validity of some of those commitments has been called into question. Other pledges are once again encountering indefinite delays.\n\nCEOs at our event repeated stories of similar quandaries. A well-known business leader with a significant manufacturing footprint in the U.S. and abroad told the group that while they want a level playing field and support the president’s goals in that regard, their company can only offset some of the tariff-related cost increases through operating efficiencies and tax benefits from the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill.” They added that for now, the cost of tariffs still far exceeds the benefits provided by the Trump administration, drawing murmurs of agreement from the room.\n\nJust as frustrating for CEOs is the lingering sense that this entire house of cards might collapse at any moment due to a court reversal. Nearly three-quarters of all executives surveyed said they the courts are correct in saying Trump’s tariffs are illegal as implemented. If the Supreme Court agrees with those business leaders, then corporate America’s plans will be thrown into disarray again amid halting uncertainty.\n\nAnother leading CEO in the manufacturing sector, whose products are primarily made in America, explained just how debilitating this kind of uncertainty is for their company: “Manufacturing has always been a big advantage for America. So, I think bringing back manufacturing is important. The administration has it right … [We need a level] playing field in the United States … But I am always worried about what the government is going to do next. It seems like the tariffs have simmered down, but in reality, where manufacturers import from is Mexico, Canada, and China. None of those [trade deals] is settled. So, if you want to make a change in your business, you recognize tariffs are going to change in 90 days or 120 days. And I don’t want to look like a fool! So, I’m going to hold back.”\n\nThe worries of the group also extended beyond their business operations. More than three-quarters said Trump is not acting in America’s best interests by pressuring Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. The majority said they believe the president has done lasting damage to the independence of the Federal Reserve, and over 60% said they felt his recent actions of politicization are to blame.\n\nThe head of a major U.S. multinational investment bank discussed how perplexing it is to see the administration pursue an America-first agenda but then attack the independence of the Fed: “If you look at all the things that the President and this administration are doing, all of them are in service of keeping the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency … The only thing that I have not been able to square with this administration is the attack on the Fed’s independence. That is such a critical part of making sure that the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, because people trust that the Fed’s independence is the one area that is outside the presidential influence.”\n\nCredit where it’s due\n\nThe CEO forum was not entirely pessimistic. The chief executives want to see a thriving America and they were quick to congratulate President Trump when his actions reap tangible results. On CNBC’s Mad Money with Jim Cramer last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks credited Trump for encouraging their $2.5 billion partnership in Kentucky. A similar sentiment echoed at our event.\n\nCEOs told us they still believe in the promise of the U.S. and its capitalist system, but it’s hard to ignore the Trump administration’s drift toward a quasi-socialist statism, seizing ownership from private shareholders, dictating staffing, and selectively blocking moves into strategic markets based upon politics and kickbacks. Nearly three-quarters of CEOs surveyed said they were confident that U.S. free-market capitalism can compete with China’s socialist market economy in the global AI contest, and they expressed a near-unanimous discontent as the Trump administration has veered away from the capitalist system.\n\nThe gathered CEOs firmly disapproved of the president’s recent market interventions by taking equity stakes in Intel and MP Materials, requiring a revenue sharing agreement for approval of Nvidia’s and AMD’s China-sourced revenues, and mandating a golden share for authorization of the Nippon Steel takeover of a failing U.S. Steel, feeling that his actions more closely resemble those of China than the America envisioned in “Make America Great Again.”\n\nSuch flirtation with state-driven capitalism and protectionism not only leaves CEOs facing heightened uncertainty, fearfully wondering what comes next, but also providing China an opening with their suppliers and customers. At our CEO forum in March, 85% of business leaders viewed U.S. government uncertainty as a gift to China in terms a competitive opportunity. They said this week that this has proved true over the last six months.\n\nSimilarly, in March, we asked whether the U.S.-Russia-Ukrainian peace talks happening that week in Saudi Arabia would lead to a peace agreement. Nearly three-quarters said that would happen within six months. Regrettably, over three-quarters of CEOs now see relations with Russia and Ukraine as worse since Trump took office. A similar proportion of executives said they thought we are at risk of losing the momentum gained in the Middle East from the Abraham Accords.\n\nThe CEO’s dismay across foreign relations and economic issues is consistent with general opinion polling across the board. From Ipsos, Gallup, and the Associated Press to Emerson College, Quinnipiac University, and Morning Consult, each set of data set sends a clear message: America sharply disapproves of President Trump’s leadership. His approval ratings are worse than those of any other president at this point in their tenure since President George W. Bush.\n\nAfter nine months in office, there is a clear desire to return to a respect for the balance of powers in government, to reinforce international allies, to fortify independent, objective expertise of economists and scientists, to encourage freedom of voice, to stop bullying countries, cities, and companies into resentful, uneconomical compromises. In short, CEOs are calling to make America, America again.\n\nWhen one commenter compared MAGA to the Maoist movement, there wasn’t an outcry of disagreement. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",
    "worker_summary": "A recent CEO forum, primarily of Republicans, reveals widespread disapproval of former President Trump's economic policies, viewing them as detrimental to business and undermining long-term U.S. economic foundations for short-term gains. CEOs criticize harmful tariffs, which largely impact domestic firms and consumers, and express concerns over pervasive uncertainty under a potential second Trump term, leading to stalled investments and hiring. They also strongly disapprove of his market interventions, such as taking equity stakes in Intel and mandating revenue sharing for NVIDIA's and AMD's China revenues, seeing these actions as quasi-socialist and reminiscent of China's economic approach, which grants China a competitive advantage. Furthermore, CEOs worry about Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence and the worsening international relations. They advocate for a return to traditional American free-market capitalism and a respect for governmental checks and balances.",
    "impact_trend": "Trump's discussed policies, including direct interventions like equity stakes in Intel and revenue sharing requirements for NVIDIA's and AMD's China-sourced revenues, are likely to cause short-term market uncertainty and negative sentiment for these companies. In the long term, these actions, perceived as a shift towards state-driven capitalism, could fundamentally alter their operating environment, reducing autonomy and potentially impacting profitability and innovation. The overall climate of uncertainty, government interference, and potential court reversals regarding tariffs would likely depress stock prices and discourage investment across the market. Moreover, CEOs believe this governmental unpredictability and departure from free-market principles provide a competitive advantage to China, potentially eroding the global standing of U.S. tech giants and altering the competitive landscape unfavorably for American companies."
