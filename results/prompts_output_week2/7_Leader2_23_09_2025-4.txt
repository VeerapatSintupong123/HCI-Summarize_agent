Sam Altman just shared an ambitious goal for rapidly scaling artificial intelligence: Build a factory capable of producing one gigawatt of new "AI infrastructure every week."  In a Tuesday blog post titled "Abundant Intelligence," the OpenAI CEO said that the "groundwork" for building out AI infrastructure is being put in place as more people rely on AI.  "Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week," Altman wrote, adding that the "execution of this will be extremely difficult" and will take years to accomplish the goal.  "In our opinion, it will be the coolest and most important infrastructure project ever," he said.  Altman's post said that "a lot" of the infrastructure will be built in the US and that more details on partners and plans to make the goal a reality will be unveiled over the next couple of months.  While Altman did not cite specific projects, one of the major vehicles that could help with Altman's scaling efforts is Stargate, a $500 billion joint AI infrastructure project between OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank.  The first Stargate data center is under construction in Abilene, Texas.  A gigawatt of AI infrastructure — enough to power 876,000 households for a year — per week could also support some of OpenAI's other recently announced ventures.  Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know  On Monday, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in Altman's startup, giving it access to at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters.  OpenAI also announced on Tuesday five more AI data center sites for its Stargate project, including the Abilene facility, which would deliver nearly 7 gigawatts of capacity.  The lingering question following both announcements is where exactly OpenAI will get the energy to power these systems.  Energy experts previously told Business Insider that getting access to the electricity needed by the Nvidia deal alone will be a challenge.  Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, described the issue to BI as the "silent bottleneck" for the tech industry's goals to scale AI.  "This is going to become a bigger and bigger issue as each year progresses," he said.  Spokespeople for OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

An executive order signed by President Donald Trump late Friday, hiking H-1B visa application fees to $100,000, sent Silicon Valley into a tailspin.  H-1B visas have become a mainstay of the tech industry, allowing companies to hire highly-skilled workers from abroad, including engineers.  Affected tech workers and corporate lawyers initially scrambled to decipher the new policies, with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta telling employees on H-1B visas to either stay in the US or return from abroad within 24 hours.  The Trump administration subsequently clarified that the fees would only apply to new applicants, not renewals or current H-1B holders.  The Trump administration said it implemented the changes to prevent system "abuses" and to encourage companies to train American workers.  Some applauded the new policy, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings, who said it could mean the end of the lottery system, given H-1Bs are capped at 85,000 workers annually. Others worried cash-strapped startups would be most severely affected, or that the executive order could counterintuitively push more jobs out of the country.  Business Insider examined publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to track which tech companies had the most H-1B visa approvals in 2025.  Bloomberg, Intel, and Nvidia declined to comment. The rest of the companies on this list did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

OpenAI and Nvidia have struck one of the biggest partnerships in AI, with Nvidia pledging to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI while supplying the compute power needed to build the company's next generation of models.  The deal, announced Monday in a letter of intent, calls for OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for AI data centers over the coming years. The first phase, one gigawatt, is scheduled for the second half of 2026 on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform, named for the late dark-matter astronomer. Nvidia's investment will grow in scale as each new system is deployed.

"Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale."

What OpenAI Found When Testing for Tricky Behavior  This partnership is notable as AI research is increasingly constrained by access to massive computing resources. By securing a long-term pipeline of Nvidia hardware, OpenAI seeks to guarantee its ability to keep pace with rivals like Google, Anthropic, Microsoft and Meta.  For Nvidia, the deal makes it more than just a supplier. By gradually taking a large stake in OpenAI, it positions itself at the center of the AI boom, buying into the biggest AI company.  "This is the biggest AI infrastructure project in history," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.  Read also: OpenAI Is Building a Teen-Friendly Version of ChatGPT  The completion of this deal will take years. If the partnership holds, it could define how quickly AI advances, what kinds of models OpenAI can deliver in the future and how accessible those models will be to the global population.  OpenAI is already using Nvidia systems in its Stargate I data center, a sprawling facility in Abilene, Texas, that is still under construction.
It's not a surprise that generative AI demands an exorbitant amount of computing power for its sophisticated advances. Top AI labs like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic frequently talk about this specific topic, especially when unveiling new products and features that cause a demand surge.  Perhaps in a bid to keep up with this trend, NVIDIA recently announced its plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The strategic partnership will allow the ChatGPT maker to build at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters, which will help train and run next-gen AI models and even potentially create the path toward superintelligence.  It's worth noting that the first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems is set to be deployed in the second half of 2026 on the Nvidia Vera Rubin platform. The chipmaker's first $10 billion investment in OpenAI will be made once both parties reach an agreement for OpenAI to purchase NVIDIA chips. However, reports suggest that NVIDIA's first $10 billion investment will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed.  While making the announcement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated:  “Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”  At the beginning of the year, OpenAI unveiled its $500 billion Stargate project, designed to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States to power its AI advances. Consequently, Microsoft lost its exclusive cloud provider status for OpenAI, though it still holds the right of first refusal.  NVIDIA and OpenAI are set to finalize the new partnership details in the coming weeks, potentially addressing the ChatGPT maker's cloud compute woes.

(Image credit: Getty Images | JOHN MACDOUGALL)  Earlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that the company was no longer compute-constrained, despite Microsoft backing out from two mega data center deals because it did not want to provide additional training support for ChatGPT.  But following the new partnership announcement between OpenAI and NVIDIA, Sam Altman indicated:  "The compute constraints that the whole industry has been, and our company in particular have been terrible. We're so limited right now in the services we can offer. There is so much more demand than what we can do."  The executive further elaborated that the compute constraints would place OpenAI in a tough spot within the next two years, forcing it to make painful tradeoffs. He indicated that the company might be forced to choose between curing cancer through research or providing free education to everyone on earth with 5-10 gigawatts of compute power.

Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Host Jimmy Kimmel speaks onstage during the 95th Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre on March 12, 2023 in Hollywood, California. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.  Hello! Jim Cramer is known to take some heat for his stock picks, but it was his bashing of GameStop's 2021 meme rally that led him to hire a bodyguard.  In today's big story, Jimmy Kimmel returns to the late-night airways.  What's on deck:  Markets: With rate cuts rolling in, are you wondering how to invest? Wall Street has some ideas.  Tech: Nvidia and OpenAI now have 100 billion reasons to help each other succeed.  Business: There still isn't a deal to keep TikTok in the US, but here's what one could look like.  But first, give a big round of applause (or don't) for my next guest.  If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.  The big story  Kimmel's comeback  Randy Holmes/ABC via Getty Images  It turns out "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" isn't going anywhere just yet.  Less than a week after being suspended "indefinitely" over comments regarding Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel is scheduled to return to late-night television tonight.  (If you're completely out of the loop, we recapped all the Kimmel drama and why it matters in Friday's newsletter.)  In a statement that probably went through more lawyers and PR people than I can count, Disney said it pulled Kimmel off the air "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country." Kimmel's comments were "ill-timed" and "insensitive," the House of Mouse added  However, after some "thoughtful conversations with Jimmy," Disney is bringing the show back.  Reactions from both ends of the spectrum quickly followed. Other late-night hosts welcomed his return. Some high-profile celebs and politicians celebrated the move as a win for free speech (California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Zohran Mamdani). Others felt Disney caved (Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet).  Kimmel's return comes with a slight caveat: Some viewers might still be unable to watch the show. That's because Sinclair, which played a key role in Kimmel's initial suspension, said it would not air the show on the 39 ABC affiliate stations it owns or controls.  Sinclair, which is the largest ABC affiliate, said it will air news programming instead and that discussions with ABC about the show's return are "ongoing." Sinclair had issued a list of demands it wanted met before bringing the show back.  Meanwhile, FCC Chair Brendan Carr referred BI to comments he made earlier Monday, in which he reiterated his agency's goal of trying to "empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities."  Carr, who last week said, "This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way," also pushed back on the idea that the FCC threatened to revoke Disney and ABC's licenses if they didn't fire Kimmel.  In the meantime, Disney finds itself in a tricky situation.  On the one hand, reinstating Kimmel is bound to make plenty of people happy. More than 400 celebrities signed a letter in support of Kimmel. There were also calls to boycott Disney due to the suspension.  But those who felt Kimmel's suspension was justified aren't likely to be happy about his return. (Whether they were supporters of Disney in the first place remains to be seen.) And even those who welcome Kimmel's return might still resent Disney for initially suspending him.  And then there's the question of late night. The TV model for late-night shows was already fragile long before last week. But now that Kimmel and his show have become a lightning rod, any decision about the show going forward will be viewed with a magnifying glass and likely lead to more controversy.  3 things in markets  Bank of America's Merrill and Wells Fargo are offering spot bitcoin ETF's to some of their clients as the investment vehicle surges in demand, Bloomberg Reported Hannes P Albert/picture alliance via Getty Images  Crypto prices tanked after hordes of traders rushed to liquidate their positions.

This includes OpenAI constructing "at least 10 gigawatts" of AI data centers running Nvidia systems. Nvidia's stock jumped as much as 5% on news of the agreement, helping to push the S&P 500 to a fresh record high.

STORY: From the latest manoeuvring in the global AI race... to the electric aircraft reaching for the skies.  :: Tech Weekly  This is Tech Weekly.  A tie-up between two of the highest-profile players in the global AI race is on the way.  Nvidia is to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply it with data center chips.  The deal gives chipmaker Nvidia a financial stake in the world's most prominent AI company.  The investment gives OpenAI the cash and access it needs to buy advanced chips that are key to maintaining its dominance.  But rivals of both companies may be concerned the partnership will undermine competition.  Meta has launched its latest smart glasses, and they are its first consumer-ready spectacles with a built in display.  Dubbed the Meta Ray-Ban Display, they will go on sale later this month priced from $799.  Boss Mark Zuckerberg presented the new gadget at the firm’s annual event for developers in California.  "The display is large enough to watch a video or read a thread of messages. It appears in one eye it's slightly off center, so it doesn't block your view and it disappears after a few seconds when it's not in use so it doesn't distract you.”  Huawei has outlined its long-term chip plans for the first time .  It's said it will launch some of the world's most powerful computing systems - underscoring China's drive to wean itself off foreign semiconductor suppliers like Nvidia.  In an announcement that broke years of secrecy about its chips business, Huawei detailed timelines for its Ascend artificial intelligence chips and Kunpeng server chips.

Nvidia will provide at least 10 gigawatts (millions of GPUs) to OpenAI  Deal could be worth up to $100 billion, Nvidia says  Nvidia has lifted the wraps off a multi-billion dollar investment into ChatGPT maker OpenAI as part of its plans to take the company’s AI infrastructure to the next level.  At least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems are set to power OpenAI’s next-generation models, which equates to millions of GPUs, with Nvidia ploughing up to $100 billion into OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed.  “NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.”  OpenAI scores massive Nvidia deal  The two companies confirmed that the first gigawatt, using the Vera Rubin platform, could come online as early as the second half of 2026.  In its announcement, OpenAI named Nvidia as its “preferred strategic compute and networking partner,” noting the two companies will “co-optimize their roadmaps” to align OpenAI models and infrastructure with Nvidia hardware and software.  In the near-three years since its public preview launch, ChatGPT and OpenAI’s other AI tools have amassed over 700 million weekly active users, and continued growth mandates further expansion.  This initiative has been described as the biggest AI infrastructure project in history, and it could lead to next-generation superintelligence.  Are you a pro?

Arm has been slowly picking up pace in the last two decades, but the momentum is only growing stronger.
Big tech is capable of throwing around some eye-watering amounts of cash. As you may recall, Nvidia announced $46.7 billion total revenue during its Q2 2025 earnings call. That's not just a lot of moolah, but serious spending power.  As such, this week, Nvidia announced it will be investing $100 billion into OpenAI. Part of this mountain of money will go towards supplying the steward of ChatGPT with data centre chips. Details have yet to be finalised, but a letter of intent signed by the two companies announced plans to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for use in OpenAI's data centres.  The two companies were hardly strangers to begin with, but this latest deal gives Nvidia a stake in one of its biggest customers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI will eventually take the form of non-voting shares in the company. OpenAI will then use the resulting cash flow to buy the aforementioned AI chips. Ultimately, this latest pledge of $100 billion makes last week's surprising news that Nvidia would be putting $5 billion into Intel look like a drop in the bucket.  Once this most recent deal is finalised, sources close to the company claim the plan is for Nvidia to invest an initial sum of $10 billion, followed by a hardware rollout sometime towards the end of 2026. The first gigawatt of power will likely take to the stage of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin AI compute platform, which was first revealed back in March.  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a statement that it was all about maintaining a competitive edge in an increasingly crowded field, saying, "Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale."  But Nvidia spending money on OpenAI so OpenAI can then buy Nvidia hardware has raised some concerns; if this flow of cash looks a little circular to you, you're not the only one concerned about the potential shape of things to come.  Speaking to Reuters, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon commented, "On the one hand this [deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built. On the other hand the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further."

Still though, the proposed 10 gigawatt data centres will demand power equivalent to the needs of 8 million U.S. households; despite Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's suggestion that AI customers 'pace themselves' and other major big tech players looking to nuclear to meet AI's power demands, there may come a time when such a power imbalance can no longer be ignored.
OBS Studio 32.0 has been released. The update sees this streaming and screen recording stable gain a nifty new plugin manager, change a few of its default settings and expand its support for NVIDIA RTX effects.  The new plugin manager is described as “basic” because it is: it shows a list of installed plugins with a checkbox to enable/disable, but ‘Browse’ and ‘Update’ options are greyed out (those options being there suggests it will be possible to find and install plugins in OBS directly).  OBS Studio 3.20 increases the default bitrate from 2500 to 6000 Kbps.  The old value was decided upon a decade ago, and expectations in quality have shifted. OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.  Users with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.  Hybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.  On Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.  Other notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:  Opt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)  Experimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs  Audio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc  --disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed  Plugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded  Beyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.  Though a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.  How to Install OBS Studio 32.0  OBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).  On Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.  There’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).  To install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio  Then, install OBS Studio using apt :  sudo apt install obs-studio  Finally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team.

What I like about the specs is the numerous options for storage (one eMMC and another NVME M2 slot), the 2 Gigabit Ethernet port (a single one this time, so don’t expect to make it into a router), the 4 USB ports (sufficient to connect keyboard, mouse, and something else).  On paper, the specs are impressive with the fairly recent Rockchip processor. There is a NPU as well, but don’t expect to have it supported easily in Linux, even on AMD the NPU support is shaky at best. For this SBC, it involves cross-compilation, custom binaries before you can exploit a model on this board.  This is what the layout of the board looks like:  Here’s the back view:  Now you should be aware of the following:  Mobile GPUs don’t support OpenGL, only the OpenGLES subtype. You can get some Vulkan support (1.2), but as we will see later, hardware support is unfortunately not there yet.  The board is priced at around 130 USD for the 16GB version (it seems to be the main one being sold right now). Which is roughly equivalent to the Raspberry Pi 5 price for the same amount of memory. However, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra board is much more powerful in comparison, so depending on your use case, the Orange Pi 5 Ultra would represent a better value for money.  Of course, the usefulness of such a board depends entirely on the quality of the software support.  Software Support  A Full Ubuntu Experience  There are many images available for this board. Ubuntu, Debian, Arch… at first I was wondering which one to go for. Even in each category you have a bunch of different images:  Focal (20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version.  (20.04 LTS), either desktop with xfce or server version. Jammy (22.04 LTS), desktop with GNOME or Xfce, or a server version. But it goes deeper than that. You get two different kernel available. An old 5.10 kernel or a 6.1.  I went for the Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS with the 6.1 kernel, the desktop build using Xfce (GNOME was not available for that kernel).  As you can see, the Ubuntu 24.04 distro is missing from the list, and this is a shame, since this is a board released late 2024. I contacted OrangePi and they mentioned that they would eventually release a 24.04 version, but there was no clear timeline for that.  To install Ubuntu, you use dd or Balena Etcher to image a micro-SD card first, and then you get some helper scripts (using ncurses) that make it super easy to image either a eMMC chip, or a NVME drive that’s attached to the board (I don’t recommend using a micro-SD card as the main media).  Once you reach the desktop, you will see that things work pretty much as expected. Wifi, Bluetooth, and even the HDMI port could properly recognize my Ultra Wide Screen and display the full resolution. This was an issue with the RV2 board from Orange Pi (probably hardware/drivers related) but on ARM64 it seems like things are much more robust.  GPU Support?  Sadly, but this was almost expected, there does not seem to be any kind of GPU support in the version that I have chosen. A quick check with glxgears confirms that there is just a software pipe for rendering.  This being said, the software rendering is very very fast - you can see that there’s a lot of power under the hood on the CPU side. The same glxgears was only running at 35 FPS on the RV2, here it’s 10 times faster!  There is however hope. It looks like there are efforts to mainline the GPU drivers on the Linux kernel, so when this happens you could expect a standard distro like ARMbian to offer full support of the GPU capabilities. Too early to say, but we will come back on that later.  Because of the lack of GPU support, I will be skipping the gaming aspects of this board for now. I will revisit it in another article once we have proper GPU drivers, to actually see what we can expect from this SBC once we have the Mali ready for some action.  Applications  I installed and tried bunch of things:  Chromium is installed by default and works very well, but is limited to the 110 version which is old by now. Using Flathub and Flatpak I could install a much more recent version, that has proper extensions support. Firefox works fine, too - its fork, Zen browser, also works via Flatpak but is very slow for some reason. I also tried a non-Flatpak install for Zen, but it was also slow, so it’s probably not related to Flatpak itself.  This is now a good time to talk about Flatpak. When I was reviewing the RV2 board which sports a RISC-V chip, I remarked that there are very few Flatpaks that actually support that architecture. So in effect, while flatpak is supposed to work regardless of the architecture, if you don’t have any binary built for your architecture, you won’t be able to make much use of Flathub and the like. For ARM64, the support is not 100% either, but there is a massive footprint of applications that support ARM64. I tried quite a lot of applications and I was constantly surprised wow, they even have ARM64 for that!. I surmise that this is the effect of having a mainstream ARM64 desktop machine out there running Linux with the Macbooks equipped with the M chipsets, running Asahi. (and a lot of folks who have such machines being developers themselves, of course).  While most applications worked with the RV2 (which is roughly equivalent to a Raspberry Pi 3), it showed its limits when you wanted to do video editing for example. Kdenlive and Openshot were barely working. Here, with the OrangePi 5 Ultra, Kdenlive works like a breeze and had no issue dealing with a bit of video editing and rendering. The final video render was certainly not as fast as what you’d expect on a regular X86_64 platform, but you know, it’s workable if you are not dealing with very long videos (also, avoid 4k). We are certainly dealing with a much more capable SOC here.  Out of curiosity, I tried some more professional applications like Dbeaver (for databases interactions), and it worked as expected.  The same with Memgraph (graph database), used via Docker (since they don’t have a client for ARM64, I used the web client instead). Of course, I did not try to load a massive graph database with this, but the system was very responsive and usable. Honestly, very impressive to see Memgraph running so well on a SBC.  I wasted a lot of time trying to make R and Rstudio for ARM64 work togeher from the distro (without success, there was some kind of issue with the tools base package not being recognized), until I switched gears and used a Docker version of R/Rstudio instead. Once again this proved to work very well (Rstudio is a Java application so the browser IDE is basically identical).  The only appplication that did not work well was Blender. It launched, but afterwards it was a slideshow with 3 seconds between an interaction and the refresh of the screen. I assume this is because Blender requires GPU support even for its innerworkings, and since we don’t have GPU acceleration in this OS, it’s just not going to cut it.  But honestly… that’s it! Everything else I tried worked as expected on a usual desktop or laptop. At no time did I feel this is too slow, I can’t wait to stop my review - instead, if you told me that I would only have that SBC to do regular work, well, I could totally see myself living with it for 90% of my use cases.  Very impressive to see this kind of performance in this form factor. And this is a board running only at 1.8 Ghz! I can only imagine how things will improve once they go to a better lithography and manage to increase the frequency of the CPU.  Temperature Control  The temperature does rise a little when using all cores at once, but it remains at a manageable level. When doing some bursts of compilation the temperature rises up to about 78~80C, and when running LLMs on the CPU (full 100% CPU usage), we get up to 84, 85C.  This looks like the hard limit - I am not sure if the SBC goes into throttling then, but I did not observe higher temperature. In any cases, in all situations (apart from Blender), the system remained very responsive.  Power Draw  I don’t have a way to measure power draw, but according to AndroidPIMP you can expect an idle power draw between 3W and 5W, and an usage under load on average around 10W. Since the power source can produce 25W maximum, I guess you can imagine the board going up to 15W or so in spikes. In any case, its low power profile and the fact that the temperature remains well under control tells me that this is a great little machine for a server.  AI - LLM Performance  For this part, I compiled both Ollama and llama.cpp and run some benchmarks on llama.cpp. I tried only smaller models, as I had low expectations that it would be running at usable speeds. The results are below, produced with the llama-bench command.  model size params backend threads test t/s gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 pp512 23.37 ± 0.94 gemma3 1B Q4_K - Medium 762.49 MiB 999.89 M CPU 8 tg128 2.49 ± 0.62 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 pp512 36.34 ± 1.78 granite 3B Q4_0 1.36 GiB 2.53 B CPU 8 tg128 5.06 ± 0.10  For dense models like Gemma 1B, it’s kind of slow and not really good for chatting. If you plan to use LLMs with this, however, MOE models like granite 3.1 3B work at a decent speed (5 tokens by second, not bad). I would certainly prefer 10 tokens by second minimum, but this is what we have to live with, at least when using the CPU mode. It’s certainly a lot more usable than the RV2 review previously.  Once we have a capable Vulkan driver working, I wonder if Vulkan can be leveraged to increase the token generation speed on this SBC. It works well on AMD configurations because they can share the overall memory with the iGPU. On ARM, I am not sure if the same flexibility exists.  Performance  The go-to suite to evaluate performance is Geekbench, because it can provide some comparison between the speed of similar tests across different architectures. Here, let’s compare it against another flagship ARM64 board, the Raspberry Pi 5 running at 2.4 ghz.  Spec OrangePi 5 Ultra Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.1 Operating System Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) Processor ARM ARMv8 @ 1.80 GHz, 1 Processor, 8 Cores ARM ARMv8 @ 2.40 GHz, 1 Processor, 4 Cores” Memory 8 GB model 8 GB model  Single Core Performance  Both boards end up with a very similar performance on average in single core tests.  There are some differences, but it’s fairly marginal.  Multi-core performance  When doing multi-threaded, multi-core workflows, this is where we see the 8 processors that are available on the Orange Pi 5 Ultra shine.  Its performance surpasses the Raspberry Pi 5 in almost all activities, and usually by a good 30% advantage.  Performance overview  As you can see, for parallel workloads, this board is much better than the Raspberry Pi 5.  Now let’s look at the potential use of such boards as servers.  Server Use  You can use this board as a server, of course. You have several distro images just for the server use, too. Docker works very nicely with this SBC, and unlike what we have seen for the RV2 and the general Risc-V ecosystem where there are very few Docker images available for that architecture, the ARM64 scene is completely different.  Here, it’s almost rare to find a Docker image where there is no ARM64 build. Not surprising since ARM64 is a thing on servers nowadays - Amazon has famously pushed their own ARM Gravitron servers as an option to reduce cloud computing costs. So most companies and providers operating on the cloud pretty much need to have ARM64 builds.  On the server, you also don’t need to care as much about the lack of GPU support since you are running headless, so any distro provided by OrangePi should do: Debian, Ubuntu, or even Arch.  Since this is a board that operates at low wattage and passive cooling, it’s an excellent choice if you want to build a small server for the home. For a NAS use case I would probably go for the RV2 instead since it has more storage ports, but this one could also work considering you can have an eMMC drive together with another M2 drive (NVME) at the same time.  Verdict  Little boards that were previously only used for fun or small projects have come a long way. Desktop environments were rarely usable before even on the later iterations of the Raspberry Pi. Things changed a couple of years ago, and the Raspberry Pi 5 and this Orange Pi 5 Ultra fall into a category where you could actually use them as real, daily general purpose computers and not be bothered by their responsiveness, or their performance. Not only will it work well for server use, but it can do desktop work without sweating either.  Price wise, the 16 GB version is competitive. If you want similarly specced Celeron-equipped mini-PCs you would probably need a configuration with a N100 processor (that seems to be faster than the RK3588), but that is more expensive. So the value for money of this SBC seems to be pretty good at the moment, even for the 16G configuration.  The only negative points are the moment are:  lack of recent distro images (Ubuntu 24.04 would be nice)  lack of GPU support (potentially because I was using the 6.1 kernel?)  incomplete mainline support  which may be some killer aspects depending on your use case. The wide availability of software for ARM64 on Flatpak and Docker somewhat mitigates such issues for now.  The real solution will come when the RK3588 support will be properly mainlined. Currently only parts of it are supported but it’s not complete and bug-free from what I could read. I am following news around the Arch-based BredOS as they are actively working on bringing proper support for this chip. Once this is done, the benefits should be apparent such as:  Much better Vulkan performance (compared to proprietary driver)  Proper video acceleration in browsers like Chrome  No more patches to chase from one kernel to the next!  Once there are news in this regard (hopefully in 2025) I plan to revisit my review of this SBC.  Practical Details  If you are interested to grab one, there are currently a few shops that sell it online:  Aliexpress store: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB at 220 USD (without shipping). Expensive if you are in the US.  Amazon OrangePi Official: Orange Pi 5 Ultra 16GB sells for 158 USD on Amazon.com. (without shipping) - the cheaper option.  There are probably some more third parties depending on where you are based in the world.

Final note, we have been provided with a review unit of this SBC by OrangePi themselves for this article.
As a proud American company, Meta is committed to playing its part in ensuring the United States and its closest allies have the best tools at their disposal to defend themselves and keep their citizens safe.  Last year, we began making our Llama models available to US government agencies, including those working on defense and national security applications, as well as to private sector partners supporting their work. Llama is particularly well-suited to these sensitive use cases because, as an open source platform, it can be securely downloaded and deployed without the need to transfer sensitive data through third-party AI providers. Governments can also fine-tune Llama models using their own sensitive national security data, host them in secure environments at various levels of classification, and deploy models tailored for specific purposes on-device in the field.  Since late last year, we have also made Llama available for national security use cases to America’s Five Eyes security partners — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK — and their private sector partners. We are now expanding this access to a number of key US democratic allies in Europe and Asia: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, as well as NATO and European Union institutions.  Llama has been used to help develop advanced AI tools for the US military and national security agencies, enhancing decision-making, mission-specific capabilities, and operational efficiency. For example, Meta is working with the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command on a pilot project to demonstrate how AI and technologies like augmented and virtual reality can help to speed routine repairs and help the Army get equipment back into the field more quickly.  To bring Llama-based solutions to these US allies, our partners include Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Anduril, Ask Sage, Booz Allen, C3 AI, Circus, Cyberspatial, Databricks, EdgeRunner AI, Google Cloud, IBM, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Palantir, Scale AI, Snowflake, and others.  We are also supporting US national security through our work developing augmented and virtual reality technologies. Through our partnership with Anduril, we are developing a range of wearable products to help maintain America’s technological edge. This program represents the largest effort of its kind to equip US soldiers with enhanced perception and decision-making capabilities.  In a world where geopolitical power and national security are deeply intertwined with economic output, innovation, and growth, the widespread adoption of open source models like Llama will be essential to maintaining US and allied AI leadership and ensuring our shared values underpin the systems and standards adopted elsewhere. This is recognized by the US government in its AI Action Plan for America, which Meta endorses.  It is the responsibility of countries leveraging AI for national security to deploy AI ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with relevant international law and fundamental principles, principles the United States and many of its allies have committed to in the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy.  We are taking a step-by-step approach to extending access to Llama for defense and national security purposes, and will consider adding further countries in the future in consultation with the US government.

This article first appeared on GuruFocus.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials) won fresh support on Wall Street after Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating and set a $200 price target, pointing to continued growth in artificial intelligence chips and server CPUs. The target represents about 27% upside from current levels.  Arya said AMD's share gains in AI and data-center markets outweigh slower trends in cyclical businesses such as consoles and embedded chips. The company's accelerated roadmap includes the MI325X entering mass production this year and the MI350 coming later in 2025, followed by a new AI server platform in 2026.  The call comes as investors digest Nvidia's $5 billion investment and product pact with Intel, a move seen as strengthening competition in data-center and PC processors. Arya argued the deal could actually benefit AMD, since both companies rely on the x86 ecosystem that AMD also licenses, making the market more robust overall.  AMD stock is up more than 30% this year, though it has been volatile, trading between $76 and $187 over the past 12 months. Analysts hold a Moderate Buy consensus on the stock, with an average target of $188.
The MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is, you guessed it, a dedicated AI laptop. It excels at delivering increased productivity when doing word processing, photo editing, and some 3D modelling, but as soon as I tried to do anything seriously demanding, I wished I had a laptop with a discrete GPU. Aside from performance, this is a good-looking laptop that boasts a bright and vibrant IPS display.  Why you can trust Creative Bloq Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  Another month, another "AI" laptop. This time, it's the MSI Prestige A16 AI+.  MSI has been relentless in its pursuit of the best AI laptop to appeal to people looking for good graphic design laptops, releasing three different models in the past 18 months alone. I’ve reviewed a number of them, from the ultra-portable Prestige 13 AI+ Evo that lacked power to the balanced Prestige 14 AI and the surprisingly capable Prestige 16 AI.  These three reviews show that the world of AI laptops is still very much hit and miss. If you're seriously into AI image generation, are running AI-powered effects in video editing, or need a finely tuned machine for 3D rendering, then you're likely to come up short. More often than not, dedicated creative workflows will still benefit from dedicated machines.  So, can the new MSI Prestige A16 AI+ finally buck the trend and deliver on its promise? Let's find out.  Key specifications  Swipe to scroll horizontally Specs as tested CPU: AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 365 NPU: 50 NPU TOPS (73 total AI TOPS) Graphics: AMD Radeon™ 880M Memory: 32GB LPDDR5 Storage: 1TB Screen size: 16 inches Screen type: IPS-Level Resolution: QHD+(2560x1600) Refresh rate: 165 Hz Colour gamut: 100% DCI-P3 Brightness: 400 nits Ports: 2x USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, microSD card reader, audio combo jack Wireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v5.4 Dimensions: 358 x 258.55 x 16.9 -17.35 mm Weight: 1.9 kg  (Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)  Design, build and display  • Modern aesthetic with tapered edge  • IPS-panel 100% DCI-P3 and 16:10 ratio display  The MSI Prestige A16 AI+ makes a strong first impression with its minimalist silver aluminium chassis, which exudes a sleek and professional aesthetic. The base panel consists of a number of design touches that attempt to reduce any sense of bulk and clunkiness that is often associated with 16-inch laptops. These include a tapered edge, a recessed keyboard panel, and a hinge that drops the display down to desk level.  The laptop's 16-inch IPS panel might not be as superior as an OLED alternative, but it's still pretty bright and vibrant. Using it to edit photos and videos was a joy, even in a light-filled room. It also delivers an impressive level of colour accuracy as well as high levels of contrast. Additionally, the 16:10 aspect ratio provides valuable vertical screen real estate, which is excellent for video timelines and document editing.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors  The display also includes the professional DCI-P3 colour space with 100% coverage. This will be sufficient for most users wanting to make the most of HDR content, but if your work requires an even broader range of colours, then you'll need a display that supports either Adobe RGB or Rec. 2020.  The keyboard is relatively comfortable, although the size of the keys and distance of travel between keys is a little more than I would have liked for an optimum experience. The trackpad is central to the keyboard, which I like. However, for any task requiring precision, such as graphic design or detailed video editing, a dedicated mouse remains a necessity. The base panel also includes a fingerprint reader to the side, which allows for a quick and easy login.  Weighing in at 1.9 kg (4.2 lbs), the laptop is definitely at the lighter end of the spectrum for 16-inch laptops. This makes it easy to pop in your bag and carry it with you wherever you go. Given that it could cope with some extra weight, I think MSI could have bulked out the display panel to make it less flexible. I want my laptops to be as robust as possible, and even though the base is super durable, the display panel needs more work.  In terms of external ports, MSI has opted for a pretty simple offering with two USB-Cs, a USB-A, an HDMI, a microSD card reader, and an audio combo jack. For creatives, the most valuable feature is the two Thunderbolt 4-enabled USB-C ports. These not only provide fast 40Gbps data transfer speeds for quickly moving large video and photo files but also support Power Delivery 3.0, allowing you to charge the laptop and connect high-resolution external displays simultaneously.  Design score: 4/5  (Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)  Features  • Supercharged performance thanks to AI smarts  • An IPS display designed with creatives in mind  The MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is designed with several features specifically targeted at creative professionals and content creators. These features focus on performance, display quality, and AI-powered tools.  1. AI-powered performance  To begin with, the laptop is equipped with a powerful AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor, which includes a Neural Processing Unit (NPU). More on how this performs in the dedicated performance section.  The MSI AI Engine will automatically detect what you're doing (content creation, work, entertainment, etc.) and adjust the hardware settings for optimal performance. I appreciated this, especially when I was flipping between Photoshop, Premiere Pro, SolidWorks, and other applications.  Additionally, the laptop provides access to Copilot+, Live Captions, Cocreator, and Recall. These combined provide a set of tools which will boost and enhance your productivity (if you use them wisely). Integration into dedicated creative workflows is still lacking, but if you embrace what's there already, then you'll notice some performance benefits.  2. QHD+ Display  Most of this was covered in the above design section, but it's worth stating that the display is specifically set up for creative professionals. The 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, 16-inch QHD+ resolution (2560 x 1600), and 165Hz refresh rate find their benefits across rendering, animation, video editing, and office applications. I found using the display an absolute joy, no matter whether I was browsing the web, doing some word processing, or getting knee-deep in video editing.  3. Connectivity  USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 4 compatibility and a MicroSD card reader will help creatives to transfer files quickly and efficiently. I loved how quickly I was able to move files onto the machine, no matter whether I was dealing with MB or GB. This is a machine that can handle large files with ease.

The advertising makes them sound like their AI technology will provide you with instant results, no matter the application and workflow. Maybe I'm overstating it, but it certainly feels like that to me.  That's why I was left pleasantly surprised by the Prestige A16 AI+. The lack of a discrete GPU was problematic for 3D rendering and colour grading, but the CPU and integrated GPU actually did a great job in Photoshop and Premiere Pro. The fact that it was able to handle complex video compositions and layered effects was not what I expected.  Alongside photo and video editing, I also spent a lot of time browsing the web, watching videos, and carrying out general-purpose office work. The laptop served up a responsive and snappy experience in this area, which further contributed to the laptop's impressive performance.  I was also impressed by the laptop's ability to perform across a broad range of applications. I think this was in part thanks to the MSI AI Engine that was adjusting hardware settings behind the scenes. It really does excel in this role, as demonstrated by its Geekbench scores. With a reasonable multi-core score, this laptop is good at multi-threading, but not to the degree of something like the ASUS ProArt P16 (2025).  The laptop's battery life, however, proved to be a significant limitation, lasting a relatively short eight hours. That means you'll either need to consign it to a permanent desk setup or be happy carrying the charger around with you. I thought I could overcome this by utilising a lightweight third-party charger, but the apparent lack of wattage meant that the system slowed to a total standstill. By way of comparison, you'll get similar battery performance on the ASUS V16 and Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.  With all this considered, the Prestige A16 AI+ is a high-performing laptop for most types of creative applications. Keep in mind, though, that if you need a laptop for more demanding graphics applications, you'll want a device with a discrete GPU.  Performance score: 4/5  (Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)  Price  The MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is a mid-range to high-end laptop that costs $1,399/£1,499, although there are often limited-time deals around that bring the price down considerably. If you'd prefer an OLED display with a higher resolution (UHD+ 3840x2400) then a model with that spec is also available.  In terms of comparison, you might also like the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i Gen 9, although it'll set you back at least £1,635. If you'd like something a bit more middle of the road, then the Dell XPS 16 is a great alternative, especially if you're keen on customising your own machine.  Value score: 4/5  Who is it for?  • Content creators who don't need a discrete GPU  Hopefully it goes without saying, but if you're into 3D modelling, animation, rendering, high-resolution video editing, and colour grading, then you'll need a laptop with a discrete GPU. If you're creating other types of content, performing low-demand creative tasks, or needing a laptop that can boost your productivity, then the MSI Prestige A16 AI+ is well worth a look.  Swipe to scroll horizontally MSI Prestige A16 AI+ score card Attributes Notes Rating Design: A modern aesthetic with a bright IPS display. Also perfect for portability. 4/5 Features: AI-powered performance takes centre stage, and at times it delivers, but not always. 4/5 Performance: Great for most creative projects, but the lack of a discrete GPU will be a problem for some. 4/5 Value: A relatively affordable laptop, but keep in mind it doesn't have a discrete GPU. 4/5  (Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)  Buy it if...  You value AI-accelerated performance  You want a bright and accurate display  You need excellent portability  Don't buy it if...  You need a discrete GPU  You're only going to be web browsing
OBS Studio 32.0 has been released. The update sees this streaming and screen recording stable gain a nifty new plugin manager, change a few of its default settings and expand its support for NVIDIA RTX effects.  The new plugin manager is described as “basic” because it is: it shows a list of installed plugins with a checkbox to enable/disable, but ‘Browse’ and ‘Update’ options are greyed out (those options being there suggests it will be possible to find and install plugins in OBS directly).  OBS Studio 3.20 increases the default bitrate from 2500 to 6000 Kbps.  The old value was decided upon a decade ago, and expectations in quality have shifted. OBS’ devs note that “…a lot of users who use OBS for recording don’t touch the default settings and end up with a 2.5 mbps recording which looks terrible”.  Users with NVIDIA RTX GPUs gain Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for RTX Audio Effects, which the release notes say improves noise suppression for speech and optimises other NVIDIA effects. Plus, the RTX Background Removal now has a “chair removal” option.  Hybrid MP4/MOV is now the default recording format for new profiles, having been (successfully) trialled in beta previously. New default settings have been applied for AMD encoders to improve ‘perceptual quality for AVC/HEVC/AV1’.  On Linux, OBS Studio 32.0 improves PipeWire video capture by adjusting the render technique used to capture screen sources. The pull request has detail on why users on Linux saw gamma/brightness issues when adding effects.  Other notable changes in OBS Studio 32.0:  Opt-in automatic crash log upload (Windows and macOS)  Experimental Metal renderer on Apple Silicon Macs  Audio deduplication logic improved across nested scenes, etc  --disable-shutdown-check launch flag removed  Plugins built for newer versions of OBS Studio are no longer loaded  Beyond that, there is are an array of bug fixes to resolve various errors, crashes, missing chapter markers, plugin issues and so on – many issues rather specific to certain setups or situations.  Though a modest update compared to the OBS Studio 31.1 release from July, OBS Studio 32.0 refines and extends what already works, while the new plugin manager (and some other new widget additions) lay foundations for bigger changes still to come.  How to Install OBS Studio 32.0  OBS Studio is free, open-source software for Windows, macOS and Linux. Download the latest version for Windows, macOS or Linux from the OBS Project website or from GitHub (a DEB for Ubuntu/Linux Mint is linked in the assets section).  On Linux, there is also the OBS Studio from Flathub — an official, verified Flatpak maintained by the OBS Project themselves, who consider it to the ‘recommended’ way to install OBS Studio on Linux.  There’s also an official OBS Project PPA providing this, and future updates via more traditional packaging methods. The PPA supports Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and above (but not, as of writing, Ubuntu 25.10 as it’s yet to be released).  To install OBS Studio from the PPA, first add the PPA:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio  Then, install OBS Studio using apt :  sudo apt install obs-studio  Finally, there is an unofficial OBS Studio snap, a modified build with other changes, including a handful of AI plugins, filters, and other tweaks. The Snap is not officially supported by OBS Studio, and any issues with it should be reported to the Snapcrafters team.
Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.  This announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.  While an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.  Still, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.  Nevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.  Even though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.

Geopolitical tensions, particularly export bans and increased scrutiny from China, pose a substantial risk to market access and could necessitate costly product adaptations. Simultaneously, intensified competition from established players like AMD and emerging challengers like Huawei demand continuous innovation and strategic agility. While Nvidia's current trajectory is overwhelmingly positive, navigating these external pressures and sustaining its innovative edge will be crucial for maintaining its "unrivaled" status in the long term.



**Candidate Summary (The text to be evaluated):**
"### Summary Report of Financial News (23/09/2025)\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nOn September 23, 2025, Nvidia announced an unprecedented $100 billion investment in OpenAI, solidifying a strategic partnership to build massive AI infrastructure, including a 1 gigawatt AI data center project and the larger $500 billion \"Project Stargate.\" This move follows Microsoft's reported withdrawal from previous data center deals with OpenAI and underscores Nvidia's commitment to securing its dominant position in the AI chip market, despite assuring the market that GPU supply to other customers will not be impacted. Historically, Nvidia has been strategically locking in OpenAI as a partner, investing heavily, and maintaining a strong financial outlook with projections of $400 billion in AI revenue by 2028. Concurrently, Intel faces ongoing challenges despite a recent $5 billion partnership with Nvidia for chip production, which analysts view as a temporary measure rather than a near-term turnaround. Further impacting Intel, Citi downgraded its shares, and the company announced a reduction in day-zero game driver support for recent chips, signaling strategic shifts. Across the industry, a significant long-term trend is the increasing ascendancy of Arm-based computing, posing a direct threat to the traditional x86 dominance of both Intel and AMD. While AMD also saw an analyst target raise to $200 on AI gains, both x86 players must adapt to this evolving landscape, which could lead to significant market share shifts.\n\n### Key Insight\nHistorical data showed Nvidia proactively engaging in strategic partnerships and investments in AI, particularly with OpenAI, to consolidate its market leadership. Today's $100 billion investment dramatically escalates this commitment, positioning Nvidia as the undisputed architect of future AI infrastructure, especially after Microsoft stepped back. This strategic lock-in with a key AI innovator, coupled with Nvidia's assurance of stable GPU supply, is likely to further propel its market valuation and secure long-term revenue streams. Conversely, Intel and AMD face increasing pressure from the structural shift towards Arm architecture, which is projected to redefine desktop computing, demanding urgent strategic adaptation to prevent significant erosion of their traditional x86 market dominance.\n\n### Key Implications\n*   **(Nvidia) --[invests (up to $100 billion, 2025-09-22)]--> (OpenAI)**, solidifying Nvidia's pivotal role in AI infrastructure development and securing a long-term, high-volume customer for its advanced AI chips.\n*   **(Nvidia) --[locks in (as strategic partner, 2025-09-22)]--> (OpenAI)**, creating a symbiotic relationship that deepens Nvidia's influence across the AI ecosystem.\n*   **(Nvidia) --[partners (to produce chips, 2025-09-18)]--> (Intel)**, yet analysts view this as a short-term tactical move for Intel rather than a fundamental turnaround, indicating ongoing challenges for Intel.\n*   The broader industry shift to Arm architecture signals a significant long-term risk for x86-centric companies like Intel and AMD, necessitating strategic pivots to maintain market relevance.\n*   Nvidia's assurance regarding GPU supply post-OpenAI deal mitigates immediate market concerns over potential supply constraints, maintaining stability for its diverse customer base."
