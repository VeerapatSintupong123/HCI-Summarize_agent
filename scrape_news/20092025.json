      "headline": "XRP Sees Huge Surge in Exchange Activity After First ETF Launch",
      "content": "Image by WorldSpectrum from Pixabay\n\n\n\nXRP has witnessed a remarkable surge in exchange activities following the launch of its first-ever exchange-traded fund (ETF). This significant development, which occurred on September 18, 2025, has sparked increased market activity, with XRP’s price initially rising by over 5%. While the price has since adjusted, market analysts remain optimistic that the ETF launch will drive institutional interest, potentially boosting XRP’s price to new highs. This shift comes as XRP gains traction in a regulated market environment.\n\n\n\nSurge in Exchange Inflows and Price Movements\n\nThe launch of the REX-Osprey XRPR ETF on September 18 resulted in a 762% increase in XRP’s exchange inflows. This surge in inflows signals heightened selling pressure, as traders react to the new investment vehicle. Despite a strong initial price rise, XRP’s value has seen a correction, dipping back into the red zone. However, analysts believe the ETF could encourage institutional participation in the market, potentially pushing XRP beyond its previous price records.\n\nOn the day of the ETF launch, XRP experienced a price spike of over 5%, reaching as high as $3.13. While this surge was short-lived, the underlying shift in market dynamics remains significant. The ETF’s introduction has opened a more structured and regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to XRP, which could lead to future inflows and price rallies if the momentum continues.\n\n\n\nInstitutional Access and Market Liquidity\n\nThe REX-Osprey XRPR ETF provides a regulated, tradable exposure to XRP under a 1940 Act structure, creating new avenues for institutional investors who have been previously hesitant due to regulatory concerns. This new product allows investors to gain exposure to XRP without holding the token directly, opening up the market to a broader range of players, including large institutional investors.\n\nThe launch of the ETF has intensified attention on liquidity and custody arrangements in the XRP market. Analysts note that while the market response has been positive, it will be crucial to monitor the inflows and outflows to gauge the true impact of this new product on XRP’s price and long-term stability. The ability to trade XRP within a regulated framework enhances its legitimacy, paving the way for increased participation and new opportunities for liquidity providers.\n\n\n\nXRP Futures and Speculative Activity\n\nThe surge in XRP’s exchange activities has also been reflected in the derivatives market, with XRP futures seeing a notable increase in open interest. This shift suggests that traders are using XRP as a preferred vehicle for short-term speculative plays. As Bitcoin and Solana experience consolidation and selling pressure, XRP has emerged as a popular choice for those seeking to capitalize on short-term momentum.\n\nMarket data indicates that XRP’s open interest in perpetual swaps has surged, while positions in Bitcoin and Solana futures have decreased. This shift in capital suggests that traders are increasingly looking to XRP as a more volatile and potentially lucrative option in the near term. The increase in speculative trading activity highlights the growing appeal of XRP, especially among traders seeking leveraged bets.\n\n\n\nKey Price Levels and Market Outlook\n\nXRP’s price is currently testing key resistance levels, with the immediate resistance at $3.12. If XRP manages to break above this level, analysts predict the next major target could be around $3.59, followed by $4.00. On the downside, $2.60 remains a critical support level, and failure to hold above this threshold could lead to a correction.\n\nDespite the short-term fluctuations, market positioning data suggests a predominantly bullish sentiment, with 78% of Binance accounts holding long positions on XRP. This heavy long positioning could increase the risk of liquidation if the price fails to maintain upward momentum. However, analysts remain hopeful that the ETF-driven optimism could help sustain the bullish trend in the medium term.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nCardano Price Poised For Explosive Growth As SEC Decision Nears\n\nIntel Corporation Stock: Skyrockets On $5B Nvidia Deal And AI Collaboration\n\nBitcoin ETFs Surge With 20,685 BTC Inflows, Marking Strongest Week",

      "headline": "1 of the Best Semiconductor Stocks Investors Can Buy Right Now",
      "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest semiconductor foundry by far.\n\nSemiconductor stocks are a critical part of any major technological trend. Without cutting-edge chips, the innovative technology we enjoy today wouldn't be possible. Furthermore, there aren't a ton of chip foundries out there, so if there's a new technology or trend that requires a ton of chips, there are relatively few companies that benefit.\n\nThe Motley Fool did research into the biggest semiconductor companies by revenue and found that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%) generated the most revenue by far of any semiconductor manufacturer. Even though it's the biggest, I think Taiwan Semi (or TSMC, as it's also known) is also the best semiconductor stock you can buy right now, especially with how closely tied it is to the biggest growth trends on the market.\n\nTSMC is the primary chip supplier for several AI giants\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading chip foundry for logic chips. This has positioned it perfectly to take advantage of the AI arms race, as some of its biggest clients are Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom. Considering how much AI hyperscalers are spending on computing equipment to build out their AI capabilities, these three companies are thriving -- and with all of them getting their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor, it is, too.\n\nPart of the reason why TSMC has risen to the top is its commitment to continuous innovation. Taiwan Semiconductor's current best-performing chip is of the 3 nanometer variety. This naming convention is tied to the distance between electrical traces on a chip, so a 3nm chip implies 3nm spacing between traces.\n\nTaiwan Semi's next chip node is a 2nm chip, which doesn't sound like a massive increase, but it allows them to decrease the spacing between traces by 50%. The benefits of this are enormous, and TSMC estimates that a chip configured for the same speed as a 3nm chip will consume 25% to 30% less power. With how much power these giant data centers consume, it's no surprise that the market is demanding more efficient chips.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor estimates that these chips will reach volume production before 2025 is over, but it's not done there. After its 2nm chip node, it is launching an A16 node in 2026, which will have a 15% to 20% power improvement over the 2nm chip. After that, its A14 technology is slated for production in 2028, which provides further improvements.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a continuous innovator, which will keep it on top of the list of top chip foundries for as long as it's committed to that goal. This ties in nicely with the direction of the AI industry, as there is slated to be monster growth over the next five years if Nvidia is right.\n\nThe AI market is expected to boom over the next five years\n\nDuring Nvidia's Q2 conference call, management mentioned it expects global data center capital expenditures to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Currently, the big four AI hyperscalers plan to spend $600 billion this year. That's monster growth, and Taiwan Semiconductor would be slated to grow by a similar amount because it's the primary chip supplier of the various computing units AI companies typically use, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nIn Q2, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue increased at a 44% year-over-year pace in U.S. dollars to $30.07 billion, and if Nvidia's projection is correct, this growth rate won't change a lot over the next five years. This could make Taiwan Semiconductor a must-own stock, especially as new chip technology emerges.\n\nAdditionally, unlike other AI hardware companies (like the three mentioned above), Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't trade at too much of a premium. The stock is valued at 26.6 times forward earnings, which isn't all that cheap, but it's also not terribly expensive.\n\nThis gives TSMC a solid starting spot and makes it a great buy now to capitalize on the massive AI spending that's still to come. I think Taiwan Semiconductor is the best semiconductor stock to buy now, but it's also among the best AI stocks to purchase.",

      "headline": "5 Top AI Stocks Prominent Billionaires Are Buying",
      "content": "Billionaire investors were piling into these names in Q2.\n\nBillionaire portfolio managers typically become billionaires because they are good investors. That is why it can sometimes be smart to make note of the moves these investors are making to see if you might want to do the same.\n\nLet's look at five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that billionaires were buying in Q2 and see if they might help you in your efforts to boost your portfolio.\n\nPhilippe Laffont: Nvidia and Broadcom\n\nPhilippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, which is a technology-focused hedge fund. While he may not be a household name, Laffont manages money for rich and powerful clients, including Amazon (AMZN 0.23%) founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nPublic filings show the billionaire was buying two top AI chip stocks in Q2, adding to his positions in Nvidia (NVDA 0.34%) and Broadcom (AVGO -0.05%). He increased his Nvidia stake by 34% and those shares now account for 5% of his overall portfolio. He upped his Broadcom position by 58%, and it now represents 4.3% of his holdings.\n\nWith Nvidia predicting that AI infrastructure spending could climb from $600 billion to as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade, it's easy to see why Laffont is bullish on AI chip stocks. Nvidia is obviously the undisputed leader and has been the biggest beneficiary of the race to build out new AI data centers. Given the wide moat it's created through its CUDA software platform, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are likely to remain the primary chips powering AI workloads long into the future.\n\nHowever, Broadcom is also becoming a major player in the space by helping customers design custom AI chips. As good as Nvidia's chips are, customers do not want to solely rely on the chip giant, and those with deep pockets that are building massive data centers have been increasingly turning to Broadcom. While custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs, they often can have higher performance and cost savings for the specific task for which they've been designed.\n\nWith AI chip demand surging, both Nvidia and Broadcom look like they will be long-term winners.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller: TSMC\n\nStanley Druckenmiller manages the Duquesne Family Office. This basically means that Druckenmiller became so rich that he no longer needs to manage the money of outside investors and is happy just investing his own money.\n\nDruckenmiller was also investing in the AI chip theme, but instead of buying shares in chip designers, he added to his position in the company that manufactures the advanced chips: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%). Druckenmiller boosted his position by 28%, taking it up to a 4.3% position in his portfolio.\n\nThe beauty of investing in TSMC is that Druckenmiller doesn't have to pick a chip winner. TSMC is currently the only foundry that is able to make advanced chips with a high yield rate (this means with only a few defective chips per wafer) at scale. That has made it a close partner to every chipmaker and given it strong pricing power.\n\nWith the need for AI chips growing and potential in emerging industries like robotaxis and quantum computing, TSMC looks like a long-term winner.\n\nBill Ackman: Amazon and Alphabet\n\nFamed investor Bill Ackman is head of Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman has always been fond of the consumer space, and he's playing AI in much the same way, making a large investment in Amazon in the quarter and increasing his bet on Alphabet (GOOGL 1.23%) (GOOG 1.27%). Amazon was a new investment for Ackman, and it represents a little over 9% of his portfolio, while he boosted his position in Alphabet so it now accounts for 15% of his holdings.\n\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet are cloud computing leaders that are seeing huge demand for their services. They also both have their own custom AI chips, which can help improve performance and reduce costs. This space is booming, and both are investing aggressively to take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nMeanwhile, both companies are also deploying AI to help power their core businesses. Amazon is using AI to make its e-commerce business more efficient. This includes everything from having AI-powered robots in its fulfillment centers to using AI to optimize delivery routes and improve supply chain management. It's also using AI to drive its fast-growing sponsored ad business. This is all leading to strong operating leverage in its retail operations.\n\nAlphabet, on the other hand, is using AI to help power its search business. AI Overviews is leading to more search queries, and it's just started rolling out its new AI Mode globally. In addition, newer features such as Lens and Circle to Search are also driving more queries, with many having a commercial intent (this is when a user is searching for products or services to purchase). With a big distribution advantage through its Chrome browser and Android operating system and a huge global ad network, Alphabet is well-positioned to benefit from AI.\n\nOverall, both Amazon and Alphabet look like long-term AI winners.",

      "headline": "This Fantastic Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is on Track for a Blowout Quarter, and It Could Keep Climbing for Years to Come",
      "content": "Early sales reports show this semiconductor giant far outpacing third-quarter expectations.\n\nBig tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out new data centers for artificial intelligence (AI). The bulk of that spending is going toward semiconductors. That includes server racks full of graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom AI accelerators and networking equipment with the most cutting-edge networking chips inside.\n\nAnd demand for AI-related silicon may continue to grow for the foreseeable future. McKinsey estimates global spend on AI chips and computing hardware for data centers will surpass $3 trillion in 2030.\n\nThe near term is just as bright. And one of the leading semiconductor stocks just shared some news that suggests it could produce another blowout quarter, surpassing its own sales guidance and analysts' expectations.\n\nTSMC: The semiconductor titan behind the AI boom\n\nThere's a lot of debate about the future of AI, how the biggest companies will train their models, and what chips they'll use for inference. Behind all of that stands a single company poised to benefit no matter who wins the next big contract for AI development.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%), known as TSMC, is the largest semiconductor foundry in the world. It commands over 70% of all chip manufacturing spending thanks to its leading-edge process technology and advanced packaging capabilities. It takes contract work from all over the world and with the biggest companies like Nvidia (NVDA 0.34%) and Apple (AAPL 3.25%).\n\nThe Taiwanese company releases sales data every month, and it recently updated investors with its August sales report. The data show the company is well ahead of pace toward its guidance of 939.6 billion New Taiwan dollars in sales this quarter. For the first two months of the period, it's already produced sales of NT$658.9 billion ($21.85 billion). Historically, July and August sales account for about 65% of third-quarter sales, but they already surpass 70% of TSMC's revenue guidance.\n\nThere are a few things that could be leading to the strong performance. Tariff concerns could have pulled in some orders from September to July and August. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs on semiconductors, but TSMC appears to have appeased the U.S. government with its pledge to build out more facilities in Arizona. It's currently exempt from the 100% tariff on semiconductor imports.\n\nOn the other hand, TSMC could have benefited from stronger-than-expected demand continuing to push sales of its leading-edge node. Nvidia resumed production of its H20 units designed for the Chinese market, but it stopped again as the Chinese government urged local companies not to buy them. Still, other AI chipmakers using TSMC's foundry have shown strong growth in demand for their chips. Meanwhile, Apple started ramping up production of new chips for its iPhone 17 launch.\n\nOverall, investors should expect September sales to look more similar to its July and August sales average rather than a steep drop. As a result, third-quarter sales results should surpass current analyst expectations.\n\nThe long-term growth engine for TSMC\n\nTSMC is well-positioned to maintain its dominant position as AI chip spending soars over the next half-decade. Management expects to grow revenue at a compound annual rate of 20% per year from 2024 through 2029, but even that number may be underestimating its potential.\n\nTSMC is the top manufacturer for chipmakers that want the most cutting-edge chips, and its technology lead could grow wider over the coming years. That's because it already dominates the industry with over 70% of total spending on chip fabrication. That gives it a ton of capital to plow into research and development, to push forward its leading-edge node technology and its advanced packaging capabilities. In turn, its next-generation technology drives future demand and provides practically no alternative for those seeking the best technology.\n\nThe strength of TSMC's technology lead is seen in its reported pricing for its next-generation 2nm process. It's reportedly charging $30,000 per wafer, up 50% from its 3nm process. That could be followed by another 50% increase in wafer pricing for its forthcoming 1.6nm process. TSMC is also reportedly raising the price on its older technology by 5% to 10% in 2026.\n\nThose significant price increases should enable TSMC to not only grow its revenue quickly over the next few years, but also be able to maintain its high gross margin profile even as it ramps up its newest technology. That should support very strong earnings growth for the business and its investors.\n\nDespite that potential, the stock currently trades for 26.6 times forward earnings expectations. And if TSMC can continue to outperform those earnings expectations, as its most recent financial update suggests, that could prove an absolute bargain of a price for investors right now.",

      "headline": "This Startup Could Soon Receive \"Trillions of Dollars\" of AI Spending",
      "content": "Its experimental tech could solve OpenAI's biggest barrier to success.\n\nOpenAI just hit a major milestone. According to CFO Sarah Friar, in July, the company notched its first billion-dollar revenue month.\n\nGiven how popular artificial intelligence (AI) is right now, that's not surprising. What is surprising is how much more the company could have earned if it wasn't lacking a resource that CEO Sam Altman says the company will spend \"trillions of dollars\" on developing in the \"not very distant future.\"\n\nHere's what's holding OpenAI back and why startup Oklo (OKLO 28.83%) may be on track to win a significant share of those trillions.\n\nAI unchained\n\nThe biggest obstacle to OpenAI's scalability right now, according to Friar, is access to power, both computing power from powerful GPUs made by Nvidia and the electric power required to run the data centers.\n\n\"In terms of AI, it is voracious right now for GPUs and for [computing power],\" said Friar in an August interview. \"The biggest thing we face is being constantly 'under compute.' That's why we launched Stargate. That's why we're doing the bigger builds.\"\n\nBut Friar doesn't think the current system is sustainable. \"We have to do a lot to figure out how to make data centers more efficient, to think about new ways to power them,\" OpenAI's CFO said. And that's where Oklo comes in.\n\nA new way to power up\n\nIt's telling that Friar specifically referenced finding \"new ways to power\" data centers, because most existing electricity sources are already being used.\n\nFor example, Microsoft -- which has invested $11 billion in OpenAI -- has poured money into building new solar farms to power data centers. It and many other AI-focused companies have also signed contracts with nuclear power plant operators for a guaranteed allocation of their generation capacity. Several data centers are located near hydroelectric dams to ensure reliable supplies of both electricity and water for cooling systems. And, of course, coal and natural gas-fired power plants are currently the primary providers of grid power in the U.S.\n\nHowever, Oklo has proposed one of the few truly \"new\" ways to power a data center: with a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR). While traditional nuclear facilities have massive footprints to house their giant reactors, SMRs can be housed in much smaller facilities. Oklo recently announced a partnership with engineering company Vertiv to develop cooling systems for data centers powered by onsite SMRs that would cool both the servers and the reactor.\n\nWhy Oklo has the edge\n\nA lot of companies are working on SMRs, and while none have yet been able to produce a working prototype -- primarily because of the multi-year regulatory process for all things nuclear -- Oklo has existing ties to OpenAI that would likely place it first in line for OpenAI investment.\n\nOklo went public via a merger with one of Sam Altman's special purpose acquisition corporations (SPACs). Altman himself was chairman of the Oklo board until April, when he stepped down to allow the company to pursue deals with other AI companies without a conflict of interest.\n\nThe company believes it could have a working prototype by 2027 or possibly even 2026. Once it's able to prove its technology works, it will likely open the floodgates for investment by power-hungry AI companies like OpenAI. While there's certainly some risk -- the company's design could have unforeseen flaws -- investors who buy in now will have the chance at the biggest rewards.",

      "content": "On Friday, U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned after reportedly refusing pressure from the Donald Trump administration to pursue a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James despite investigators finding no evidence of fraud.\n\nSiebert Steps Down Under Pressure\n\nSiebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, announced his resignation in an internal email obtained by ABC News.\n\n\"For the last eight months, I have had the pleasure of leading the finest and most exceptional of DOJ employees,\" he wrote, thanking staff for their commitment to justice.\n\nSources told the publication that President Trump intended to fire Siebert after investigators failed to uncover incriminating evidence in a mortgage fraud probe targeting James. Instead, Siebert chose to step down.\n\nSee Also: Intel Growth Challenges Are Not Over Despite Altera Stake Sale: Analyst\n\nTrump Pushes For Charges Against James\n\nInvestigators launched the probe in April after a referral alleging James falsified records tied to a 2023 Virginia home purchase. After interviewing 15 witnesses over five months, prosecutors found no clear evidence of wrongdoing, the report said.\n\nDespite the findings, Trump insisted Friday that James looks very \"guilty of something\" and said he wanted Siebert \"out\" because Virginia's Democratic senators supported his nomination.\n\n\"When I learned that they voted for him, I said, I don't really want him,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nCritics Call It An Attack On Rule Of Law\n\nJames's attorney, Abbe Lowell, blasted the move as political retribution. \"Firing people until he finds someone who will bend the law to carry out his revenge has been the President's pattern — and it's illegal,\" Lowell said.\n\nThe controversy comes as Trump faces mounting criticism for what opponents describe as a campaign of retaliation against political adversaries, with ongoing probes into Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.\n\nCook is pushing back against Trump's attempt to oust her, after records revealed that one of her properties had been listed as a vacation home—undermining claims of mortgage misrepresentation.\n\nJames, A Frequent Trump Target\n\nJames has clashed with Trump repeatedly, including leading the civil fraud case in New York that concluded he and his family overstated property values to secure favorable loans.\n\nThough a half-billion-dollar penalty was later overturned on appeal, the court upheld findings of fraud.\n\nSiebert's departure leaves the powerful Eastern District of Virginia without a confirmed leader, as both he and his deputy plan to return to line prosecutor roles.\n\nLoading...

      "headline": "Linux Patch Optimizes Networking, Cuts Latency by 20% in Data Centers",
      "content": "Kernel Developer Proposes Bold Changes to Linux Networking Stack\n\nIn a recent submission to the Linux kernel mailing list, developer Cong Wang has put forward a patch aimed at optimizing network performance in high-throughput environments. The proposal, detailed in an email thread archived on LWN.net, seeks to address bottlenecks in packet processing that have plagued data center operations. Wang, known for his contributions to kernel networking, argues that current mechanisms for handling incoming packets lead to unnecessary CPU overhead, particularly in scenarios involving multi-queue network interfaces.\n\nDrawing from real-world deployments at major cloud providers, the patch introduces a novel approach to batching packet reception, potentially reducing latency by up to 20% in benchmark tests. This comes at a time when enterprises are pushing the limits of 100Gbps networks, and any efficiency gains could translate to significant cost savings in power and hardware utilization.\n\nImplications for Data Center Efficiency\n\nIndustry insiders point out that such optimizations are critical as companies like Amazon and Google scale their infrastructures. According to a session recap on faster networking published by LWN.net in June 2025, Wang collaborated with Daniel Borkmann on related discussions at the Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory conference, highlighting the need for streamlined eBPF integrations to complement these changes. The patch modifies the NAPI (New API) polling mechanism, allowing for more adaptive scheduling that aligns better with modern NIC capabilities.\n\nCritics, however, warn that altering core networking code carries risks, including potential regressions in stability for legacy systems. Wang’s email acknowledges these concerns, proposing a configurable toggle to enable the new behavior only in supported environments, ensuring backward compatibility.\n\nTechnical Breakdown of the Patch\n\nDelving deeper, the core of Wang’s submission involves refactoring the softirq handling for network packets. By coalescing interrupts more intelligently, the patch minimizes context switches, a common pain point in virtualized setups. Benchmarks referenced in the mailing list show marked improvements in throughput under heavy load, with tests conducted on AMD EPYC processors yielding consistent results.\n\nThis isn’t Wang’s first foray into networking enhancements; his prior work on TCP congestion control has been integrated into mainline kernels, as noted in various LWN.net weekly editions. The August 28, 2025, edition of LWN.net Weekly briefly touches on ongoing kernel debates, underscoring the community’s interest in such submissions.\n\nPotential Adoption and Challenges Ahead\n\nFor industry players, adopting this patch could mean rethinking deployment strategies. Enterprises running containerized workloads on Kubernetes might see immediate benefits, as the optimizations align well with microservices architectures that demand low-latency networking.\n\nYet, the path to mainline inclusion is fraught with hurdles. Kernel maintainers, including those from Red Hat and SUSE, will scrutinize the code for security implications, especially in light of recent vulnerabilities in similar subsystems. Wang invites feedback in his post, emphasizing collaborative refinement before broader integration.\n\nBroader Impact on Linux Ecosystem\n\nAs Linux continues to dominate server markets, innovations like this reinforce its edge over proprietary alternatives. Analysts estimate that enhancements in networking could boost overall system efficiency by 15%, per internal reports from firms like Intel, which often contribute to such efforts.\n\nUltimately, Wang’s proposal exemplifies the open-source model’s strength: iterative improvements driven by community input. If merged, it could set a precedent for future optimizations, paving the way for even faster, more resilient networks in an era of exploding data demands.",

      "headline": "Maingear PC Review: Customization and Performance in 2025",
      "content": "So, you’re thinking about getting a new gaming PC and Maingear is on your radar. That’s pretty common, they’ve got a reputation for putting out some nice machines. We spent some time with their MG-1 Ultimate to see if it lives up to the hype, especially with all the new hardware out there. This maingear pc review will break down what you get for your money, how it performs, and if it’s the right fit for you.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Maingear MG-1 Ultimate offers strong 4K gaming performance, often matching or beating more expensive systems.\n\nIt’s remarkably quiet even under heavy load, making for a more pleasant gaming experience.\n\nThe PC uses standard components, making future upgrades easier, and the interior build quality is clean.\n\nCustomization options, like swappable front panels, add a fun personal touch, though they come at an extra cost.\n\nWhile the price is high, the MG-1 Ultimate provides a premium, hassle-free experience for those who don’t want to build their own PC.\n\nMaingear MG-1 Ultimate: A Premium Gaming Experience\n\nI remember the day the Maingear MG-1 Ultimate arrived—a huge, sturdy box sitting at my door, promising a whole lot of PC power inside. Unboxing it felt a bit like opening a vault. The packaging was tight and protective, and inside, the MG-1 Ultimate sat cushioned by thick foam and sealed in a dust-resistant bag. Right away, I noticed that Maingear includes every cable and accessory you could need—no missing screws or random extra cables required to get started. There’s also a simple setup manual that walks you through the basic steps. For those who like a clean unboxing, this PC sets a high bar.\n\nFirst Impressions and Design\n\nMy first thought when pulling the MG-1 Ultimate out was how solid and compact it felt for a mid-tower. The custom front panel was an immediate eye-catcher—easy to swap if you want a change in style down the road. The subtle RGB under-lighting isn’t over the top, and the matte finish resists fingerprints. At about 32 pounds, it’s not feather-light, but moving it around isn’t a two-person job either. Ports are accessible and the case feels premium but not gaudy. This is a setup that looks just as good in a sleek office as it does in a gaming den. Advertisement\n\nStandout physical design features:\n\nFront-facing USB-C and multiple USB-A ports\n\nA clean, easy-to-remove side panel for upgrades\n\nOptional custom graphics on the front panel\n\nCustomization Options\n\nOne thing that struck me early was the sheer amount of customization that Maingear allows for this PC. Whether you’re going for the entry-level Silver edition or the maxed-out Ultimate, there’s a configuration for just about every kind of gamer. You can pick between high-end AMD or Intel CPUs, a spread of Nvidia GPUs, and customize everything from RAM size to storage and RGB accents.\n\nTo make it even clearer, here’s a quick table showing how the MG-1 line is set up:\n\nEdition CPU Options GPU Options RAM Storage Starting Price Silver Intel Core i5-13400F Nvidia RTX 4060 16GB DDR5 1TB SSD $1,299 Legendary Intel Core i9-13900K Nvidia RTX 4080 32GB DDR5 2TB SSD $3,399 Ultimate AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D / Intel i9-14900K Nvidia RTX 5090 32GB-64GB DDR5 2TB+ SSD $4,699+\n\nThere are even more options if you want to go wild, from custom cooling setups to logo engraving. You end up with a gaming PC that’s really yours—not just a generic box with lights on it. If you want to see how the MG-1 compares to DIY builds and other high-end machines, performance and pricing reviews offer a full breakdown.\n\nOverall, taking the MG-1 Ultimate out of the box and setting it up felt like setting up something special. The variety of customization, easy setup, and snappy design suggest it’s for anyone who wants their next gaming PC to be a statement piece that works as good as it looks.\n\nPerformance Benchmarks and Gaming Capabilities\n\nSo, how does the Maingear MG-1 Ultimate actually perform when you fire up some of the latest games? Well, it’s pretty impressive, especially considering its more compact size compared to some other high-end rigs. This machine is built to handle 4K gaming without breaking a sweat.\n\nWhen I pushed the MG-1 Ultimate with demanding titles at 4K resolution and maxed-out settings, it generally kept up nicely. Games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Lords of the Fallen were hitting well over 100 frames per second, which is fantastic. Even Cyberpunk 2077, known for being a real system hog, managed a solid 135.4 fps at 4K Ultra. It’s not always hitting the absolute highest numbers compared to some much larger and more expensive systems, but the difference is often small, and frankly, hard to notice in real-time gameplay.\n\nHere’s a look at how it stacked up in some popular games at 4K Ultra settings:\n\nGame Maingear MG-1 (4K/Ultra) Baldur’s Gate 3 137.6 fps Cyberpunk 2077 135.4 fps Lords of the Fallen 135.6 fps Starfield 94.4 fps Forza Motorsport 85 fps\n\nWhat’s really notable is how quiet the system stays, even when it’s working hard. You can game for hours at 4K, and the fans are barely audible. This is a big win for anyone who wants a powerful PC that doesn’t sound like a jet engine taking off. The synergy between the CPU and GPU seems well-balanced, allowing for smooth performance across the board. Even in productivity tasks like video editing, the MG-1 Ultimate held its own, outperforming some pricier competitors in our tests. It’s a strong showing for a system that doesn’t take up a massive amount of desk space, making it a great option if you’re looking for serious power without the usual bulk. If you’re curious about how different GPUs perform, checking out a GPU hierarchy can give you a better idea of what to expect.\n\nInternal Build Quality and Accessibility\n\nWhen you’re spending good money on a pre-built machine like the Maingear MG-1, you want to know it’s put together well. It’s not just about how it looks on the outside, but what’s going on under the hood. Honestly, Maingear does a pretty solid job here, making it feel like a machine built by people who actually know their way around a PC.\n\nStandardized Components\n\nOne of the biggest pluses for the MG-1 is that it mostly sticks to standard, off-the-shelf parts. This is huge for anyone who might want to upgrade or fix something down the line. Unlike some other pre-builts that use weird, proprietary bits, Maingear uses parts you can actually find. The only real exceptions are the case itself and maybe the specific AiO cooler they use, but even those are generally based on industry-standard designs. This means you aren’t locked into their ecosystem forever. It’s good to know that if, say, your power supply kicks the bucket, you can just grab a standard ATX PSU and swap it in without a fuss. This approach really sets it apart from systems that feel like they’re designed to be disposable.\n\nEase of Access for Upgrades\n\nGetting inside the MG-1 is pretty straightforward. The side panels come off without too much trouble, and once you’re in, things are generally laid out in a way that makes sense. You can usually get to the RAM slots, storage drives, and graphics card without needing to remove a bunch of other stuff first. This makes future upgrades, like adding more memory or swapping out a GPU, a much less daunting task. It’s clear they thought about the user who might want to tinker a bit, which is always a good sign. It’s not quite as simple as some custom builds where every screw is captive, but it’s definitely better than many pre-builts out there. For instance, swapping out the graphics card is usually a simple matter of unscrewing it and pulling it out, assuming the case has enough room, which the MG-1 generally does.\n\nCable Management and Aesthetics\n\nMaingear clearly put effort into making the inside look tidy. The cables are routed pretty neatly, mostly hidden away behind the motherboard tray. This not only looks good but also helps with airflow, keeping things cooler. You won’t find a giant rat’s nest of wires getting in the way when you need to access a component. They even include a little booklet with the PC, signed by the people who worked on it, which is a nice touch. It makes you feel like there was some personal investment in the build. While they use zip ties for some of the cabling, which aren’t as convenient as Velcro straps for quick adjustments, the overall result is a clean and professional-looking interior. It’s a stark contrast to some systems where the cable management looks like an afterthought, making it hard to even identify what cable goes where. This attention to detail is something you really appreciate when you consider the advancements in laptop design that also prioritize clean internals for better user experience.\n\nKey Features and Design Choices\n\nWhen you’re looking at a pre-built PC like the Maingear MG-1, it’s not just about the raw power inside, but also how it’s put together and what makes it stand out. Maingear has definitely put some thought into the design here, aiming for a balance between looks and practicality.\n\nSwappable Front Panels\n\nOne of the neat things about the MG-1 is the option for swappable front panels. This lets you change up the look of your PC without having to buy a whole new case. Whether you want a cleaner, more minimalist vibe or something with a bit more flair, this feature gives you that flexibility. It’s a small touch, but it adds to the overall customization aspect that Maingear is known for. You can really make the machine your own with these options.\n\nAiO Cooler Placement Considerations\n\nNow, about the AiO (All-In-One) cooler. While Maingear uses a solid 360mm unit, its placement in the MG-1 isn’t always the most ideal. Sometimes, the hoses can be a bit cramped, which might not be the absolute best for long-term cooling efficiency or ease of maintenance. It’s not a deal-breaker, especially since the cooling performance is still good, but it’s something to be aware of if you’re really particular about every component being in its perfect spot. It’s a bit of a trade-off for the overall case design, I suppose.\n\nDust Filtration\n\nKeeping dust out is always a concern for PC builders, and Maingear has included dust filters on the MG-1. However, some of these could be a bit finer. While they do a decent job of catching larger particles, finer dust can still sneak through, especially on certain intake points. This means you might find yourself needing to clean the internals a bit more often than you would with a system that has more robust filtration. It’s a minor point, but for a premium build, you’d hope for top-notch dust control. Still, it’s better than having no filters at all, and you can always look into aftermarket solutions if this becomes a major issue for you. For most users, the included filters should be adequate, but it’s worth noting for those who want the absolute best protection for their expensive components.\n\nValue Proposition and Pricing\n\nThe Cost of Customization\n\nSo, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: price. Maingear’s MG-1 Ultimate isn’t exactly a budget buy. When you configure a system like the one reviewed, with top-tier components and that signature Maingear build quality, you’re looking at a significant investment. Building a similar setup yourself on a site like PCPartPicker might save you a few hundred dollars, especially if you can snag components at their suggested retail prices, which, let’s be honest, is often a challenge. The difference can be around $500 or more, depending on the exact parts and current market availability. This premium is largely for the convenience, the expert assembly, and the peace of mind that comes with a solid warranty and dedicated customer support.\n\nComparing to DIY Builds\n\nWhen you compare the MG-1 Ultimate to a do-it-yourself build, it’s a trade-off. You save money by building it yourself, but you also take on the responsibility of sourcing parts, assembly, troubleshooting, and handling individual component warranties. Maingear handles all of that for you. They use standardized parts, which is great for future upgrades, but the labor and the brand name definitely add to the final cost. It’s like buying a custom-tailored suit versus getting one off the rack – both can look good, but one comes with a higher price tag for the personalized service.\n\nWarranty and Customer Support\n\nOne area where Maingear shines is in its support structure. They offer a decent warranty, and importantly, they provide in-house customer support. This is a big deal for many people. If something goes wrong, you’re not trying to track down the manufacturer of a specific faulty component; you’re dealing directly with Maingear. For those who aren’t comfortable troubleshooting PC issues themselves, or who simply value their time, this support can be worth a good chunk of that price difference. It’s about having a safety net, and knowing that if your expensive new rig acts up, there’s a team ready to help you get it sorted. This is especially important as PCs become more integrated into our lives, with future innovations promising even more connectivity and complexity, like the potential for wireless charging and advanced biometric logins [92ad].\n\nHere’s a general breakdown of what you might expect to pay for a comparable build versus the Maingear MG-1 Ultimate:\n\nComponent Category DIY Estimated Cost Maingear MG-1 Ultimate (Approx.) CPU & Motherboard $600 – $900 $800 – $1100 GPU $550 – $800 $700 – $900 RAM (64GB) $150 – $200 $200 – $250 Storage (2TB SSD) $100 – $150 $150 – $200 Case & Cooling $150 – $250 $250 – $400 Total Estimated $1550 – $2300 $2100 – $2850\n\nNote: These are rough estimates and can vary significantly based on specific component choices and market prices.\n\nMaingear MG-1: Who Is It For?\n\nSo, after all this talk about the Maingear MG-1 Ultimate, you might be wondering if this machine is actually for you. It’s definitely not your average computer, and the price tag alone puts it in a specific category.\n\nTarget Audience for High-End PCs\n\nThis PC is really aimed at people who want top-tier performance without the hassle of building it themselves. If you’re someone who wants to play the latest games at 4K with all the settings cranked up, and you want it to be quiet while doing it, then the MG-1 is worth a look. It’s for the gamer who appreciates a clean build, free of extra software you don’t need, right out of the box. Think of it as a premium product for those who value both aesthetics and raw power, and are willing to pay for that convenience and quality. It’s a machine that looks good on a desk and performs even better, making it a solid choice for enthusiasts who want a hassle-free, high-end experience.\n\nBalancing Performance and Price\n\nLet’s be real, these machines aren’t cheap. The MG-1 Ultimate, especially when kitted out with the best components like an RTX 5090, can easily cost upwards of $5,000. That’s a serious chunk of change. However, when you compare its performance to other PCs in that same high-end bracket, it often holds its own, sometimes even outperforming more expensive options. It’s about getting a lot of bang for your buck, if your buck is already in the five-figure range. You’re paying for the custom build, the quiet operation, and the ease of access for future upgrades. It’s a trade-off, for sure, but one that many enthusiasts find worthwhile for the overall package. You can check out the different configurations Maingear offers to see how the price scales with performance.\n\nA Worthy Investment for Enthusiasts\n\nIs it a worthy investment?

      "headline": "Former Intel Directors Call For Trump And Nvidia To Take Chip Giant Private: 'Hope Is Not A Strategy' - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)",
      "content": "Four former Intel directors, including former U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and former FCC Chair Reed Hundt, are calling for Intel Corp. INTC to go private as the company struggles to regain its footing in the global semiconductor market.\n\nWriting in Fortune, they argued that Intel's conglomerate structure is outdated and that separating design and manufacturing units is critical to restoring competitiveness.\n\nCheck out the current price of INTC stock here.\n\nIntel, once the undisputed leader in both chip design and fabrication, has faced years of declining performance while rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) surged ahead. Now, with the Donald Trump-led U.S. government holding just under a 10% stake and Nvidia Corp. NVDA owning about 5%, the former directors see an opening. \"Without the pressure of delivering quarterly earnings, a private Intel could divide itself into parts that no longer make sense to be conjoined,\" they wrote.\n\nGovernment Orchestration Required\n\nTheir proposal calls for the government, alongside major U.S. tech firms such as Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Qualcomm QCOM, to buy out Intel's public shareholders. The company's manufacturing arm could then be rebuilt into a foundry capable of challenging TSMC, while design businesses for personal computers, servers, and autonomous driving (via its Mobileye subsidiary) could be sold or spun out. They estimate the foundry has a book value of $70 billion but needs as much as $100 billion in new capital to compete globally.\n\nThe move follows a dramatic 28% surge in Intel's stock price following Thursday’s announcement.\n\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan lately called the partnership both personal and strategic, praising Nvidia’s Jensen Huang as a “good friend” and stressing how their collaboration will play a key role in shaping the future of AI infrastructure and personal computing.\n\nPlan Echoes General Electric's Breakup\n\nThe plan echoes General Electric's breakup, which unlocked shareholder value after years of stagnation. Critics may argue Intel can recover without intervention, but the former directors say such expectations are unrealistic in today's market. \"Hope is not a strategy,\" they noted, stressing that only government-led restructuring can deliver long-term security for America's chip ecosystem.\n\nIf executed, they argue, the overhaul could be completed within a year, creating jobs, safeguarding national security, and generating potentially hundreds of billions in taxpayer returns.\n\nSee Also: Dave Ramsey’s ‘Zero Credit’ Doctrine Challenged By Protégé: The New Rules For Building Wealth In 2025\n\nAnalysts Project Major Revenue Potential\n\nBank of America BAC expects the Nvidia-Intel partnership could bring in $25-50 billion in annual revenue over the long term, describing it as a “historic collaboration.” Meanwhile, JPMorgan JPM analyst Harlan Sur kept Nvidia’s Overweight rating at $215, saying that “more value is expected to go to Nvidia.”\n\nGoldman Sachs GS sees the partnership as a setback for both Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Arm Holdings ARM, potentially weakening AMD’s position in the enterprise server market.\n\nPrice Action: According to Benzinga Pro data, the California-based tech giant closed at $29.58 on Friday, down by 3.24%.\n\nWith strong momentum in the 82nd percentile, Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings show that INTC has a positive price trend over all time periods.

      "headline": "Nvidia's CEO Just Delivered Incredible News for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock Investors",
      "content": "TSMC is set to benefit from continued massive spending in AI.\n\nWhen Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), investors listen. Huang recently predicted that global spending on AI infrastructure will surge from $600 billion this year to as much as $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade. That is a massive increase, and it is going to require a lot of advanced chips.\n\nHuang also recently went out of his way to praise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%), calling it \"one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity\" and saying that \"anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person.\" Coming from the head of the world's most valuable company, that is not the kind of endorsement you hear every day.\n\nWhat makes TSMC special\n\nManufacturing semiconductors isn't easy. It requires technological expertise, and fabs (manufacturing facilities) need to be running near full capacity to be profitable. The process for making these complex chips can involve 700-plus steps, with the potential for excess waste overshadowing each step. Such complexity means producing these chips at scale requires real expertise. That is why today most chipmakers don't make their own chips, but instead send their designs to contract manufacturers.\n\nThat is where TSMC comes in. It is the world's leading semiconductor contract manufacturer and the company that advanced chip designers turn to when they need their designs manufactured at scale. It runs the most advanced chipmaking facilities on the planet, known as foundries, and is the clear leader in producing advanced chips, like graphics processing units (GPUs), with the smallest nodes. Smaller nodes pack more transistors on each chip, which makes them faster and more efficient. This is not easy to do, and rivals like Intel and Samsung have struggled to match TSMC's yields.\n\nThat is why every major AI chipmaker, from Nvidia to Broadcom to AMD, relies on TSMC. It wins no matter who comes out on top in the AI chip design race, because they all need its manufacturing expertise.\n\nTSMC's advantage is more than just its scale. It has consistently led the industry in shrinking node sizes and moving production into high volume quickly. Nearly three-quarters of its revenue now comes from chips built on nodes of 7 nanometers or smaller, with 3nm chips already making up nearly a quarter. The company is already preparing to roll out 2nm production, keeping it ahead of competitors and locking in its customers for years to come.\n\nThat technological lead has given TSMC strong pricing power. It has been able to steadily raise prices while still keeping its customers happy, which is why its gross margin has climbed over the last several years even as it spends heavily on new fabs.\n\nThe AI opportunity is massive, and TSMC is in the perfect spot to capture it. The company has said that AI chip demand should grow at more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. That is the kind of growth runway that few companies can match, and it gives TSMC years of visibility into its own expansion. It is already working closely with its largest customers to secure capacity and meet their growing demand.\n\nAI is not the only major growth driver either. If robotaxis really do start lining city streets later this decade, they will each need multiple powerful chips to process real-time driving data safely. That could become another huge market for TSMC. The same goes for emerging technologies like robotics and quantum computing, which will require cutting-edge chips. Wherever computing power is headed, TSMC is likely to be right in the middle of it.\n\nIs TSMC stock a buy?\n\nDespite its critical role in the semiconductor ecosystem, TSMC still flies a bit under the radar. It is also currently one of the best values in the semiconductor space, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 times based on analysts' 2026 estimates, despite the huge growth still in front of it.\n\nInvestors looking for a way to play the AI infrastructure buildout should take Huang's advice seriously. TSMC is one of the best-positioned companies in the world to benefit from the coming AI spending boom, and it might just be the smartest stock to buy and hold through the next decade.",

      "headline": "Wall Street Sets Records As Fed Cuts Rates, Signals More Ahead - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)",
      "content": "Wall Street climbed to fresh record highs after the Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut in nine months — hinting that more reductions could be on the way.\n\nVOO ETF has set new all-time highs this week. Check live chart here.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones and small-cap Russell 2000 all closed at all-time highs as investors celebrated the Fed's move.\n\nFed Rate Cuts\n\nAt its September meeting, the central bank lowered rates by 25 basis points to a target range of 4%–4.25%, in line with expectations, as policymakers shifted their focus toward a cooling labor market.\n\nThe decision wasn't unanimous: Fed Gov. Stephen Miran — appointed by President Donald Trump to replace Adriana Kugler, who resigned last month — argued for a deeper 50-basis-point cut.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell called the move a \"risk management cut,\" stressing that the Fed acted preemptively to avoid a sharper labor market slowdown. He also played down inflationary pressures from tariffs, describing them as a temporary, one-off factor in the Fed's baseline outlook.\n\n“A reasonable base case is that the [tariff] effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived,” Powell said.\n\nThe Fed's updated projections raised both growth and inflation estimates. Yet its rate forecast painted a more aggressive cutting path: two more reductions by the end of 2025, followed by one each in 2026 and 2027.\n\nHow Will Rate Cuts Impact Homebuyers?\n\nRate-sensitive sectors are already showing signs of revival. Mortgage demand spiked ahead of the Fed's decision, with homebuyers rushing to refinance.\n\nIn the week ending Sept. 12, total mortgage applications surged 29.7% from the prior week, while refinancing activity jumped 57.7% — the highest level since March 2022, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\nIntel’s Surge\n\nIntel Corp. INTC was the standout stock of the week. Shares jumped 23% on Thursday after NVIDIA Corp. NVDIA revealed a $5 billion investment in Intel common stock at $23.28 per share, giving it roughly a 5% stake. The investment is part of a broader partnership to co-develop multiple generations of custom chips for data centers and PCs.\n\nFord Slumps, Auto Recall\n\nFord Motor Co. F, meanwhile, posted its third straight weekly loss. The automaker recalled 101,944 U.S. vehicles after regulators warned that faulty door trim could detach while driving, posing a crash risk, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nLoading...

      "content": "On Friday, U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned after reportedly refusing pressure from the Donald Trump administration to pursue a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James despite investigators finding no evidence of fraud.\n\nSiebert Steps Down Under Pressure\n\nSiebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, announced his resignation in an internal email obtained by ABC News.\n\n\"For the last eight months, I have had the pleasure of leading the finest and most exceptional of DOJ employees,\" he wrote, thanking staff for their commitment to justice.\n\nSources told the publication that President Trump intended to fire Siebert after investigators failed to uncover incriminating evidence in a mortgage fraud probe targeting James.

      "headline": "XRP Sees Huge Surge in Exchange Activity After First ETF Launch",
      "content": "Image by WorldSpectrum from Pixabay\n\n\n\nXRP has witnessed a remarkable surge in exchange activities following the launch of its first-ever exchange-traded fund (ETF). This significant development, which occurred on September 18, 2025, has sparked increased market activity, with XRP’s price initially rising by over 5%. While the price has since adjusted, market analysts remain optimistic that the ETF launch will drive institutional interest, potentially boosting XRP’s price to new highs. This shift comes as XRP gains traction in a regulated market environment.\n\n\n\nSurge in Exchange Inflows and Price Movements\n\nThe launch of the REX-Osprey XRPR ETF on September 18 resulted in a 762% increase in XRP’s exchange inflows. This surge in inflows signals heightened selling pressure, as traders react to the new investment vehicle. Despite a strong initial price rise, XRP’s value has seen a correction, dipping back into the red zone. However, analysts believe the ETF could encourage institutional participation in the market, potentially pushing XRP beyond its previous price records.\n\nOn the day of the ETF launch, XRP experienced a price spike of over 5%, reaching as high as $3.13. While this surge was short-lived, the underlying shift in market dynamics remains significant. The ETF’s introduction has opened a more structured and regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to XRP, which could lead to future inflows and price rallies if the momentum continues.\n\n\n\nInstitutional Access and Market Liquidity\n\nThe REX-Osprey XRPR ETF provides a regulated, tradable exposure to XRP under a 1940 Act structure, creating new avenues for institutional investors who have been previously hesitant due to regulatory concerns. This new product allows investors to gain exposure to XRP without holding the token directly, opening up the market to a broader range of players, including large institutional investors.\n\nThe launch of the ETF has intensified attention on liquidity and custody arrangements in the XRP market. Analysts note that while the market response has been positive, it will be crucial to monitor the inflows and outflows to gauge the true impact of this new product on XRP’s price and long-term stability. The ability to trade XRP within a regulated framework enhances its legitimacy, paving the way for increased participation and new opportunities for liquidity providers.\n\n\n\nXRP Futures and Speculative Activity\n\nThe surge in XRP’s exchange activities has also been reflected in the derivatives market, with XRP futures seeing a notable increase in open interest. This shift suggests that traders are using XRP as a preferred vehicle for short-term speculative plays. As Bitcoin and Solana experience consolidation and selling pressure, XRP has emerged as a popular choice for those seeking to capitalize on short-term momentum.\n\nMarket data indicates that XRP’s open interest in perpetual swaps has surged, while positions in Bitcoin and Solana futures have decreased. This shift in capital suggests that traders are increasingly looking to XRP as a more volatile and potentially lucrative option in the near term. The increase in speculative trading activity highlights the growing appeal of XRP, especially among traders seeking leveraged bets.\n\n\n\nKey Price Levels and Market Outlook\n\nXRP’s price is currently testing key resistance levels, with the immediate resistance at $3.12. If XRP manages to break above this level, analysts predict the next major target could be around $3.59, followed by $4.00. On the downside, $2.60 remains a critical support level, and failure to hold above this threshold could lead to a correction.\n\nDespite the short-term fluctuations, market positioning data suggests a predominantly bullish sentiment, with 78% of Binance accounts holding long positions on XRP. This heavy long positioning could increase the risk of liquidation if the price fails to maintain upward momentum. However, analysts remain hopeful that the ETF-driven optimism could help sustain the bullish trend in the medium term.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nCardano Price Poised For Explosive Growth As SEC Decision Nears\n\nIntel Corporation Stock: Skyrockets On $5B Nvidia Deal And AI Collaboration\n\nBitcoin ETFs Surge With 20,685 BTC Inflows, Marking Strongest Week",

      "headline": "Think Ahead: We’re Eyeing Up The Fed",
      "content": "Image Source: Pexels\n\n\n\nHave you been wondering what emoji best describes this week's Fed meeting? James Smith is doing his best to win over Gen-Z again this week, as he looks back at a curious US interest rate decision and weighs up Europe's fiscal woes. All that and more in our guide to the week ahead.\n\nLet it not be said I don’t address the important questions in these articles, so here’s this week’s: what emoji best describes this week’s Fed meeting?\n\nWe could get carried away [Ed: the aubergine is banned], so perhaps we should go with the monocle emoji. You know, a bit sceptical, curious, and all a bit sophisticated. Because this week’s decision was a bit… weird.\n\nOn the one hand, the Fed cut rates. It told us the precarious jobs market would probably justify back-to-back cuts this year, a bolder signal than many had expected.\n\nYet officials also upgraded their growth and nudged down their unemployment rate predictions. Powell repeated his now-familiar mantra that the jobs slowdown is primarily down to immigration – and fewer workers – rather than tariffs – and lower hiring demand. He said the Fed needn’t be in a rush when asked why officials didn’t cut rates by 50bp this week.\n\nThe easiest way of squaring that rather peculiar circle, as James Knightley explained in his reaction piece, is that the Fed thinks its rate cuts will be enough to keep the US economy humming along.\n\nThere’s plenty to debate in all of that, but it is true that even without rate cuts, it’s still not totally clear how weak the US economy really is right now. A quick glance at the PMIs, which we get next week, points to respectable growth. And real consumer spending growth – another of next week’s key releases – has slowed, but not disastrously so. It’s running at 2% on an annual basis, down from 3% in much of 2024.\n\nBut there are signs that could change. James K highlights the housing market, where prices have fallen for the past four months, having risen consistently since aggressive rate hikes prompted a modest correction through 2022. That has all the makings of a major headwind for consumer spending, in an economy where housing is the largest segment of household wealth.\n\nThen there’s the tariffs, where so far, revenue hasn’t been as high as you might think. My spreadsheet is telling me the average tariff rate across all American imports is 18% right now. Yet the actual effective tariff, if you divide the tariff money coming into the Treasury’s coffers by the value of imports, is considerably lower. There are a whole host of reasons as to why that could be, but most think it’s only a matter of time before those revenues catch up.\n\nFor now, though, that might help explain why goods inflation, though rising, hasn’t surged so far. Next week’s core PCE deflator – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – will probably look fairly benign. And it’s why the pressure on the US economy could still continue to build: more inflation, but also more pressure on the demand side of the US jobs market.\n\nA difficult backdrop, but one which suggests markets are right to be pricing a little more easing than the Fed’s latest ‘dot plot’ intimated this week. We’re predicting two more cuts this year, and two in 2026.\n\nOver here in Europe, the growth data also looks surprisingly “OK.\" For all the tariff noise, the manufacturing PMI has climbed over the summer. The service sector is holding up. The unemployment rate is at an all-time low in the eurozone. It’s why the ECB is in its happy place and why the bar for another rate cut is high (though as Carsten writes, not unattainable).\n\nA lot – maybe everything – rests on German fiscal stimulus shining through over the next twelve months, at a time when politics hangs over the outlook. My colleague Charlotte reminded us this week that the prospect of France reducing its deficit below 5% next year – let alone 3% later this decade – is rapidly diminishing. Remember, the French tax burden tops European league tables.\n\nThe opposite is true here in the UK, where tax/GDP is 38%, well below France at 52% (I’m using IMF figures here). It means that, faced with a large budget hole to fill this Autumn, revenue raisers are easier to identify, even if not exactly compatible with the government’s wider growth ambitions.\n\nThe problem is that, by our maths, the government needs to find at least £30bn/year to retain the same fiscal 'headroom' it had in the spring. That’s down to both forecast downgrades and spending pressures. It’s going to be hard to raise that sort of cash without lifting one of the major taxes, like income tax or National Insurance. And politically, the real elephant in the room in Westminster is that the average worker is taxed much less than in most other OECD countries (including employer contributions).\n\nThe temptation to play around with the fiscal rules – thereby lifting borrowing yet avoiding tough decisions on tax – is something investors are closely monitoring. But assuming we do get big tax hikes, then that’s a decent reason to think the Bank of England isn’t quite done with rate cuts.\n\nAs for an emoji to describe Europe's fiscal woes? Well, I'll leave that up to your imagination...\n\n\n\nTHINK Ahead in developed markets\n\n\n\nUnited States (James Knightley)\n\nSpeeches: Over the coming week, we will be hearing from numerous Fed officials after the recent decision to resume rate cuts. We will get more information on how each individual FOMC member is seeing the risks to the economy after signalling their central projection is for two further 25bp rate cuts this year and one more next year.\n\nOver the coming week, we will be hearing from numerous Fed officials after the recent decision to resume rate cuts. We will get more information on how each individual FOMC member is seeing the risks to the economy after signalling their central projection is for two further 25bp rate cuts this year and one more next year. PCE (Fri): In terms of the data the highlight will be the core personal consumer expenditure deflator – the Fed’s favoured measure of inflation. Core CPI rose a relatively hot 0.3%MoM, but the core PCE is likely to be a more benign 0.2%MoM/2.9%YoY outcome given the lower housing weighting and PPI inputs of airline fares and health costs. This should give the green light to further Federal Reserve rate cuts in October and December. In terms of activity, the housing numbers will be in focus as rising supply meets weak demand, generating downside risks to home prices.\n\nEurozone (Bert Colijn)\n\nPurchasing Managers Indices (PMI, Tue): PMIs were very upbeat in August, mainly thanks to a jump in manufacturing. The European Commission’s survey nuanced this view as potentially being a one-off, as expectations for the sector were actually not noticeably strong. For September, this means that the question is whether summer optimism persists or whether this turns out to have been more of a one-off. We consider the latter very possible, given the current sluggishness of the economy.\n\n\n\nTHINK Ahead in Central and Eastern Europe\n\n\n\nPoland (Adam Antoniak)\n\nAug retail sales (Thu): We expect slightly softer retail sales for August on statistical effects, but it should be more than compensated in September and 3Q25 overall is likely to be strong for private consumption. August this year had a lower number of trading days than in 2024 and an outright long weekend (non-working day on Friday, August 15th), which probably trimmed demand for goods, but supported purchases of services (hotels and restaurants). The general trend remains positive. Demand for durable goods is rising and consumer confidence keeps improving. Private consumption should be the main driver of GDP growth in 3Q25.\n\n(Thu): We expect slightly softer retail sales for August on statistical effects, but it should be more than compensated in September and 3Q25 overall is likely to be strong for private consumption.

The general trend remains positive. Demand for durable goods is rising and consumer confidence keeps improving. Private consumption should be the main driver of GDP growth in 3Q25. Unemployment rate (Thu): Domestic gauge of unemployment (registered unemployment) increased more than expected in recent months, but that was mostly linked to administrative changes that slowed the pace of withdrawal from the list of unemployed since June. Labour Force Survey (LFS) data should provide more reliable picture of unemployment developments in 3Q25. In 2Q25, the number of unemployed declined by more than 100K persons, and the unemployment rate in Poland remains among the lowest in the European Union (EU).\n\nHungary (Peter Virovacz)\n\nNBH rate decision (Tue): The main event in Hungary next week is going to be the September rate-setting meeting. However, we don't expect any fireworks. Not much has changed since the previous meeting. The only meaningful change has been the strengthening of the forint, while economic activity data and inflation figures were all broadly in line with the central bank's projections in June. Against this backdrop, we expect only minor changes to the staff projections in the September update, which won’t alter the overall outlook. Despite the strength of the forint, we don’t think the NBH will move away from its hawkish stance, since the stronger currency will improve both the inflation outlook and the debt trajectory.\n\nCzech Republic (David Havrlant)\n\nConfidence (Wed): Both the consumer and business confidence likely improved in September. The rock tour of the ever-stronger koruna over the recent months makes all imports cheaper, being beneficial to household budgets and input costs of firms. At the same time, households are supported by continued robust wage growth, while the Czech industry is bottoming out, observing more optimistic order books.\n\n(Wed): Both the consumer and business confidence likely improved in September.

      "headline": "Former Intel Directors Call For Trump And Nvidia To Take Chip Giant Private: 'Hope Is Not A Strategy' - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)",
      "content": "Four former Intel directors, including former U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and former FCC Chair Reed Hundt, are calling for Intel Corp. INTC to go private as the company struggles to regain its footing in the global semiconductor market.\n\nWriting in Fortune, they argued that Intel's conglomerate structure is outdated and that separating design and manufacturing units is critical to restoring competitiveness.\n\nCheck out the current price of INTC stock here.\n\nIntel, once the undisputed leader in both chip design and fabrication, has faced years of declining performance while rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) surged ahead. Now, with the Donald Trump-led U.S. government holding just under a 10% stake and Nvidia Corp. NVDA owning about 5%, the former directors see an opening. \"Without the pressure of delivering quarterly earnings, a private Intel could divide itself into parts that no longer make sense to be conjoined,\" they wrote.\n\nGovernment Orchestration Required\n\nTheir proposal calls for the government, alongside major U.S. tech firms such as Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Qualcomm QCOM, to buy out Intel's public shareholders. The company's manufacturing arm could then be rebuilt into a foundry capable of challenging TSMC, while design businesses for personal computers, servers, and autonomous driving (via its Mobileye subsidiary) could be sold or spun out. They estimate the foundry has a book value of $70 billion but needs as much as $100 billion in new capital to compete globally.\n\nThe move follows a dramatic 28% surge in Intel's stock price following Thursday’s announcement.\n\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan lately called the partnership both personal and strategic, praising Nvidia’s Jensen Huang as a “good friend” and stressing how their collaboration will play a key role in shaping the future of AI infrastructure and personal computing.\n\nPlan Echoes General Electric's Breakup\n\nThe plan echoes General Electric's breakup, which unlocked shareholder value after years of stagnation. Critics may argue Intel can recover without intervention, but the former directors say such expectations are unrealistic in today's market. \"Hope is not a strategy,\" they noted, stressing that only government-led restructuring can deliver long-term security for America's chip ecosystem.\n\nIf executed, they argue, the overhaul could be completed within a year, creating jobs, safeguarding national security, and generating potentially hundreds of billions in taxpayer returns.\n\nSee Also: Dave Ramsey’s ‘Zero Credit’ Doctrine Challenged By Protégé: The New Rules For Building Wealth In 2025\n\nAnalysts Project Major Revenue Potential\n\nBank of America BAC expects the Nvidia-Intel partnership could bring in $25-50 billion in annual revenue over the long term, describing it as a “historic collaboration.” Meanwhile, JPMorgan JPM analyst Harlan Sur kept Nvidia’s Overweight rating at $215, saying that “more value is expected to go to Nvidia.”\n\nGoldman Sachs GS sees the partnership as a setback for both Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Arm Holdings ARM, potentially weakening AMD’s position in the enterprise server market.\n\nPrice Action: According to Benzinga Pro data, the California-based tech giant closed at $29.58 on Friday, down by 3.24%.\n\nWith strong momentum in the 82nd percentile, Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings show that INTC has a positive price trend over all time periods.

      "headline": "Nvidia's CEO Just Delivered Incredible News for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock Investors",
      "content": "TSMC is set to benefit from continued massive spending in AI.\n\nWhen Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), investors listen. Huang recently predicted that global spending on AI infrastructure will surge from $600 billion this year to as much as $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade. That is a massive increase, and it is going to require a lot of advanced chips.\n\nHuang also recently went out of his way to praise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.59%), calling it \"one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity\" and saying that \"anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person.\" Coming from the head of the world's most valuable company, that is not the kind of endorsement you hear every day.\n\nWhat makes TSMC special\n\nManufacturing semiconductors isn't easy. It requires technological expertise, and fabs (manufacturing facilities) need to be running near full capacity to be profitable. The process for making these complex chips can involve 700-plus steps, with the potential for excess waste overshadowing each step. Such complexity means producing these chips at scale requires real expertise. That is why today most chipmakers don't make their own chips, but instead send their designs to contract manufacturers.\n\nThat is where TSMC comes in. It is the world's leading semiconductor contract manufacturer and the company that advanced chip designers turn to when they need their designs manufactured at scale. It runs the most advanced chipmaking facilities on the planet, known as foundries, and is the clear leader in producing advanced chips, like graphics processing units (GPUs), with the smallest nodes. Smaller nodes pack more transistors on each chip, which makes them faster and more efficient. This is not easy to do, and rivals like Intel and Samsung have struggled to match TSMC's yields.\n\nThat is why every major AI chipmaker, from Nvidia to Broadcom to AMD, relies on TSMC. It wins no matter who comes out on top in the AI chip design race, because they all need its manufacturing expertise.\n\nTSMC's advantage is more than just its scale. It has consistently led the industry in shrinking node sizes and moving production into high volume quickly. Nearly three-quarters of its revenue now comes from chips built on nodes of 7 nanometers or smaller, with 3nm chips already making up nearly a quarter. The company is already preparing to roll out 2nm production, keeping it ahead of competitors and locking in its customers for years to come.\n\nThat technological lead has given TSMC strong pricing power. It has been able to steadily raise prices while still keeping its customers happy, which is why its gross margin has climbed over the last several years even as it spends heavily on new fabs.\n\nThe AI opportunity is massive, and TSMC is in the perfect spot to capture it. The company has said that AI chip demand should grow at more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. That is the kind of growth runway that few companies can match, and it gives TSMC years of visibility into its own expansion. It is already working closely with its largest customers to secure capacity and meet their growing demand.\n\nAI is not the only major growth driver either. If robotaxis really do start lining city streets later this decade, they will each need multiple powerful chips to process real-time driving data safely. That could become another huge market for TSMC. The same goes for emerging technologies like robotics and quantum computing, which will require cutting-edge chips. Wherever computing power is headed, TSMC is likely to be right in the middle of it.\n\nIs TSMC stock a buy?\n\nDespite its critical role in the semiconductor ecosystem, TSMC still flies a bit under the radar. It is also currently one of the best values in the semiconductor space, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 times based on analysts' 2026 estimates, despite the huge growth still in front of it.\n\nInvestors looking for a way to play the AI infrastructure buildout should take Huang's advice seriously. TSMC is one of the best-positioned companies in the world to benefit from the coming AI spending boom, and it might just be the smartest stock to buy and hold through the next decade.",
