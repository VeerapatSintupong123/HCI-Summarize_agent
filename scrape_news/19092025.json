Unlike Nvidia, he continued, much of the market is heavily affected by the Federal Reserve's decision on whether to raise or lower the benchmark overnight borrowing rate. He also mentioned that Nvidia's stock rallied on Thursday after it announced it would invest $5 billion in troubled chipmaker Intel . Cramer pointed out that Nvidia managed to see gains even as the company faces issues selling its chips in China, and he said there is more to the outfit than its business in that country.\n\nBut Nvidia is only \"one of a handful of companies that seems very much in charge of its own destiny,\" he said. He pointed to other members of the Magnificent Seven — Microsoft , Meta , Amazon , Alphabet , Apple and Tesla — which have largely led the market to record-breaking heights over the last few years.\n\n\"When you have a company like Nvidia that's rolling in cash, why would you care about borrowing costs?\" Cramer said.",

      "content": "Nvidia Corp NVDA just handed Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD a fresh headache. The chip giant is teaming up with Intel Corp INTC in a sweeping $5 billion collaboration to co-develop custom CPUs, GPUs, and AI infrastructure, leaving AMD on the outside looking in at a new two-horse race in both data centers and PCs.\n\nTrack AMD stock here.\n\nWhy This Matters For AMD\n\nFor years, AMD has positioned itself as the alternative to Nvidia in AI GPUs and Intel in CPUs, carving out share with its EPYC server processors and Radeon Instinct accelerators.\n\nBut Nvidia's decision to effectively endorse Intel's CPUs — and even integrate RTX GPU chiplets into Intel SOCs — sidelines AMD's value proposition.\n\nInvestors worry this could blunt AMD's push into AI servers just as demand surges, particularly since Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem remains the industry standard.\n\nRead Also: Nvidia Vs. AMD: Who Gets Hit Harder By The 15% China Revenue Tax?\n\nThe Market Dynamics\n\nThe Nvidia–Intel alliance doesn't just carry technical weight; it carries financial heft. Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel underscores its commitment to building a rival CPU-GPU powerhouse.\n\nThat means AMD now faces a duopoly with a formidable moat — Nvidia's AI stack fused with Intel's manufacturing scale and x86 dominance. While AMD has made strides with MI300 accelerators and Xilinx integration, the perception of being the \"third wheel\" could weigh on sentiment unless it delivers breakthrough wins in AI adoption.\n\nFor AMD, the message is clear: the AI arms race just got more crowded. With Nvidia betting on Intel, the pressure is on CEO Lisa Su's team to prove that AMD can still play kingmaker in both AI infrastructure and next-gen PCs — or risk being squeezed by two industry giants closing ranks.\n\nLoading...

      "headline": "Nvidia just spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO, license AI startup's technology",
      "content": "Co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., Jensen Huang attends the 9th edition of the VivaTech trade show in Paris on June 11, 2025.\n\nNvidia has just shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the artificial intelligence hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC has learned.\n\nIn a deal reminiscent of recent AI talent acquisitions made by Meta and Google , Nvidia is paying cash and stock in the transaction, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. The deal closed last week, and Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar has joined Nvidia, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private.\n\nNvidia has served as the backbone of the AI boom that began with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are generally purchased in large clusters, power the training of large language models and allow for big cloud providers to offer AI services to clients.\n\nEnfabrica, founded in 2019, says its technology can connect more than 100,000 GPUs together. It's a solution that could help Nvidia offer integrated systems around its chips so clusters can effectively serve as a single computer.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment, and Enfabrica didn't provide a comment for this story.\n\nWhile Nvidia's earlier AI chips like the A100 were single processors slotted into servers, its most recent products come in tall racks with 72 GPUs installed working together. That's the kind of system inside the $4 billion data center in Wisconsin that Microsoft announced on Thursday.\n\nNvidia previously invested in Enfabrica as part of a $125 million Series B round in 2023 that was led by Atreides Management. The company didn't disclose its valuation at the time, but said that it was a fivefold increase from its Series A funding.\n\nLate last year, Enfabrica raised another $115 million from investors including Spark Capital, Arm, Samsung and Cisco . According to PitchBook, the post-money valuation was about $600 million.\n\nTech giants Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have all poured money into hiring top AI talent through deals that resemble acquihires. The transactions allow the companies to bring in top engineers and researchers without worrying about the regulatory hassles that come with acquisitions.\n\nThe biggest such deal came in June, when Meta spent $14.3 billion on Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and others and took a 49% stake in the AI startup. A month later, Google announced an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf, and other research and development employees in a $2.4 billion deal that also included licensing fees.\n\nLast year, Google made a similar deal to bring in the founders of Character.AI. Microsoft did the same thing for Inflection, as did Amazon for Adept.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been a big investor in AI technologies and infrastructure, it hasn't been a significant acquirer. The company's only billion-dollar-plus deal was for Israeli chip designer Mellanox, a $6.9 billion purchase announced in 2019. Much of Nvidia's current Blackwell product lineup is enabled by networking technology that it acquired through that acquisition.\n\nNvidia tried to buy chip design company Arm , but that deal collapsed in 2022 due to regulatory pressure. In the past year, Nvidia closed a $700 million purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli company whose technology helps software makers optimize their infrastructure for AI.\n\nOn Thursday, Nvidia announced one of its most sizable investments to date. The chipmaker said it's taken a $5 billion stake in Intel , and announced that the two companies will collaborate on AI processors. Nvidia also said this week that it invested close to $700 million in U.K. data center startup Nscale.\n\n— Correction: A prior version of this story mistakenly included the name of a company as an investor in Enfabrica.\n\nWATCH: Nvidia CEO says he's delighted to work with Intel",
